There's a great return of the Czech sculptor.
Pavel Francouz was allowed to NHL
The Czech hockey banker Pavel Francouz, who has been in the last few months through a difficult period of his career, returns to NHL.
One-thirteen-year-old platoon will be on the trigger, and soon he can get to the branch.
The former branch of Lithuania, Plša or Russian Cheljabinsk was injured in preparation for NHL in October of the year.
Exactly half of the contact with Vegas was interrupted and since then NHL has not yet been present at the NHL clubs.
The incident occurred when the experienced banker moved from one line to another.
"Paul Francouz will be about three to four weeks of injury to the lower part of the body," announced a whole from Denver in early October.
His return to the NHL branch finally lasted more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon, he was allowed to leave the farm, where he picked up four duellers and showed his old form.
In AHL, he also contributed 94,5 % of the steps.
The keeper of the platoon hockey finally wants to break up and confirm that the world's best league belongs to him.
In his last year, he had problems with his hips and did not experience one escape in his short pandamic year.
In NHL 'France', 36 runs out, its success in steps is 92.3%.
Charles at the wedding party finds Camille Roosevelt, William and Kate taking a vacation in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during the trip to Jordan.
He also published his wish by Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which his shoe Camille was on the reach helps set up a dress.
On its website, the British BBC reported on this.
They send invitations to friends, colleagues and employers who work with them.
The photograph came from kdesi in the desert country.
The guide from Cambridge is dressed in long summer hats in khaki color and also has Princess Charlotte's dress.
Prince William, the introduction from Cambridge, has the same thing as Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a belt.
Who ordered the photo, William and Kate didn't introduce it, it's not even clear when it came up.
Loni, a royal family for photographs designated as a holiday wish, visited the town of palm trees in his rural village of Norfolk.
A picture that serves as a holiday celebration was also published by Prince Charles and his wife, Camillo.
Photographer Sam Hussein was arrested in June on arrivals in Ascot.
Charles, who's got cylindrical head and face to face, helps Camille put her dress in a colorly decorated with bright clothes.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million dollars for the title, which was claimed.
Praha – Criminalists in the current corruption case have apparently worked with the alleged former vice president of the ČR Roman Berbr Association, who was accused of having committed millions of crowns for medical title in the season 2018/19 from Prague.
He informed the efotbal.cz server of his access to part of the police records.
The president of the summit club, Jaroslav Trdík, stated that no corrupt treatment was allowed by the Red Cross.
The server published a list of police officers, which is mainly composed of her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who graduated in summer from the master club.
Some influential Red Red officials were listed in both the frequent contact with Berbre and the former sports director of the Roman Rogos, who was also involved in the case of the accused.
Criminals may have been working with information that Slavia Berbrov promised a financial reward for getting a title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Praha team title in the first league.
The police authority had a note that, for the league win, Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha officials had a promised million fee, quoted the server from the list.
The next day, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the President of the Slavian Group.
According to the server, it is no longer possible to determine whether the police are still keeping this information.
The claim of any corrupt conduct has been rejected.
In the years 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the ratios in the Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never allowed illegal proceedings, we have never been forced to influence decision makers in conflict with fair play rules and we have not provided any financial support in this regard," said the Order for the Report List.
In the past, besides other Nezmar, he does not choose to insult some former Slavic players with dark cries, and he also speaks to his former chief of troops.
As a result of the data impact on stocks through decision-making, the Loney was split by the police force in half October in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FAČR.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, which is no longer listed in any of the football features.
In the middle of the winter he was just like a former sports director of the Rgoz Highyard.
Wrestlings, tanks and bvp are laryping studied wars.
They'll be new, but in principle they'll be worse.
Car - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good
Founders and various bakery vehicles - at the sound level, they have already managed to free Prague V3S and specialized units.
The planes: combatable, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drons - small and only small types without war potential
rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export abroad)
VAT: medium-study, old; short-term - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have stories like that.
I'll be right next to town.
The rivers were filled with nutrients and caused damage to plants, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat down and the guy didn't look at me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something went out, but of course, she's gone a little late.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman was a little bit down, he had a head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the bed.
Before I got off the property, he was a guy.
Tzn. And louka is supposed to be a hairdresser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it's supposed to be a lot of trouble to happen, probably you'd be seeing on the television that's got almost everyone today.
So in a visible place, expensive things get your feet into the pack and you should be okay.
The leading version of Hamaček.
In-house ventriloquists were significantly lower than the Ministry of Health
The State responsible for the purchase and distribution of raw materials, massages and respiratory devices for the most recent professions of Coronavir has issued a billion crowns on their premises in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the spare parts were lost to hundreds of crowns.
Why are prices so dramatic?
Which agencies were acting economically?
And why did others buy a stake?
Linka Cabrèl speaks with the editor server iRozhlas Dominica Kubisht.
Soldiers and armies are serious (if I am not covered by memories of the ČSLA which have passed away from the older generations), but the ČR will not be able to benefit from the war.
We don't even have large technical reserves that could be understood by training, we don't actually have modern technology or existing professionals, and in addition to modern technology, it's becoming increasingly complex, so the skills of the foundations will be quickly lost in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where anyone can settle, they will play very fast, no time will be spent again.
Finally, the baseland/territory defences are of great importance to the country, such as Ukraine, where it is going to carry a mass guerrilla and it is also a expressed need to scare the enemy.
In the territory of the PRC, there will only be war in the conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where it will already be irrelevant, and we do not have adequate geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play like she's got it.
Then it happens that you look like a guy who doesn't come back for an empty defense two minutes ago, he's going into an attack between 2 or even 3 Swisss and you cry "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course, they're gonna hire him as a average taxpayer.
This situation with this difference of "probation" is so scary that I'm convinced that I'm really surprised when I see our attacker was able to catch up with one of our opponents.
First owners
Covid's pandemic is reminiscent, but experts do not expect any major feedback for the following weeks.
The recovery in hospitals according to statistical models is still going on for some time and has reached a pandemic equivalent, as we know, a new unknown: the variant of micron, which is very likely to spread much faster than in the currently ruling Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious process than it can be expected or post-infective immunity obtained by previous failure.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon was also added to the human balance: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of serious illness and associated third-party hospitalization, can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by paxlovid medicine from Pfizer, which reports success even 85 per cent of the results obtained.
The first supplies of molnupiravir to Česka, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools to combat coronavir pandemics, have also raised the question of how to prepare for future medicines.
As has been said, molnupiravir is first obtained in Turkish patients with Merck.
The company ended up on the grass as the first and because it began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with a view to finding appropriate treatment for viral horse disease on the South American continent.
In this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often forgotten.
they are generally less open and do not share their views.
That's why Eastern Europe, and especially our Czechs, is used to speaking "as our eyes grew".
See if you're doing research where people ask you if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no.
They'll tell you in the West how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we're a racist mob.
And then they go and they like parties like AfD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means loss of work and media link.
Then it looks nice in research, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Pene and Zemmoura, both have more than 20% of the research.
We even know that objects are three and quite identical in Czech.
Identically because of the unit being identified so that soldiers don't want to learn again where it is, all objects are the same.
One of them is Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are left.
It is funny that the Ssr did not want to have its own nuclear head on its own land, either because of safety or the speed of the headset because of the lower position.
In these underground surfaces (there are two in each row) only the heads of none of the entire rockets were kept as it is said.
If it was necessary to put this weapon in place, a special unit that pulled out this head and mounted it on some bone device.
Besides the museum hall, they're in a state of dissolute condition.
At the second level of basic school, we had a colleague from Cigaan, and we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he made good jokes, often when he showed up, but he was such a mask.
He used to play with him every time he went and wanted to figure out something, he missed a bit, he walked around regularly, he got involved in sports with us, he didn't steal anything, he didn't even have phones, he walked out of his mind.
He went to school in the natural world, made a variety of exercises, but he was fine, probably never a prosthesis.
In the eighth or ninth grade, relatives, cigarettes in the same year, other classes.
In the short run, they beat the teacher, solved a lot of police, threatened and threatened other students.
I'm selling myself sometimes something on the inside (old things, things I don't need, etc) and I've been selling to the Cigarettes a lot of times, they always had money, they didn't try to attract me to the price, communication at ease.
I even sold this car, and a guy in a month called out that he had already written it for himself.
I'm saying I'm not racist, I'm one if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, until he behaves as he belongs in a hearing society (workes, works, does not fear women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he finds out his hand, he's living and home, he's just having a mess around him, he's making trouble... so there's one that's my color, but he's gonna mind me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they start with us, start business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in God, I don't care until they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be here too.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious injuries and, despite her resuscitative care, suffered her injuries on the spot," told the Justice of South-South Health Rescuers Zuzan Fijtlová.
Havari was probably the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was likely in the direction of the village of Zíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for the still unknown reasons he went into the alley.
After the war, Škodo Octavia ended up driving Peugeot on the roof outside the train, she described the accident by the South Korean police officer Štépánk Schwarz.
The young driver Peugatus suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was a lot of damage and remained locked in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute prenatal care and was transported in a stable state by air to the Chescobudjevic hospital, found by the rescuer Faytlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a slight injuries to the brain and was transferred to the hospital.
For packages outside the EU, new rules are paid, and customers often do not provide information about them
Lukaš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It's mainly a collection card.
“It can usually be ten dollars, we should say ten dollars higher where it is still going to be imported, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector approaches.
Since October, his order for small consignments has been peacefully passed, the new DPH must be allocated and the mail must be sent to the customs office of destination.
He'll come by e-mailing that the customs officers are waiting for the package to come.
It shall then be sufficient to complete the consignment data and, if DPH has not included the trader at the time of sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total quantity for consignment and transport.
In the event that the address does not ensure the customs procedure itself, the full amount must also be reported by the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two stoppers, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me it's most of a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all cookies can be delivered to the refrigerator.
As a result of the new customs rules, the number of consignments received from foreign countries from 60,000 to 15,000 were posted at international post in Prague.
According to the Czech Posts, the problem is also that people do not respond to the requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30 thousand copies on international mail that we need to work on.
If people fill out all the information they need and fill it in time, then we'd be half a hole here, says the Czech-speaking speaker Matáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and is expected to increase further.
What do you think he should do to slow down this growth or compensate?
We see a need in Poland to reduce DPH on food and PHM, is this for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices increase faster than payments, I think it's inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much do you need to add (who's an employee)?
I've been added 2% this year to the grave, which is high, but luckily I have a similar income from the company I work with.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why violent witnesses are sent on the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't care how the court can only send animals for six months for the net just to do it again as soon as they get out.
6 Months are nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will suffer a stroke for several years, which negatively affects her sexual relations and relationships at all.
And it's not that the victim of rape must never remember it either.
Doesn't this even make a potential future victim rape report?
A man from Hrob "provalil" his friend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob did not want to help the guards to secure his nationally sought friend from Kostomlat, who was ordered to be arrested.
He still called her.
He went to that, but he's been around.
First of all, he used to say a comedian and he thought the story was stolen.
The guards arrived at the site after the call to the front line and were not surprised when a certain "crazed" man told them that he had planned to come to the place.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the guards how to notify the CPR Police.
In checking the identity of the man and his friend, the guards discovered that the woman is on the list of the persons sought in the national patrol and has been ordered to arrest her.
The case is therefore resolved by the CPR.
A real question for people here, do you consider our country to be a Slovenian?
I personally feel that we are no longer ethnic or cultural, but I would be interested in you.
On the other hand, I agree with me, of course, that it is a pity that Churchill has not been able to ensure the release of Prague USA:')
Of course I don't say we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe anything without evidence just because it could possibly bring benefits.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case for true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an idea in the world that if I don't, there's about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will harm you if you believe in another god.
Yet, even in the wilderness, there is no god other than Jehovah.
So in such a case, would it not be more reasonable to maintain faith in any god than to risk that I will choose one of the thousands of gods wrong and that one true god I am not about to meet, send me to hell or some other place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with next booking.
The Swiss model is very similar.
X months of training (in various specialisations, X months per month) and under the promotion of practical experience.
If a person's driving well, he can get a taste of the offer.
I've got all the ACHR components. Something like that would happen.
It would be possible to do this in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk this way: The cooperation between the education sector and industry, the hunting companies in schools, and the work force is moving from the educational institutions to the labour market.
Not only when it comes to breathing, but this process continues, every one of us continues to learn something new, from one range to another.
Similar fluctuations should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I'm also aware of how to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, so the institution that guarantees that it will never enter Russia, Germany or need a Mongolian passenger.
I'm going to be surprised how you think NATO is about something that's stuck in the rock, we're connected, and then you're gonna defend us when it comes to the process.
Well, you're having a good time.
There's one option in the United States that they're going to cut their budget and the whole NATO is going to the bridge.
The English will exchange us for Russian silver, the Germans will exchange us for Russian silver and Polish once again show them enough to show them behind and take what they want.
The only thing that's long worked as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the citizen who is able to control the military technique of his time.
And today he is able to fly far-reaching means of every teenager, so it wouldn't happen.
We don't need border overlap, it's stupid today, but playing a teenager with a button of a remote control device is advised.
How not to be used in carcinogens
Do you fire your gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with your baskets and blankets?
This waste is again used by e-shops which lack evaporation materials.
That's why it came up with a map of the shops that you used to welcome.
And it's not just about the holidays.
All coastal materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's bad for them to act like a one-time waste.
Anyone can bring into the connected trade after agreement (KAMsNIM.cz project map contains 150 cartons, plastics or paperboards.
This supports small companies, reduces the amount of waste created and also avoids overcrowded modern containers.
Self-trading is welcomed by the banks currently lacking in the market and also by saved money, as the sea card has risen by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of environmental thinkers, I am further strengthening my brand.
One such trade is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of the eco-drug and cosmetics.
However, we are also known as companies with which we have agreed regular connections to the abandoned cartons.
We're all using a package from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies together, we create a more comprehensive world.
Our hope is to keep the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušník from Tierry.
However, the application www.KamsNIM.cz shows not only places to be taken to coastal material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to save anything (where to remove classified waste from your home, where to remove past medicines, pneumatics, power supplies, batteries, light sources, large-scale waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and they will also find their second home.
The entire map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
"In progress, it has Assembly courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise have become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the company Uklidím Česko.
I'm sure it's wrong that today's technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, the problem (mainly in the English articles) has emerged that high school students do not understand the principle of computers.
Because Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or even mobile phones usually simply hide this underlying file system with its components and all are located on one screen in the application.
It's nice to use the technique from childhood, but mostly to learn something.
Let's go over the story, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – starting in January – before the weekend – and this was huge.
Macron spoke over an hour, during which he left the presidency, called for European protection – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not reach within half a year.
French politicians like it, but they like it and they like it.
Macron supporters of the gap between rights and the left agree on a small but just for Europe.
And in France, new elections will be held in the state's capital.
The voluntary calendar has also influenced its own priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready for such a work of historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators immediately reacted to the criticism that Macron was talking about a pro-European propaganda and reexamines history.
In fact, it is more likely to prevent overwriting stories.
The final right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is currently in France with the fact that the regime of Vichy, which was co-operated with Hitler during the second world war, was not so bad and has quite a success with it in France.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one of his textbooks seriously and don't look at the work in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of our version of them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who won the battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened office, they're no longer aware of the broader context of events.
The movie is what you're doing, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that returned to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 also received an evaluation of the regime and the best heretic of Jasnu Durić.
At the annual Karlovar festival, he was standing on the first steps of the wild goat.

I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy and I'm not expected.
It was like "have a flu/be drunk" for a couple of days, and I didn't have to smoke too much...
On the contrary, it was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have any shoes in my pocket.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it.)
Night Book Types
The number of evenings to be issued on 20 December shall contain a traditional literary annex.
And there are cultural types going out with her.
We also offer you, your predecessors, this digital edition so that you will have enough time to arrange books as a gift for the evening.

The author in his previous novel will tell much less sentimental story about the return from exile than we used to hear.
Those who stayed, and those who left, knew it too little about themselves to make it out of their lives.
Trains begin to run according to a new order of traffic, where transport changes
From Sunday they start riding on the train according to a new train order.
The biggest change is the exchange of transporters on some routes, for example between Osteem over Labe and Colin, where the place of Czech dragons starts to drive RegioJet.
In most cases the line only adjusts the time of departure, if any, in a calm manner and their path.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the streets.
With the sale of the train, the transporters started in the south.
The Czech road plans to build daily on average 6783 personal transport units in the new railway line, from which to be on average 478 distant trains daily.
Trains will take place during the new railway line about 118 million miles [118 million km].
Roads along national links within the new rail line will also be traveled to Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company together with the new train line will set up tens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will drive from Prague to Cheb.
Other new transport trains are being set up in northern Moravia or in western Czech Republic.
Transporters have also traditionally increased traffic prices since the next year, with an average of 3.2 per cent.
The roads take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet's train line is R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mälník – Nymburg – Kolín.
Transporters here successfully compete in the Ministry of Transport will reward the Czech Roads.
Every day, RegioJet will be on track to set up a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes are related to the remote connections between Prague and Brne, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havličkóv Brod, Zjár vs Sazavo and Colín stations.
Leo Express kept his 16 connections, two back connections to Slovenia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emila Sedlarík, the transporter has also tried to keep the most likely travel times of his long train.
Without major changes, it should also continue to carry out the trains of Arivy and other carriers.
Transporters will also change in some regional traffic.
The changes are expected, for example, to travel to Českolipsk, where on the track from young Boleslav via Česko Lípu to Rumburk will be the place of the Czech dragons to ride Trilex German company Die Länderbahn trains.
Travelers will also be able to use single rail trains for the second year.
As with Czech expensives, their price is higher than that of inflation by 3.2 per cent.
I don't have to agree.
Don't we learn about the other side's view?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and how they had to die.
I haven't heard a study in my life from a child's perspective or from that time on, no one's afraid of it.
No one's gonna tell you at school that black people were often selling black babies themselves and that they were often the worst kids.
No one in school teaches you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, have been killed, and they've been killing each other for a long time.
For a while, I also lived in the United States, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in southern Europe.
I didn't agree that someone would deliberately hide the fact, but I've heard before that it's happening and I think it's a problem, I don't know.
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anything, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to dismiss it without looking at it from that time on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the time we're in these southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous children are quite popular there, on the other hand, and they had some good success and I've come to hate them absurdly.
Besides, Sever wasn't much better about how many people are idealizing it today.
And many people also remember that not all in Jihu were children, and a lot of things also opposed them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, they deliberately leave some facts, lie and manipulate, and we don't need to look at them (on YT there was a video on TV where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What happened to me at U.S. schools was ridiculous was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
I've quite learned that at some universities it was clear, those students were quite air-conditioned, and these schools have been supportive of it a few times.
And if I imagine these people will be a lot older once, it's a little bad for me that this could be the voice of most people because it's between young people and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism must have achieved what he had and it's not about himself anymore, it's been radiokalizing.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and lead to radicalization and on the opposite side, often leading to resistance and even to even reasonable things.
The more someone is radical, the more he's heard.
Anyway, I didn't even know that someone would condemn me for colonialism or childhood.
I must have met with a bad map, but it was weird:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's totally innocent.
I'm gonna be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition to the concept of nationality, I generally consider it to be the last of some personal identity.
If there's anything I'm going to do with people so much interest, world views and social experiences, it's not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic superstitions here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
This Slovenian hero is a very nice guy, he's got a better theory than politics, but then he's always screwing up some cokinine about koronavir that everybody's ashamed.
Then, of course, the Church of Czech Slovene is here.
They're actually Protestants, but they're actually from Catholic modern and they're actually Catholics without a paper.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the gods of the Hussites because it's theologically very similar but most members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
The church of St. Michala in Dominica is under domination, and even every Sunday at 15:00 they do Masses in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flame from Betlém is in Česk, they took it from Rakouska
Bréclav – Plamínek, blessed in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Smelling for him because of the koronavir pandemic but this time they didn't go to Vidna, they took her from their cancer mates in the morning to the Reintal – Bréclav border.
She's been transferred to the border.
Bedtime light is a beautiful holiday tradition, which we share with each other every year, I am very happy about it.
It's a privilege for me to be chosen, she told the next reporters of Amálie Budík's shooting.
While the transfer was made at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, which is right at the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Bréclav crossing at the parking lot.
It's usually for him, but he's driving the train to Vidna.
Nothing changes to the development of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the white light they used to jump traditionally into Brna, where they handed it to the 18th bishop of Vojte Cicrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, the following light is being drawn up by the cooks who will travel to selected speeds and personal trains.
The light will be transferred from them to local storage stations or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where they will no longer know it.
In this year, measures against the spread of coronavir must be maintained.
It's like a lion.
We recommend to both the curative teams, as well as the organizers of local actions, of course to wear roses, try to keep their differences, were at least, did not sing by colleagues, simply act in order to make it the most dangerous, described the speech action of the Belgian light Zuzana Hrbkov.
The tradition of Between light traveling to Europe was born in 1986 in Rakouska.
The goal is to spread along with the flame of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is for a faithful symbol of hope, a light that triumphs over darkness.
In the Czech Republic, he's been trying to shoot and shoot for more than 30 years.
The actions are based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of uncertainty and human interaction.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come to the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvello.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the economic foundations that confirm that the grant is economic bank account, but I don't think the grant would be a problem as a whole.
The development of infrastructure, the environment(e.g. water conservation), health and education these money is properly used, but I don't understand why it is given to agriculture, industry and the whole company.
As mentioned above - it produces the remaining product and acquires it free market and "the natural life of the company".
I work in the factory where there are millions of "xy-funded/co-funded" projects and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of companies that work x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company maintains and selects orders/employers for companies that can grow and be more productive after its fall
A simple agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born online will also get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think the Internet ads don't bother me, but then I'm just trying to find out that they're also affecting me - it's just so boring that it's not always going to happen to me.
For this reason I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which are currently seeking to make a simple ban on programme (= target) advertising...
It's all fiction, classical words - I'd forbid those Internets.
I'm feeling from this source has roots in (but mainly in paragraph 1):
1. "I don't believe in something most believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to say it's a critical idea."
2. "I will not believe everything they say media"
3. "I don't believe in politicians"
TVs have lost the trend of evening movies, their prime minister has two hundred this year
Los Angeles – China, television stations and broadcasting platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have lost the trend of evening films and their fans in the prime minister this year represent record more than two hundred.
He calculated it by the IMDb film database operator.
The generation of family and romantic films in recent years has increased and significantly increased the visibility of the audience, which is why these pictures are becoming increasingly popular.
This year, more than four times the year 2011 and more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those pictures that have the word Christmas (Vánoce) in its name, so it's really going to be a lot more.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas were always there.
In Česk with this period there are associated special occasions, worldwide there is also a popular need for photos at home, Love sky or classic holiday history Life has been beautiful since 1946.
But the real boom of the evening photos started until 2009, when the special film series came to the American Hallmark cable television station, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventure project called Countdown is Christmas (Recommination to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station has started to load its fans at Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 photos.
The Lifetime Competition Station has this year on the program 35 new movies with the evening theme and in general contribute to popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this turbulent period of history, it is important that there are many evening trees in the background and that they snow," wrote President Brandon Gray, author of the book of the holiday movies I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home).
"For the wonderers it's a form of immunity and a way of at least two hours to feel a little calm between all the holy madness and the madness of the world in which we have lived for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark is still using the same recipe for his films, which is quite uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with you, but then it turns out about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that is going to work out perfectly and they both fall in love.
That's what it's all about, and as long as all movies look like this and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, which does not reach the final F1 race.
At the Grand Price of Abu Kill in Form 1 there are only 19 drivers.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and won't hit the final season.
Stop Haas so send one formula.
In the last season's race, he was to be better placed in the 20th story, which he qualified.
Rus Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stand, however, will not finally reach the Grand Price of Abu Kill.
He was still positively tested on manvid-19.
This is how only 19 cars appear on the front floor, from the last story of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who is directly involved in the fight against Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is relatively fine according to the state of Haas and does not show any signs.
Nikita's physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
They are now in isolation and the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with security being a final priority for all parties involved," their representatives pointed out for formula1.com.
They don't go to Haas's recon. They can't even go.
An appropriate replacement would still have to qualify or drive in another part of the week.
I don't like the first racer with a man of 19.
At the start of the final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, the lions were positively tested by Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton.
That's why they can't shut you down.
And everyone's gonna be stolen because the boss said it.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most precious light is huge!
It's a bit like a portable clonency and its shape has been put into it for half a year and all its support.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but a little experience, at home the lights never worked too hard," Lebanon admits, who spent over 3,000 hours a year.
Hadvabi bought in Italy, 24-carat gold, not in France, and 2000 similar crystals were added by Swarowski.
The silver stars then bought 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but it's easy to add light to his height," the author commends his work, which does not yet recommend the work.
And it's got another hook.
"I'm totally on the table, I have to sell the light as soon as possible," Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he'll create a world record.
The most expensive light sold five years ago was "just" 720 000 kroner.

If so, the "Soviet fraternal assistance" can be better explained to some of our political parties and representatives.
Then people who like them would have a better understanding of what their interest is in the truth.

About the situation in the United States with the former Afro-American reporter.
In the United States, there are recent cases of police violence, this time in the context of cross-border protests.
The demonstrations that emerged after Afro-American George Floyd killed a policeman while he was arrested opened the debate on systematic racism, police work and cases of violence against the American minorities.

The government approved a shipment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could express themselves again before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have Polish colleagues to help protect the border with Belarus and build a planned plot.
Poland has officially requested NATO State aid, which is related to several months of the ongoing actions of the Belarus regime, which calls on citizens of neighbouring countries to make a false commitment to the easy crossing of the Union border.
In Poland, British and Estonian soldiers are already on their way.
Mutace Omicron expands south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking out another case of Adam's child.
“We are currently having another suspicion of this option with another child from Adam, from the preparatory class.
The direct contact with previous cases from the ZS Adamov has not been demonstrated," Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the option in our six cases – it is carried out by the national reference laboratory for flu and non-crisis viruses of the state health institution in Prague," the director said.
She added that there are two healthy sisters from one of Brno's faculty hospitals and two children one of them, two more 11-year-olds of ZZS Adamov.
There is no connection between Brna and Adam's cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have peaceful signs of four unmarked periods.
No one suspected of Omicron traveling abroad.
None of these people traveled abroad, nor did any of their families come to contact anyone who would live abroad.
Consistency with the champion in the water field is not with any of the above, Ciupek said.
The chief hygiene officer Paul Svrčina earlier indicated that an international tour was being conducted in the water pool that was in Brno a few weeks ago.
He also had players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player was ill after his return.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when he's ordering a shipment.
On Saturday, Governor California Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against goods carried out after the heart attack.
People would then have a penalty for injury to anyone who manufactures or sells explosive guns and domestically manufactured firearms in California.
Newsoma's notice responded to the fifth position of the U.S. Supreme Court, which had left a technical ban on the use of goods for almost 50 years to an old previous currency, which had established the right to use flatly throughout the United States by 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the existence of a whole law, despite the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The removal of the ban was also transferred to the public in this case, where the Czech Republicans did not allow its attack to be carried out by the ordinary court.
"I am struck by yesterday's (fifth) decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed for the maintenance of the Texas ban on most cargo services and, to a large extent, supported the manoeuvre of Texas with a view to protecting its law," said the California Governor.
"If the States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this right to protect human lives," continues News.
He believed that in cooperation with the State Parliament and the ministers of justice, he would work on measures that would justify public representatives to eliminate the ban on explosives and so-called spirit weapons.
These are marked by weapons made from weapons which have no serial numbers and which can serve as a protection against regulation.
Newsom wants them to have the right to demand at least $10,000 for damage (over $220,000) and court releases from anyone who would have produced, distributed or sold explosives, components into "aircraft" or seeds for their production in California.
"If it is the most efficient way of maintaining these terrible weapons outside our streets, creating a threat of private complaints, then we should do so exactly," said the California Governor.
The Agency submits that after ten years California has banned the production and sale of some weapons of military style, in June but the Federal Court of Justice has blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
If the State would now really prohibit the use of the Texas template, the words of the members of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, which, in a non-conformity opinion, would safeguard the fifth majority of the currency against the expansion of the legal mechanism in the other United States.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to the judicial examination to the Texas customs ban and allowed the prosecution clinics to continue their complaints against the US-elected agents.
Each emergency response has its public test phase when it comes gradually to how the vaccination scheme will look and also comes to the improvement of the vaccines itself on the basis of results.
It may have occurred from Israel in a large range of studies on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already had a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other expectation will have in time its expected scheme, it's just too fast on it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should soon be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specification, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.
The crowd teaches us to leave it quietly.
But to reevaluate what is learned.
Since the time of Marie Terezie our civilization and technology has gradually advanced and learned telephone lists and the description of students in the fields is no longer very meaningful and it is a waste of time.

I think O2's offering the League of Masters, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to suspend payment to the Union budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would argue with law if it used new powers and because of the dispute on the rule of law it would stop the payment of Poland's money.
The Commission has already deferred the approval of the Polish plan for the reduction of EUR 36 billion from the Union fund on the recovery of the economies of the covid 19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to continue to move forward and use the mechanism that enables the Union to take action against countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
" Poland should respond to this call from the EU but in all matters which require uniformity," Ziobro, the head of the small member of the Solidarity Poland, said without its votes, would come from the current government with a strong majority in Seym.
"Polska should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policies leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU is directly supporting us from the joint budget we are also contributing to by the Polish Minister.
Its approach to the EU involves a more radical existence than that of the ruling party in law and justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that have been made by the Polish Justice for Ziobrov's actions threaten its independence and underpin it to policies.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, states that "the impossible conditions are because its objective is not legal state, but the change of the government in Poland".
Warsaw is headed by "the political dictatorship carried out and is trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He pointed out that Poland should be a member of the EU which is based on the partnership of sovereign states rather than on the government of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join Brussels in such a way as to limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to have the status of the Polish colony," he declared.
But to be known in this... we in Lidla have one sort of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt I also met several times, I only needed cheese, orange, after ten minutes of milk rule, I gave up and asked myself.
They had him, it's true, in this wet sector all were chosen, less common and special, but it was between green and non-lactose zone...
If it's going to avoid, no longer in any market, no action, no gold except on site, they need no such choice, but most of them have everything I need and they have some order, so I've got ten minutes to finish.
To Lidla so I could get permission.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been monitoring how data are stored here like iron, most of the expectant responders are just a little bit more than most of the waiters.
A rational discussion of the network is taking place at a professional level, but only extreme views are available in the public area.
It's always going to the wall.
Bilateral consideration: waiting saves us, waiting is nothing.
To order everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparison of apples with roses.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But that the data collection methodology is different in these two states, no one's going to solve it.
Fuj, that's how I got it.
Sorry for your vacation and I'll give you a nice day.
As a child, I was punished with a fever.
It was never because of signs, most of it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and get sick (read instead of going to bed, slept with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never stressed without warning, Mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a wound (sometimes even after another "cracking" package just brought and put it in order to see it).
Just after I refused to listen again, I got a couple of mornings on my back (by clothes).
I personally think that physical punishments (in reasonable practice and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
It is important to me that this part of caution is given to the child in his choice of whether he will not listen and get, or whether he will be better and he will not be punished.
In the end, most of me was just being warned to start listening.

When a significant Czech lawyer and the Constitutional Judge Vojtéch Cepl answered a press question about what the Czech constitution meant for him in 1999, whether the sacred letter to which he was sworn and which he was studying at school or the agreement which may be amended if necessary, he decided to refer to the first sentence.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and change is better to pursue.
And imagine that some people even have their own rules.
As Cheši likes the evenings with grapes and green, he has voted this time on the question of the Vegetables Cepl.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing trend among lawmakers in the view that the CRC Constitution needs changes.
The year has been tested by situations in which its shape (which the Voyétés Cepl belonged) could not be predicted, for example by the direct conduct of the elected President.
But Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents shows that the political principles in their texts must be formulated.
The institution must be understood and actively protected, then it can only be the key to managing the majority of the crisis that companies face in the face of events.
The Constitution is, above all, a series of rules consisting of individual rules which are maintained by politicians.
We are afraid that there will be much abuse against minorities or individuals, so we agree with the policy.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exert their power.
Covid doesn't choose, they're fighting in the FN Brno for a few months.
Although it is known that coronavirus is more milder for children, severe cases of cases that mainly affect patients in the last few days will occur.
"We know that children are threatened and infected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Newvink's primary clinics of paediatric anesthesiology and resuscitation Faculty of Brno and Medical Colleges of the University of Masaryk, Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, easier, often running without signs.
But there are children who are with cornonavir, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need peaceful care.
This is being played at the children's infection clinic.
Very seriously sick children with coronavir are up to the last time on ARU.
Children with postcovigilant syndromes were continually separated by doctors throughout the year.
"Now it is the growth of children with acute human pneumonia, which means the flu that requires staying on the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease is absorbed by adults, both adolescents and several months of age.
In hospitals, children are also exposed to severe cancer conditions.
"At the same time, we have a child of several months and a teenager," he said.
She is pleased that no child deaths have been reported in the FN Brno Children's Hospital while in the Coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died on 6 December in the PRC.
According to Dominika, in a child hospital – not only in the koronavir department – is an integral part of psychological cooperation.
At the same time, it also warns that as with adults and children, waiting calms the process of disability and at the same time reduces postoperative syndrome.
“That’s why we recommend expectative dose applications for children,” the doctor added.
In the quiet area, you can only walk on the chosen roads.
But those quiet areas aren't so big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Usually in national parks you can walk anywhere (but not across the surface into the area).
To swim/drive in the woods outside the designated road cannot be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it doesn't look so much outside the national parks).
How's the conductor doing?
My music is in my head. Joseph Kurfirt laughs.
He's retired from a liberal opera and originally played on a forest hero.
As a singer, he can sing practically every repertoire and as a director will affect not only the librarian Divadle F. Šaldy, but also the Plzni, the Divadle Joseph Kajetan Tila.
It cooperates with philharmonic, with film philharmonic, or with a sub-coronian Symphony Orchestra.
China is raising awareness of the sanctions imposed and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is raising awareness of the sanctions imposed and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has been exposed to health and political offenses.
A few months ago Peking expressed criticism that he was unable to stop the ban that changed into a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting a zero increase in the ordered.
The Czech States, including the Czech States, are opposed to Chinese protection aid, and many Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against koronavir, for example in Italy.
How do you look at Peking?
Is it about friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of yours comes up and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?
I got it and it's nice.
The wife's happy because she's saving the grass, she's driving her car, the kids are playing with him.
Well, it's just advice.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you to the colonel.
Cameron: Well, I'm crying, it's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and what he bought complains: you love what you sold for a elephant????
He's a sleeper, he's got shit everywhere, he's got a car crash, kids are afraid of him, and his wife wants to let him grow up.
The salesman says, "You're not talking about elephants, you're not selling elephants like this...
The world's actions are dominated by great powers.
Although it pays for the equality of sovereign states, it is just the wealth that determines the course of international action.
Europe can become so rich only if it works for its integration.
This is currently at the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is headed for federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, there'll be other options and they'll take it.
It hit me too, and it's pretty possible.
I'm not an expert on the frequency, so maybe I'm a dictionary.
I'm just saying that the ellipse is mostly composed of 2 different units at the same level.
I draw an example from another commenter "Spanish measles and mandarins", when it is clear that they are afraid of Spain, where in "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I believe that the universe is known as "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are based solely on Americans.
In other words, I therefore expect it to be included in this broad concept and it is not necessary to further specify it in American forces.
But again, I just need a dictionary :D
Whether it is so or not, it's an unreasonable requirement
A five-stage earthquake occurred in Tokyo.
The Japanese metropolis Tokyo and the surrounding area took a 5.0-degree earthquake on Sunday.
The Witnesses reported that buildings in the main city had been damaged, but no damage had yet been reported.
No warning was issued before the witnesses, the Reuters Agency reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain suffered from the occult of the cosmos Milly
Today’s events show the moment when the frightened species were baptized in the western month before its unspoiled owner was afraid and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkeys also fed parks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of their actual needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwentu has now severely banned her animal behavior, informing the Sun daily.
The opium rehabilitation experts who are trying to figure out Milly after her training announced that they've never seen such a scared spaceman before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitation at the Monkey World workers in Dorset and now she is playing again peacefully with another saved baby named Moon.
A four-year-old mother admitted to two charges of causing excessive suffering to the protected animal.
In the Magistrate Court in Gwentu, she was sentenced to a 12-week sentence of deprivation of liberty with a condition for one year.
The Netherlands has also been assessed at 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a life-threatening ban on animal behavior and has to pay a total of 12 000 court fees.
The leader of the Little Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the stolen animal, Stephen Sawyer, said: "Mally's okay, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly stayed before you got used to people again.
She got baptized and hid herself before anyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement took her to the cry.
She refused to eat for a long time.
And now that she's settled down and she's alone, she can keep her eyes on new people.
Psychiatric languages from training will be performed forever, giving Sawyer.
The shooting of Milly came suddenly after the police in Gwentu revealed terrible incidents in a woman's phone after a while in her apartment because of a drug charge.
At the meetings you can hear Milly's vouchar offering.
On the next video, you can hear the Dutch oyster offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
Well, you're taking my fingers off.
In May she agreed with her partner Russell Coxe (43) to hold cocaine with her intention of selling it.
In her home she found cocaine for 1600 pounds (about 50,000 pounds) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this story three times after you're permanently crossing the 20th century?
Like you're taking the same thing first as the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killing the idea of bifling when no one, I don't care if you can or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
On the street, people are asking if to determine the nature of the square equation and coefficients.
They've all gone through it, and the absolute majority aren't even angry and they're gonna tell you they've got a drink.
So what the fuck's that learning?
I'm a big fan of general review and the reality is that people don't want and they don't need it.
And at this point it's too much and you'll never get it at all.
In part, it's learning about this lot of people who're gonna need something here.
But like, here's a note that you don't need all this facts on the machine 'cause you just don't need it.
And we'll get a little bit of it until we don't know what the score is.
(We probably share our communist past and persecution against students and elites) All the price that we will get on these machines is just high.
If reporters should be able to count, the man here would probably never have achieved these dimensions.
Wedding for the First View: Valka Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave now," Andrea answered at the Instagram in Stories on all the questions of scientific fans, which on Kadrim so insisted that she decided to end all contact and even block it from social networks.
There's been an experiment between Kadria and Andrew since the beginning.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea was moving away from her home, so at least until she returned to the Czech Republic.
But she firmly refused.
And as you can see, not only did he not end his relationship with love but he grew up in a mutual ignorance until he hated each other.
It was a planned attack from you! It was spread around Kadri in response to Andreino's charge of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's honest honesty is now out of the reach of his ex-wife, his younger sister Linda.
This brother decided to stop public.
I usually don't even express myself to this kind of thing, and we've never said too much in our family.
I don't want to make any excuses.
But when I see someone who's trying to get close to me and break the name of someone I love so much, I just don't!
I'm sorry I have to do this trip, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for his character and his help to our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I am even more sorry when I have to read such false information that are probably quite out of context.
I'd rather everybody know Kadri like me, our neighbors and our family, stand in line with Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but most importantly, that we, his family, hope for it all and know the truth and know how it really was, have added immeasurably.
The drunk thief jumped through the stage into the fifth floor.
You don't believe why.
Cchao started his underground training at a parking lot in a residential neighborhood where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, at the end of one vehicle, it was calculated as 330 kroner.
Then there was nothing better than spitting into the 5th floor and opening the window into the apartment.
There he stole two bananas.
At the end of one security camera it is then caught as it goes off the street away from the place of work and the banana goes on.
When the owner woke up early in the morning, he found out that the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
That next Chea's got it.
The man admitted he drank some alcohol on the day of the crime.
And given that he needed money, he decided to steal the opium.
The whole thing's been under investigation.
The driver ran out of stage to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandamic Act is temporarily limited and its effectiveness is linked to pandamic readiness.
When this is broken, the law won't work.
The Network Act limits the scope of the undertaking
That's not enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but never broken.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilist or foreign policy?
I think you know all that people write here.
You're just playing stupid so you're supposed to be dating someone.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerate or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic view (which was finally meant to look good).
And I don't care who believes it.
On the other hand, I don't care how much the church had in the middle of it, how much money she had saved, how much science, etc.
Not about all the wars she's been doing, for example, for thirty years.
Tl;Dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have no assembly to do
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
He survived the concrete attack.
The incredible crew survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the national health care services were saved.
The workers of the national operating centre spent an hour after Saturday afternoon calling the press with initial information on the fall of a man from the height.
Two groups of ZZS – medical and medical groups were immediately replaced.
After arriving at the hospital, it was found that a 17-year-old man had to fall out of a window of about 30 feet [12 m] high and touch his head on concrete!
In the Vitkovices, it's got coal.
But not as it should be, and they went into action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct risk of life.
The intervener intensifies his breathing pathways, ensures artificial pulmonary ventilation and, following other measures within the framework of the hospital care, her sanitistic vehicle has been transferred to another care of the Ostrava traumatological Center, informs ZZS MS country spokesman Lukaš Humpl.
I have more concerns than Coronavir from inadequate public response and authorities
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for policies and officials, first of all, to fight against fines, but above all are medical and medical personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're going to ask the military doctor, David Résacher.

Legendary Nunes after seven years of fall, Oliveira started the race
The MMA has experienced a parallel glove full of interesting results.
At UFC 269 tournaments, things are still going on.
Ousiderka Julianna Pennová has been able to defeat the legendary composer of Amanda Nunes, who has not been able to find the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't take it easy, led to Dustin Poirier's great crack and started the sand.
He also noted the victory of Kai Kara-France, who quickly installed Cody Garbrandt as technical KO in the first wheel.
He also defeated his opponent Sean O'Malley.
It's a surprise no one's expected.
This led to a women's tape of vantam weights between Amanda Nunes and Julian's Pennès.
The American entered into a mutual battle as a thought - provoking "travel", Nunes hasn't spent seven years and has brushed his teeth on another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the dueel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes has started the road for victory very actively and the opponent has even saved the push kick that sent her to the country.
The money, however, was not allowed to lead to any further mistakes and she failed to cope with the handcuffs.
The second bike was swirling and for the MMA fans, it was very tight.
Both contestants had many exceptional wounds and strong hips.
In addition to money, Nunes got to the ground where she started to scratch her.
That must have worked hard and the attack was delayed.
That's how an American prepared a huge shock when she became a new champion.
The war between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier on the title of a light bond was over.
At first, Poirier received a better gift, but the card gradually began to turn around.
Second, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to make peace with her hand.
It didn't happen to him too much, but then he created a big pressure, got a fight on his back, and slept on him a lot of morning.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round of Oliveira showed a row of shocks where Poirier was growing for a while, but then he had to turn off the crack.
The Brazilians started the title, but Poirier won two years later.
In the next game, he joined the Royal triumph of Sean O'Malley, who had already settled in the first circle on Raulian Paiv's solid right back.
Next he received a series of precisely measured strokes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to consult with Cody Garbrandt.
Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now seven years later.
That ring, or that ring?
At first glance, there's nothing complicated about it.
Most of the basic names in this section refer to only one grammatical family, so there is no problem with whether it is male, female or middle family.
Then there is also a relatively large group of basic names in which the family is not established.
Such basic names cross between two families.
Then two endpoints are obtained at the injection site and in some cases remain in the form of an unaccompanied.
For example, the word “swivel” or “coal” is a species of man and woman, first of which is derived from the pattern “mechanical” and second of the pattern “song”.
In other subgroups of essential names, different forms are already in the first place of a single number, such as ‘line/order’, ‘kedluben/pedlubne’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (for food).
Both forms are both written, they are of the same importance and are thus free of exchange.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "kurka" in Czech and "kurkek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similar to the other Czech-Morravic two words: "birth" and "birth" and "beast" etc.
Some of the words that came from other languages were originally unsolicited, but gradually they received Czech conglomerates.
A typical example is the term “image”, which is the type of man and woman, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle of the family uninhibited, but has ends according to the pattern “gard”.
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation appear directly at Greek borders?
The Greek-Turkey border is under pressure because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people at the southern border of the Schengen area began to appear after Ankara stopped defending them.
European policies promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid also comes from the Czech government.

False charges have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written about everyone.
It is unacceptable for people to solve how sexual violence appears in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to talk about it.
I don't know anyone personally who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how often these people are treated by their environment or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has been that victims finally open up their traumatized.
It's still going on, but as long as people leave it for themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's jealousy and flirting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "most of the charges are deliberate" and that it's "trend" you only help sexual offenders.
Czechs sail the scattered houses, families don't have money to finish
The cost of construction materials has increased by more than 30 per cent in the last weeks and months.
A number of people are getting into a moody situation.
However, there is no means of completing abandoned family houses and banks refuse to raise mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to end up in abandoned homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgages, which create extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into isolated and unequipped homes.
In the worst case, the houses are deserted and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and still pay rent," says the BHS Econom BHS Štépán Kreček.
We're going to build two or three family houses a year, and we're going to have 50 percent of that.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult to keep some things in agreement even though the material has been confiscated.
So we're doing without training," said the owner of the construction company Zdenjek Sliven.
There'll be financial problems for the first time.
If they're counting on the house building going out to five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
From the material, she was most impressed by the honey, iron and also by the installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, but they also struggle with a lack of labour force.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates of state-of-the-art committees and the lack of foreign workers is a pandemic.
The most favourable situation is currently only with regard to the issue of a building permit.
"In October 7,675 construction permits were issued by the building authorities, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Greece explained.
We're gonna be fine and we're gonna have more.
Real vision, but it's missing, says CRO – MujRozhlas
The entry into the new year in addition to classical celebrations have already traditionally been carried out.
In addition to Prime Minister and President of the United Nations, Andrej Babish and President Miloš Zeman and President of the Senate and the Parliamentary Chamber of Commerce spoke to the people this year.
What did we find out?
As I get a super diploma right, I have my own theme I've chosen, I've always been doing this all year long, and then I've got two pieces of writing in a week.
The states are totally at ease with us if there's no human total cat and something left in his head, so this commission won't be too interested in the theory.
I must have been taught at the station a week ago, and when I was at the end, the Commission always tried to point me to some logical drive that I just got along and I had the right one.
On the other hand, I know people who pay someone to do this semi-annual project (we have done it many times, really profitable, much learning) and then only learn this project and have it grown.
I think it's great when at the end of the article there's a test to which the knowledge gained within the project is not just a challenge.
But don't pick up your e-mails and your phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same guy as them.
Those people on the embassy have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they might have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can calm down next to Pú's bear soda soda.
You still need to give it to Xi Jinping on the back or something.
I agree, even though the Insta is hazing artists under her feet.
As long as you don't have stories every day and at least every second day of the new picture, your records will be reduced to a simple minimum.
In addition, the forum changes which is more important for function, whether it is short, comment or storage.
I'm really scared of this lately series, so maybe I'm going to have to get down to the point where many artists from my industry are successful and don't let them do it.
Finally, I might also like if there's something we can use to do that doesn't come from artists of all creativity and energy.
Declaration of the Parties working on the Danube
In fact – yes, breaking – no – they express their view on the photo of the SSR outbreak.
Thirty years after the illegal breakup of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškević signed the agreement that "the Soviet Union as an international legal entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist" in Belarus without any legal authority or violation of the results of the referendum on 17 March 1991.
In one caveyard, almost three million people have been "crazed" by an earthquake.
The fall of the SSSR has affected tens of millions of Russian ethnic citizens abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has decreased by between 10 and 11 million.
And despite the loss of the non-Russian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars!
In the past, the same people who destroyed what had been established over the past seven decades have made a socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the second world war and in the Great War of Owning).
The deindustrializations, the shocks of agriculture, the withdrawal of the world’s largest strength from the fourteenth republics which were previously economically linked to the single mechanism.
If we want to look further, then we see the deterioration of the population, the breakdown of the economy, the sciences, the armies, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in post-Swiss space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO in the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitalism, the emergence of the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum force".
All that was quickly discovered and released was quickly completed and received NATO countries that adopted our geopolitical capital.
And the whole world is still devastated mainly by events since the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with large turnover must not be directly aligned with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some mass in the supermarket worth 189 Kč / kg.
I'll buy it by giving it to the fridge and do it on Thursday night.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy this mass on Monday, it's going to fall to 99 Kč / kg in the afternoon - would you describe the mechanism that will change its price from that mass to become a client for my system?
And I'll wait until Thursday and this mass will be 1 day before the consumption date is reduced to 69 Kč / kg - what would this mass be different from what I bought on Monday about 120 Kč expensive and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These cookies about that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed that it is wrong, proven or inefficient to be terribly delayed to tell you the truth;-)
I've recently gone to Brná on Hlavas, and in the course of the ladies, I'm always taking something like this to help the Brigadiers, they can't...
Well, the brochure was full of rural understanding and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some sort of a joke.
After reading it, I found out who published it and finally came out of science.
Well, as a good master, full of all the other lessons, like I have to be and not be a pizza.
The damage to paper, which would make it impossible for waste to be eaten.
Something like that I've been living with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychiatric manipulation and emotional expression will bring you out to this person because you like him without knowing how much in the p*part of this situation is.
Sometimes she threatened to hurt me because I went out with a friend who didn't like to hang out.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment before she broke up and asked me not to eat anywhere on her knees.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It's been a great relationship for about a year, but then he ran for another half year and started shooting at her.
Then I ended that relationship with what I told her I was breaking up with her, but I can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not get any more trouble.
Such a person among you promotes feelings, emotions, and total joy.
It's better to keep going.
If they're really stealing insurance by buying the dark of tests and he's on positive ones who wouldn't know about that terrible failure.
The only thing we can achieve is the complexity for companies, transporters and others, because their employees in the generator of emergency numbers fell five days of domestic detention.
In the background, they have already stopped this scarf and realized that it is not worth solving the disease worse than the famous flu.
Unfortunately Válek is new and has to grow something else and raise himself ego by thinking of drilling.
I see we're back with an old good smile.
After several years of withdrawal and withdrawal of this small business, the MLM recruiting returns to the auction.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first on the VS), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care about it, mostly people."
I was directly interested in the products I offered, since I wanted to help people, yet training was more than human fear and anxiety.
When the first money came, the person quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to make a few specific products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only ones that were excellent, and then man felt like a domestic wholesaler.
But I can say, experience has been valuable, man has learned that he must not jump to every mistake and information to check thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't get everyone into one pit.
People in this business are successful and even successful, but they will certainly not be admired by expensive goods or "curious" account.
In the corporation where I'm doing a lot of things like this I haven't experienced.
HR's calm, the manager's looking for his management and we're not getting too close to anything.
However, a regular assessment is taking place in a kind of way that is quite going on with us (to set some goals for another year, we look at what happened and what didn't) - it's more self-esteem than someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company action is not mandatory either.
But we're also a little different from our companies - they're divisions that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a quark-starter that's squatting in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so much that they don't bother us until they're the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days after the missing 32-year-old Czech police disappeared in late November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that a woman from Uherskohradištska had been found dead.
The British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that she had found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we're not going to send more information in case.
The real deal, he put on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman last saw on November 28 on a bus on her way out of work, and she had to raise money from the bank.
Her disappearances were reported by colleagues at work five days later.
The next time the London police started patroling her, Interpol ordered her to be among the wrong people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police had already arrested one man a few days ago in this connection.
What he was supposed to do was play a role and what he suspects, but she didn't.
At the end of the year, in four municipalities, new representations were made.
On Saturday 11 December, in the municipalities of Komna at Uherskohradíšk, Lužice at Mosteck, New Ves at Libereck and Rovná at Pelhřimovsk, new representatives were invited to attend.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has been covered by the number laid down by the law or by the number of representatives selected here.
Of the 28 missions, 99 candidates were present in the new elections.
The voluntary share reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the town of Equal, where 93.62 % of eligible voters were selected.
The mission has reached a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new election to represent these four municipalities.
Of the 28 representative posts, 36 women and 63 men were present.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us is symbolic of a relatively generous but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections have taken place in general representatives, and in particular very closely followed elections in the House of Lords.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in more favourable epidemiical conditions, which included higher benefits for equipment and personal security, according to Eva Krump, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The final voting period was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hours.
On Monday the results of the vote will be published by a single State Electoral Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Assembly of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It's been a while since we've had a completely dangerous infectious disease here, but it's gone without any major seizures.
To deal with how idiots put a large part of the population on all its species, I have a problem with that right now.
I'll finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not cheap.
He would be exempt from the role of the President and the ability to recover it again.
The chance that it really comes to this is how the others here mention very little.
In addition, I'm not sure if the carded record would even be considered a veneer.
Vézrada is such a action as the President of the Republic threatens the objectivity, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How pandemic Affects intimate life: Growing numbers of people up to 35 years of age who are without sex throughout the year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
It's mainly about religious people based on the DailyMail website.
The study showed that from 2008 to 2021, 35 young people who claim to be sexually active grew from 8 per cent to 21 per cent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age who said that she had no sex in the last year is more than she used to.
To reduce the number of sexually active individuals, there are other factors, he showed the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the Coronavir pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
The approach could, however, also include the presence of media, social networks or videos that make for young people less and less focus on sex.
"From 2010 men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 grew rapidly, who claimed that they had no sex in the past year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, only 5% of them reported having been without sex in the last year of 2021.
In free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage is only a small percentage at the age of 35.
Then there is fear of the premise and religious foundations of sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of women and adolescents under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people share their view on premarital sex, about 30% of it is wrong, while almost 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minority, but their conduct is this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex are due to religious foundations.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 per cent to almost 60 per cent in people under 35 years of age who attended religious meetings for more than one month.
The trend among "less believers" rose from 10 to 20 %," Stone declared.
There are also other factors that contribute to the breakdown of sexual activities, such as less social interaction and mainly alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower in people without work or less income.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media that apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online than they “repudiate this need”.
This trend was captured mainly by the lockdown during the Kronavir pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against humans is whether the company should impose a portion of the population to conduct which they do not want but which can save their lives.
This is a relatively difficult question, which I am most interested in in the issue of social consciousness.
For example, if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be able to escape the death of an eight-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, heard some misinformation, and, as a result, didn't expect it, and finally took it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can escape the death of a closed requisition that lies behind the SPD and the KSCH are covering something about the current and total state.
From these statistics I have mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unexpected pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Chechnya with no snow.
How does the peaceful winter sign the fear of drought?
The annual winter has already brought one of the least snowy hints in the Czech Republic over the past few years.
Operators of liqueur areas will not be affected without technical snow, and time will also be complicated by the preparation of the Hizer Falls.
It's a trend or an exception?
And what's going to mean a little snow for fighting drought in Chechnya?
I should have one story, but it's not about a pancake.
One by one, our middle teacher took us across the city on the boat so that we could design the boats along the river.
On our way there we went one such wide street, and we don't see anyone in the middle - stoppers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they slept on us.
I ran out of luck, but with one of my friends, they gave me a word.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul first.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teachers, were tired all the way to the boat.
We're a terrible disappointment.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system's getting worse, says Orozovic.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawecki with military gifts.
"We are opening up a new chapter on mutual relations," Morawicki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
The school stressed that Europe must jointly state that it will not accept the deterioration of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops in Ukraine's borders, according to the office, is a Western solution to the use of diplomatic arrangements, including within the "Normandian Group", which combines France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawicki said that the office had informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukašenko, had been able to call for a migration crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, because we record the percentage of attempts on (unlawful) crossing the border every night.
He spoke with the Chancellor about other sanctions so that Lukaschenk's regime and his patronage in Kremlin would finally understand that we decided to protect the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, the school made sure that Warsaw enjoyed German support in dispute with Belarus and condemned the Dutch conduct of Lukašenk's regime with refugees.
A drunk Polish waitress has caused an accident. She's trying to keep it.
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, however, the car was already driving another jeptic who tried to take the blame on himself.
When the police told her that she could get a driver's license from the accident after a week of driving and arrest, she went out with the truth, TVN24 pointed out.
She admitted that she had a different pocket in her car, which she asked for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestin.
She was subjected to breathing tests and after finding out that she had more than two drops in her blood, she was immediately taken with her driver’s license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be told in court by her actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shaymovic, but he didn't watch his movie.
Frequent family comedys were seen in American dog stories.
But they forgot about the main thing: the legality of the film show.
After the film F. Brabce Gump - dog that has taught people to live, there is now another picture here we are looking at.
Spolluator of the scene and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. is free to watch his previous film here I have been watching since 2012.
The scene is back with the talker Hugo and some famous positions around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension that's comin', and so they start calling him a singer, Julie's father and her partner and her daughter Veronica.
She's no longer a little girl, but she's a very exciting girl who's living in love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovic (which is also a producer film) dealt with the way the film was handled in the previous dog, but at least children and dogs were there.
This time she wrote a two-fold even worse scenario, which triggers a mixture of surprises and feelings of suffering.
Let's get this together.
Julie, whether scientificly based on a baby's birth in the dark blues and if she comes to the right "constellar", competes with her forest engineer Ivan, where the co-operative is right – at the head of a car or a church bed (of course during a local tour with a guide), served by Colonel Mojmir despite flying training, who falls into the woods of his own daughter (Julie), who is a family chosen hospital to play a miraculous healing process in the heart of the village alone.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the strength of pets.
Their owners know why they have it.
The wonder, however, is what the content of the whole disparaging situation and the figure needed for this message.
Two staff offenders, fishing competition, the forest Charlotte, police coming to search for "drugs" and discussing the evidence of the heavy force of bone marrow – which is obviously drunk by a family in the pension.
When a pregnant woman is breast-feeding after a severe coma and breast-feeding is forced into a cigarette at the family table and breast-feeding her father’s whiskeys and flakes are treated by a vegetarian can be avoided.
The proposal further explains to the Divak shape that "it sometimes happens after the stone".
Shajmovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of work with text, ability to expose the situation of the nose, feeling for the character of the position and point and governance.
The Greek executions are uneven, the tears of joy and the whole mind are inflamed.
Whether Lukáš Vaculiík, Jitka Jjök or Nela Boudov are trying to get up their parties, they have nothing to play.
The only stage of the film remains the poetic collections of the wild nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomka and two of the hostages.
It is not enough to plan a few posts, a chat room and dog voices, since more human vulnerabilities are allowed.
The argument is that there is no flight membership in the Beekeepers' Club - as in the case of women producers.
The idea of promoting nature and human friendship must also be a matter of reason if one wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
A good family picture is here a little too erotic and a minimum quote for the genre.
Not even as a canstery commercial, this amateur-goose shirt wouldn't go through.
Yeah, respect, 'cause they have to listen to persistent demands just like you are.
It's the difference between the offer and the push, it's here to see how you understand it shit, but it's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always on customers, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you've been listening to a furthest thing like this, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like everyone else, in which case it's a brigade.
The near east beats the dry moon.
At the same time, the winter is the only period in the year when it comes.
"The complete absence of strikes during November, as we have noted at some stations, is unusual," Israel's meteorological service confirms.
For example, the Kfar Gilead district in northern Israel reports only six per cent of the long-term battle rate in November.
The double rain from this week was therefore more exceptional.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been here a long time.
It's also this right Christmas dress, the Nazaret's citizen Wassim Askar was pleased.
The droughts in Israel occur exclusively in winter months, are noticeable and irregular.
The winter rain is dependent on forests.
Without them they will beg and are driven to the flames.
It's not only about forests but also about the resources of drinking water and land for farmers.
The largest sugarcane source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was flooded this year by the last three rains.
Since then, the ice has been freezing.
Water operators have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there can be a conflict here," in 2018 Israel's water economy agency Uri Schor proposed.
Israel is able to assist technologies such as cooling or recycling of waste water.
They're up on the low economy, such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tanks.
Water and private baths are still breathing.
"In this year, orders of between 70 and 80 per cent were issued to me in comparison with two years ago," said Imad Suleyman in the seat of the tanker driver.
In the Iranian Isfahan, fires broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The short local river seemed completely waterless.
The region has its most recent November in recent years.
Israel is preparing a military coup against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister announced that the meeting in Vienna had not resulted in "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on the Iranian nuclear plant.
Minister Benny Ganttz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack against Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to express their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference at Florida, Gantz said the nuclear conference in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "know that the Iranians are playing with them".
It happened to me about three years ago.
I picked up the lady a little bit and waited for her to find out what she really wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these subfuges, so for a while I've raised doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Please tell me I've played, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
The lies about the weekend went up to the mountain, waiting for enough snow and good weather.
The Česka centre has experienced this week’s first major effort on lying.
After the discharge at the end of the working week, there is no snow and some skierials have begun to operate.
The witnesses did not even have the obligation to prove themselves on the streets with human certificate.
While doctors are not complaining about customers' interest, some of the loanable laser equipment reports a worse demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberian country went to the racetracks and on Saturdays.
There was a time for liars who offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We're calm, this starting weekend has really gone out of the Friday evening lie when we had the first skirmish," said the director of the Sports Area Ještéd Jacob Hanus.
Hundreds of people also appeared after the first weekend lie in the new season.
They were open, for example, Sky Arén Karlov or a middle school in Branné on Schumpersk.
The weekend’s visit was very good, and today 400 people came home on Saturday.
The conditions are simple.
Today the sun shined, there were about three degrees less than three degrees, so perfect, the glorious representative of the skirmish center in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skier drivers can only sell crews to people who are expected or are in the process of spreading the disease to 19 people.
When people are prepared for exceptions and show the necessary evidence, ČTK René Hronès from the Schpindler Mlyn ski center said.
"We've only exchanged units of incidents," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some loans and sales of laser equipment.
The interest in borrowing lies with luck.
It's not like in the last years, but it's still a lot of customers, Alexandra Bokiš of the Oppa sales company Skiopov.
Greater effort is expected during the skiing courses.
Also, the director of the Royal Snowbear company David Shinták feels that because of the loss of the loan, he is not as interested as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost off-line.
On the other hand, we're about 50 percent before the pandemic, said CTK Shinták.
According to him, people broke up with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the big question is about rent in the Novako area at God’s Daru.
With the rent they started there a week ago, and the interested parties must now order them in advance.
"We start renting this weekend, but people have already called before, so we expect a great deal of interest, like a lion," said Paulín Novak's area operator.
An interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also considered to be a laser school.
If we want success and wealth not to go to a foreign country, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life as in a foreign country.
Of course, there is no socialist medicine where dentists or specialist doctors are not often able to obtain it.
It's going to the border, smart and chubby people who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company's foreign business just doesn't go that far.
I'm sorry, but you're just agreeing.
If these people will not live well in the PRC and if these people will not have a reasonable future in the PRC, then they will not live in the PRC.
Migration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one beautiful day, the year he ruled, and suddenly the annual migration took place about a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the CRA can't get in a similar position from day to day.
Other questions are even choice.
If the fool lives here, he can win some traditional V4 crazy.
Young people and education will leave, his supporters will remain and people whose assets will not be spent on the plane.
A picture of the day!
Longmayer in blood because of beer sauce?
While in Česk was in full subjugation, in Thailand the film scene of the Island in front of Jiři Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical times!
In addition to social networks, Herec published a blood photo of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it about getting hurt?
The London police are still chasing the innocent Chechnya.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petry is not like her behavior at all and we start to be very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srnc worked on Saturday.
" Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and wants to know soon where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman said on Sunday, November 28, at 19:45, she left her job and headed home to the fourth Chamberwell.
The last one was probably seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her employees.
Srnc's health nurse, according to the British media, has been acting as a “health assistant” at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital.
"We have irreconcilable concerns about our dear colleague, Peter, who is unconscious," said the twitter contribution of a group of medical devices.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find her to contact the police," continued the announcement.
The public is also calling on the delegation of Harriet Harman, who warned Srnc in the case of the press conference on Saturday.
"It's a few days ago, it's only 32 years old, it's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandable to the death of old age," said a labist politician, who held in her hand a photo of women distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her family country, away from family and working here for our health," said Harman.
In the past, the police had already arrested a man who remained in custody.
According to the BBC web report, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine like this either.
It's not a "overload," but about 8 percent of Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine continues to lament that the threat of Invasation is increasing and it begins to have our full teeth in it.
I was quoting up.
I don't know why you're upset about the Russian war.
Valka is a hell of a pleasure and Russia has a HDP Italy.
Compared to the situation in the year 38, I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the first Punish war and "anixes" silk :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not willing to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia is antagonizing the mixed republics.
That's all, and that's what this "concentration" on the border would do.
Ono, the treaty is serving...
In Prague since Sunday there are new traffic lines, mainly affected by direct connections
Traveling in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) has been waiting for several changes which are particularly related to direct connections.
There were new lines, some changed the path, and others disappeared.
The integrated system is reintroduced into Mladoboleslavska.
In the main city since Sunday, they stop fast from the Czech Budějovic in the garden City station.
In the direct train transport, S7 trains travel on the road from Berouan to the Czech bridge through the main port of Prague.
In the recently renovated Prague-Zachardní City station, R17 will be stopped again from the Czech Budějovic and Benešov.
The PID will expand to other areas.
Besides, the buses will go to the Light of Sázava, Blatna of Jesenice, Old Slavs and Turnova.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslavsk, including a line moving to the country of Liberia and the Kingdom.
77 lines will be broken when integrated, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 functioning operations will be managed.
A new bus line 405 goes from Prague to Zilčina, which goes to Žatce.
There was also a new direct connection between Praha – Kralovice u Rakovnika, which replaces the broken train line S53.
They will be sent to the early hospital and on the weekend connect from Prague to the branch, when the express line number 404 is new.
New lines 400 and 410 travel to Liberia are included in the PID system.
They're coming out of the metro station of Stryzkov, not from the Náraží Holešovice station.
The fifth line 400 goes through Mälník, Duboa and Česko Lipu to New Bore and the selected links continue to Rumburg or Cvicova.
Additional line 410 goes through Melník and Duboa to Docs, Mimón and Jablonní in the Library.
On the other hand, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on 10 medium-term local routes, including Mochov, Dobřèše or Rozmitál under Trimšina.
All the train leaving Prague was canceled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the tracks of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Colin.
Changes are expected to take place in other places as well.
The buses replace some broken rail lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobřèše with a commitment from Prague, where it is possible to use the PID trains to Milevska.
The change took place between 540 and 543 lines in Nymburg and some buses on the border between the Czech and Horóvicka in the Republic of Plzeńsk.
Healthy lunch/food to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute stop and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a kiss next to Lidla.
Because I don't have any movement, I don't have the power to exercise after work, so I have to eat the most healthy and diety.
I'm sorry I never know what to buy and I'm going to buy the most pizza on earth and for every yogurt and apple.
Question: what health care without the need for heat adjustments would you recommend me buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so I'm sorry.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only a piece of wood can be covered under the snow.
If it ends, the tree can become more prone to hip disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they're ordering us to drive out of the seats, but it's one of them.
Recognition of Dary's relationship with Negro: I didn't enjoy this at all
A five-year-old Czech commercial fisherman does nothing but discover the relationship between Dary Rollins and Paul Newvid.
They've been taking it away for years, a famous footballer has even let it grow because of the singer.
He now sends a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why he loves them for a long time.
"I allow myself to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovenia who would have prevented Dara from catching the bear, so sorry, Newida," Dara Rollins, who is among the most successful Czech footballer loved to the ear.
But he took her away, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are generally interested in the public, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we didn't both enjoy, but we knew that one day the singer was coming.
I just don't know who's up there.
If those who don't even care about it and pull it out of their store, or we're asking their lives in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you were dating a husband or a friend enough, or you were stuck to it so that everyone would really know about the list of your former partners and be aware of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's fun, you want it, Darre.
The two gave together in Italy, where Rollins traveled because I was preparing my new fashion collection.
I don't know how long it's going to take as Vice President of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth to this day because they were waiting for Negro's divorce to end.
Ivana’s wife had been a divorce for three years, and the paper was not her own but for just three weeks.
Whatever happens to those who are happy with us and are willing to give it to us, we are grateful.
And we're just people, we have families, children, history and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband and just like him with me, I stand with him.
Hey, the other commentators already said almost everything essential, I'm just confirming that the wheels are super to begin with, my colleagues met most of the time during the first season or two and looked up and then found themselves together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Most of the apartments don't work too long before, so you probably don't find it very much now, but looking at the offer definitely doesn't hurt.
On the other hand, not only does it avoid Cel, but it is also around (the streets like Vranovská, France etc., it's quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jewish are a bit of a ghetto.
On the contrary, the fourth Vevere is a very student, the King's field and this direction is good, but it's close to most VUT college (I don't know where you're going).
So I never missed a rent, but I'm a cousin of Brnák, so I can probably consult Brn as such if you're missing any more information :)
But that's an example of a "normal" attitude.
Because of what has been decided to do to a few doctors in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not finance enough schools.
Let them learn what they want and pay for it or go according to the state and pay for it.
However, we cannot let a private actor rule the school course simply because there are a few crowns coming to its full state contribution and it will be able to learn what it wants in schools.
Such a claim is sometimes lost when written by a person who said two days ago about a petition for a coup d'état of a total state:
So the vote against if someone goes on the road is the same for you as the vote against getting some soda on the spot?
I'd like to consult you directly with the man who assigned you this job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in catalogue/digitalization that (and this is a long professional) it's kind of eye-opening or they write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (by the convention) and in the notice that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd like to sort out something in your note according to what program you're using.
If you want to be a good and powerful student, you can look into some of the character databases and look for the nearest.
But because it looks like you're getting out of some book, so I'd just type out that the author or the printer simply created his own sign, which is based on what's physical on that coin.
PS: Isn't this a way to get rid of the redhead (kingdom) than the redhead?
PSS: Someone's already solved it here.

Politicians don't even know what's going to be "the subject" of our presidency.
It's a lot worse than they'll have pressure.
I guess they'd say something because no one understood any text, it's funny.
All important approved documents are examined in words, and there is no basic knowledge of English, which is the subject of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and press translators are working, English is becoming more popular with politicians for informal contacts, and over-standard relations are being established.
In addition to this English, it is quite interesting after the EU's GB is released.
I don't get that hate on Ciel.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm totally fine.
How many times I'm out of work at 10 o'clock and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't been there for a while.
Yeah, most of the Roma people live there, but the only thing they do is they stop on the walker and park where they don't have:D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out there tonight on the street.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the center, I'd just go to it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly constructed.
Felix Slováček (78) without Father's love Gelem's as a ring in the plate!
Who's going to spend Christmas with?
On Sunday most people at the Advent wedding burned their first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I don't have an adventurous wedding, so there's nothing to burn.
I've seen her last night, and Lucie must have had some of her own, said Blesk, a saxophonist who so confirmed Patras's words that she often visited her.
She's visiting, but she's not staying in their home at Vinohradech, where Dad is staying alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where it's gonna be on Saturday night.
We recently met Anička, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we've always said something, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying presents, and Dad and Lucie I'm going to buy something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman. I'm a gentleman. I've added Felix, who's been baptized in a music video clip at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel myself.
I always find someone I like to play with, says the Slováček who was glad to meet the wife of Ludjka Soboty Adrian or the singer Kamil Nivlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford to have no soldiers and weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a simple idiot so he doesn't have this land.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so you explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be found in the hospital crisis.
Police are few and cannot afford to do so, just as a driver and nowhere else is such a high percentage of healthy trained people.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava so soon goes to the head of the previous government, not the army, this request for new players has been long enough.
Record dry in the PRC.
It's necessary to change the agricultural contribution, the country won't just be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, water was killed in the mountainous and subtropical areas, less wells of sand also mark areas where there was no need for electricity.
The causes of drought, which is prevalent in much of Central Europe, are climate change.
But the impact is also strengthening the way we manage the soil.
What do I need to prepare for?
And how can we help nature in times of distress?
Yeah, well, I'll just stick around in my chests on the ice, I'd better know what it's like to play hockey and this tactic (which I've experienced in French hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you're a hockey team "invest Russia" or "in China" you're going to lose on two balls, and even if you don't have to win for each game at all costs, it's different than when compared.
But as I listen to Czech commentators who say what decision-makers don't care whether they're already male or female hockeys, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian heroes" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the wrong thing to do, it's like it's always like it's always been, and that already Chechnya and Russia have won more than it's won, it's probably a classic "voice has won" all the "MY we've won".
Coronavirus: The number of orders in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic registered 9080 daily orders.
There are 5766 people in the hospital.
All died in the PRC 34 451 people, 74 others.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100 000, 871 per 100,000 per last week in 1967.
The number of orders in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new orders were registered.
It's the lowest daily number since 13 October.
The total number of registered orders in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of days of death is 1132, it's the lowest number of days since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "extraordinary" large wave of order caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on television by Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical consultant for the British Health Agency.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
The people infected with micron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died on the micron before, but about fourteen days after vaccination and about three weeks after death.
The head of British labs Keir Starmer found on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by the fact that the lions were taken down in December when they were taken down and they were banned for dinner parties, arranged at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government claimed that the vote was "virtually" over the computer.
He was all involved in the Downing Street team of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure to remove Johnson from primary function.
During the London December, when a hard lockdown was held in London and the evening parties were banned, Johnson's ministers arranged to read the lockdown.
The British public and the media claim that Johnson and his government were making jokes:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Two years ago Boris Johnson won a tree in most of the general elections.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the prime minister's office.
It's amazing how fast things got going.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for a wave of elections that can end the 12-year-old government of Victor Orbán.
This will be the will of the European Union as a whole.
How much can you expect the fairies to be?
They won't be fair.
They'll probably not even be free because they weren't even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fides controls the media, changes the limits of the electoral circles to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
It's the last one that makes it possible for anyone to vote in practice wherever he wants.
This enables Fides to consider voters from the decided circles into those where the outcome is uncertain and opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be at all.
Do you think this will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is very different.
It was about whether Fidesh won, but how much and whether he'd have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by united opposition.
It's a big draw for Victor Orbán and his side.
They won't be able to hold much more hard to play?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go for what they did yesterday.
She recently withdrew from the independent media record of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fides László Kövere, where the Heads of Secret Services report that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, it's one of those newspapers.
It all starts in the language.
I've been bitten almost often, last time at 14, Mom's mother has not had too much patience, neither am I, her dad has a long time, but then she's extremely bunchy (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very cholera, and I ran away like a little scary, to the point that I was lying on the ground in my throat and was all blue, so I took 2x under my armpit to relax.
I used to dance well at times. Sometimes it was like they didn't know.
I'm sure I'm also going to try to solve things by violence as little as I almost did, now to throw myself into something stupid, and as a youth I need my parents so crying over their hands (that I don't get too much over my shoulder), so I never get anything extreme, but I always have it.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my will, but of course this training has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children too, and I'm going to solve it the same way.
I think having kids is just bad and that my parents shouldn't do it, especially not at the moment when it wasn't "high," but from frustration, on the other hand, almost every parent is just being worried, maybe it's not possible for their children to do it a little bit, so I don't read it to them.
I don't know why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and uniform.
So I'd like to call them customers who make laws like that.
Otherwise, I'd be interested if you weren't afraid of the loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you're going to have to pay for what mortgage?
It's a crazy world.
Where's Slovensk taking the process with the murder of journalist Kuciaka?
In Slovakia, the main proceedings are initiated with four complaints of the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírov.
The death of the investigating reporter and his partners changed Slovenia.
She also abandoned the practices of the accused company Mariana Kočner and its involvement in Slovenian politics and justice.
What is the main crime that will be meant by the procedure for Slovenia?
This is what journalists can do.
How is it possible that this petition had a lot more media attention than the counterattacks of all the medical colleges that went out during the day, two later?
By the way, they let themselves be confused, and the company got away with it.
On Czech television she died with a man six years ago.
Another government ends up and the citizen's law to join in the election of a post is nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlička needs to be processed in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babishe is at last bound by law that should ensure respect for the interests of the citizens and their citizens when selecting and permitting a high level of radioactive waste.
The Governing Council of the Government has suspended the submission of a proposal submitted by the Government after flight to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
However, its content is in serious dispute not only with the affected citizens associated with the platform against the deep position, but also with the Soviet City and the Czech Republic.
Self-defences from the law are expected to strengthen their chances of making a decision on the role of the elderly as of 2011, when the first work on this legislation has begun and requires the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its joint contract proposal, will be processed in cooperation with the citizens.
The proposal of law by Minister Karl Havlička, who has the Platform available, concerns citizens in particular: The proposed objective of involving citizens and the public in the decision-making process on the location selection process is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the citizens and their citizens.
In fact, it can only be effective if citizens or the public can influence whether the process is going to continue in the given location.
This may ensure that the responsibilities of the Management Board are exercised prior to the initiation of a specific procedure for the consent of the citizens concerned.
The proposed proposal for a permanent purpose almost completely forgets the involvement of the public and makes it possible for citizens to practice statistics only during the recruitment proceedings.
The proposal lacks system-wide compensation for citizens for the entire process of search and selection of location for the location, permission and operation.
Representatives of municipalities actually do not have too much opportunity to appeal to the interests of their citizens when looking for a place to invest.
However, only in certain appeals may make their comments or withdraw, it shall be decided by the authority or minister in whose interest it is authorised to issue.
Where applicable, the application shall not have a proper effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The principle of self-determination required by the Platform is often used in many democraticly developed countries and then decidedly in those who have already advanced in the authorisation of the position, such as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another violation of the State administration, which hires an external law office to prepare legislation.
In this case, there is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which has been concluded by SURRAO and is linked to a contract with lawyer Jan Germany.
The total amount for these jobs is 4 million koruna according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the city of Cële from the locality Hådek and speaking Platforms against the deep position, said: After the ministers of industry who compared the situation of self-regulation against state authorities in the search of a high-level position of radioactive waste, we are waiting for a new government to make a more significant statement.
We're offering this and a helping hand.
We are also grateful for the support of the Svaza City and Citizens who take into account the problem of urban rights in such basic buildings as those directly concerned in the selected premises.
The platform against deep investment shall be composed of 51 members (35 cities and cities and 16 groups) with a view to extending the state's approach to control over fuelled nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste which will not be limited to a deep investment.
The platform further seeks that the decision on localisation should be subject to prior consent by the municipalities concerned.
Herce Johna Goodmana (69) donutil for fear loss: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change for a long time in his life - style, he was eventually threatened by doctors.
They told him he wouldn't die if he didn't.
And that's what it took.
Goodman gradually agreed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight 180 kg, informs The Sun daily.
His new post was held in Los Angeles at the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There's a completely different person from the little Roseanne satin!
John was happy to see his friends and family ask him to lose because his big body had caused him to lose his mind.
"I threw everything into my mouth," said the herec in 2018 in a discussion for AARP.

It also depends on what boss you are and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If there's any text on the platform that's expecting the reader from the nice environment, I wouldn't tell you.
If it's about formal text and it's about high school, I'd probably be looking for a way to describe or explain.
There are many kinds of bosses for everything.
Maybe a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses that yes, and so "boss" is something like a master/ ruler given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who don't have to win to finish the game or level, but often they are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then there's a game like Half-Life where the bosses are, but the player is not straight with them (Tentacle, Gargantua) and can they even be called?
Well, then they're mini-bossed.
It's basically one way to translate boss just doesn't go, it doesn't work, it doesn't solve it in any way (it's just interesting it's only Catalan that it translates as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game that is generally important, computer-controlled, more powerful than all previous and watching the completion of some level or task.
After Peter's missing from London, the world's fifth.
The Czech police also started.
After Peter Srnc's missing five British police since December 3rd.
The Czech police also started looking.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradíška is looking for December 7th.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
The Czech Peter Srnc saw her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been following her since December 3rd.
Interpol gave her a so-called yellow trainer.
So after Peter, there's five of them all around the world.
"The Czech police are working with the British police," confirmed police spokesman Katerina Randl.
"We share information together on the case," he added.
The reported patrol after Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 cm high, it is loose and has a long eye and long same hair of the same color.
She should go from Uherskohradíška.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are afraid of her, such a loss is still very unusual for her
In the afternoon after Peter, Harriet Harman's delegation also started.
She started to raise the planes with Petry's face.
"We have great concerns about it," she said at the Saturday press conference.
As a result of the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it's not clear who he was and what he had with Peter.
Česko is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a steady decline in the attacks, the last month with the coming end of the year, the attacks intensified significantly.
We signed a major campaign on 18 November in connection with Agent Tesla.
Flights are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attack strategy remains the same.
The infected Annex in the e-mail must draw the user's attention to the name referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month there was a dangerous annex in the name of the invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the accounts correction for 11,2021...exe," Martin Jirkal from Esset said.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The malicious code is actively searching for stored login data which subsequently sends to attackers.
The last powerful campaign took place in Česk on the fall of August and September and with the close of the festival and at the end of the year the activity of the attackers is again growing.
In November, the formbook was also active.
In contrast with Agent Tesla, the attackers did not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security experts in November attracted more campaigns with a global dimension.
Compared to the October data formbook, he slowed down in November, but continued to stand for at least five of all detectives.
The flights continued throughout the month with an increased activity on 3rd, 10th and 15th November.
Formbook contains most of the attachment with .exe which does not contain the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account also appears.
The Annex may then be more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decrease in the number of activities is reported by security analysts in the Fareit programme, which was 1.6 per cent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic in the last few months had no greater impact campaign.

It's definitely not going to be a left or middle touch, you guys.
The triad vaccine is almost definitely going to become a multiple vaccine because it is obvious that we will have to wait every half year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
