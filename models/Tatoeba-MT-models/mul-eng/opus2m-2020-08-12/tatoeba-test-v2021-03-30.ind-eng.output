I just got it.
You have to go to bed now.
He had a clear view of Christianity.
I really like my job.
He lived by God’s standards
What if we have a party?
No one cares.
Wake up!
He's an easy teacher.
Whatever you choose, it will bring you great benefits.
Are you planning on going abroad?
Tom looks confused.
The day is heavy enough.
I'm suffering from a severe toothache.
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
I just want to say I love you.
Let's wait until the rain stops.
Let go of Tom!
I spent three hours looking for Tom.
Tom's teacher is a basketball coach, Mary.
Once in America?
Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't.
I have a friend of Tingkok and want to ask him to teach me Mandarin.
So close to seeing John selling drugs, he reported to the authorities.

Who told you I was sick?
Take care of yourself!
This map is hidden in the dark of night.
What's the biggest lake in Germany?
I'm taking advantage of this good opportunity.

It's been hot all year.
Before he comes, I can't go.
Bettu!
He's drinking the water.
I have to visit Tom.
How's it going today?
How long have you been leaving?
Don't believe what Tom says.
You've been thinking about this since the morning.
That's fruit.
I'm tired of serious fluids.
These things get free beer in.
Do you use English?
Hello, how are you?
What you need to do is sign your name here.
He hates the party.
There's something I want to tell you.
"Did you ever see Tom carry a bag?" "Tom? No, never."
I did it every Sunday morning.
I'm so glad it's funny.
He left it.
Tom wants a 'sport' car and doesn't even care about a family car.
It's amazing!
It's good.
It's stuck in a hot cup of coffee.
My sister arranged for you to have a snack.
At first I didn't know.
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

It's crazy!

Unfortunately, you have to go to Japan.
I'll give you some advice.
He seems to be getting sick.
I'm not sure yet.
Do you want something to eat?
What hope do you have?
That must have attracted Tom's attention.
The ticket went into the museum at $30.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom eats alone every day.
Let's keep our marriage together.
You're not busy right now?
This room has its AC.
Why didn't you help him?
I got married when I was 19.
Don't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair's on.
Can I have something to drink?
All right, I've done anything I can.
Please wear your shoes.
Tom's always good for me.
Where does he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We don't have to let Tom know.
Have you eaten dinner?
I was thrilled when I read it.
Where are you staying?
My goal is to learn your language.
I want to go get a drink.
When are you going to leave?
Why can Taro speak English that well?
Let's do it now.
You're spreading lies.
What's up?
I'm expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are usually very wise.
I was sleeping while Markus came home.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko wouldn't answer my questions.

Like my father, like my son.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom shows the floor.

I am happy to help her.
Learning about this foreign culture was fun.
When did you get dressed?
Tom won't like that answer.
Oh, right?
I think you're trying to contact us back then.
Without a warrant, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
It's too thick until it can't be used to cut meat, and finally I use my own knife.
He's blind on his face.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a loser.
Where are you going?
The light is gradually used to adjust it.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room has a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have missed that red light.
Bring me a glass of water.
I'm making sure I don't.
The smell's so bad.
The fifth is a sentence.
There is no god but He, and no god is the Messenger of God.

You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get on Intercity-Express.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brothers love music.
It's so easy to get in touch with Tom.
You want to go home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this day.
"We don't have to wait two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this sign for the rest of my life."
Tom's one of my friends.
Tom sent me three more messages yesterday.
I just let Tom know what Mary told me.
There's corn, there's corn.
You'll never find a way home, through a straight stone road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy's driving the car.
The return card will come soon.
Please read it again.
When can you do it?
I'm just crying.
Tom's almost fine.
I went too.
Love never goes wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already been incurred in order to complete the investigation.
You don't really want to learn logos, do you?
Tom was trying to get Mary to help him.
Two things are not involved.
How could I not know this?
What's this called?
I'm still home because the rain is falling.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no fundamental difference between the cultures of these two countries.
He's around.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
That may have influenced their decision.
It's raining all night long.
Tom started surgery.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that a threat?
I'll buy this bag for you.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary rejected the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting next to his grandchildren.
The boy just fell asleep on his knees.
Jim is still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on those clues.
That man died a few hours ago.
Are you going to eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We knew that the front door was locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't swim.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your attention.
We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying.
I thought he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this hard book in a week.
It's important to choose that time.
Tom, are you okay?
We've got a lot of supplies.
More important than gold is health.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You're never gonna be alone.
When I walked all this way, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are subject to law - abiding standards, but those who are rich at times may receive increased benefits.
He must have worked.
I like cats.
It's finished at nine o'clock.
Tom is mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We were facing a difficult time in the winter.
I have to ask, right?
Let's look for solutions that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, but you can't drive.
Can I see your coat?
He seemed to be reading it seriously.

He's a legacy from his father.
He has good words to humiliate himself.
Maybe I'm tired, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but finally he failed.

They're crying.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom kissed Mary.
At least 40 percent of the students went to college.
Tom put his pen on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom made his voice sound so loud that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Did he take long?
He admitted it every morning when he entered the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very expensive, better than on the left.
We don't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at the Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
It's often not accurate.
Wake up!
We're on our six-and-a-half.
We're picking that dog up Tim.
He quickly opened the letter.
Where's the train station?
Tom forced Mary to follow him.
It's been an hour.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knew him surprised him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
It's just getting out of here.
They're crazy!
