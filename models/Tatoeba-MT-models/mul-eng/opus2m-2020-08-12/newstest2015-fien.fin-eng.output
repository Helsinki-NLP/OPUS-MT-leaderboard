Putin: Ukraine's armed groups
Russia's President Vladimir Putin charged every Monday that they refuse direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists.
At this point, the head of Kiovan would not want to conduct an ongoing political debate with his country in the east, Putin said the IT-Tass news agency.
He also said that the Russian-Muslim separatists, who said that Kiova and the West were the helpers of the Russian army, were trying to recruit Ukrainian troops longer than they were in their current location, where Putin said that the Ukrainian army was shooting civilians.
The aim of the military is to remove these armed groups and their society so that they can't afford to shoot the residents of the region, Putin said.
The event was organized in the morning and in the afternoon at the Ryrmikorjam.
It was surprised that the message had come from the very beginning.

In Finland, a law which restricts the acquisition of explosives is binding on them.
In the case of individual individuals, the Police Administration shall continue to request permission to purchase or maintain any substances or substances that could be used as such as explosives.
These substances include vettyperoxide, nitrogen, typium acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate as well as the sequences if the specified concentrations exceed.
Vetyperoxide is for example in cleaning and washing agents, but its concentrations are generally not greater than limit values.
Nitromethane, for example, is used in an emergency.
However, before the entry into force of the law, acquired raw materials may be kept in hold and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioli: Super Raheem Loisti - Mario remained hidden - Valioli - Night-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is regarded as a hope for the future of an English footballer.
White Hart Lane had an electric airline every Sunday when Mario Balotelli's Liverpool arrived at Tottenham.
Super Marion’s first appearance was promising: experienced English engineers saw a 24-year-old Italian work in the field in a very different position than in Manchester City.
Ballotelli was still far away from her hippie.
The Italian lost three quality land and ate only half of its food for six years.
The Polish fans who have already taken the lead in the game are waiting for better.
Liverpool Manager Brendan Rodgers was seated on the side of the Barcelone in the Ballotell, Luis Suarez's role as the second opponent on the side of Daniel Sturridge.
As a star in the group, the center of the team, Raheem Sterling, was set up instead of Balotell, which was the center of the team, which was the end of Hugo Lloris's 3-0 major open country.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just look like he works.
Ballotelia 20 cents shorter English is between the opposite lines than in the water.
The feature is not common to a player who boasts at best about 20 miles [34 km] long.
Rodgers also deserves great appreciation for Sterling's development.
After the reception, the Northern Irelandn told of the systematic development of Liverpool by Wembley of a growing number of players who are more powerful than the most powerful player in the world.

The Rovanian Women's Airport Transgroup Women Volley composed overruns to the Vampua Urheilers in the final Sundays of the exercise market.
The Vampula claimed a reference to one of the Russians to win from 3-2.
The last one was destroyed by WoVo 15-11.
The neighbor was in front of the whole time.
The fight was good, but in defense games and passports Vampula was a little better, seen WoVon manufacturer Teemu Mäkkyrö.
WoVon's six months was a sad fact that the 190-cent American center Jennifer Keddy was on the bright side.

Karolina Kyllønen was the most powerful association with WoVon, despite her being a playful, and formed with Johanna Pekkeris.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 years.
The best part of the Vampoo was to take advantage of the Russian passenger as well as the liberal Hillaelina Hegeläinen, who turned WoVo as much as possible.

Access to post-diagnosed and protracted treatment in seldom-established areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, have published a video for mothers who died in the summer of 2007.
In Australia, women who live in rural areas are at greater risk of dying of malaria than in cities.
Researchers visited more than 1100 Australians in 2005 in patients who received a urinary tract diagnosis and found that only 35 per cent of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
According to researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, women living in remote and remote areas died by 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
OUTER CARTON: New medicines may delay bone marrow and urinary tract
The researchers went through the seven years of women’s health history.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, also at the time of a woman’s age and diagnosis, the type of urinary tract, previous diseases and socio-economic status were affected by the possibility of recovery.
The likelihood of survival during diagnosis was low in older women and their diet.
Women living in remote and remote areas died 20 per cent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to explain why women outside the city are less likely to survive the ovarian army, but Jordan considers that it is possible to cause delayed diagnosis and difficulty in accessing treatment.
"Gynaecological oncology special doctors are best able to treat this disease, and most of their receptions are in large cities," Jordan says.
Although the treatment to be carried out as a preventive service is generally of low importance and the importance of distance is low, in addition to these studies, researchers suggest increasing the mobility of doctors so that special doctors can treat patients closer to these homes and programs that help patients with remote treatment.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian diseases is very poor despite the geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better nutrition prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33 families living in the Gold Coast, Elisha Neav found a poor harvest.
The city of Rovanieme wants to strengthen its location in the friendship park, located near the hotel in North Ånjanhov.
On Monday, the city administration decided that the proposal for a position of the Forum and its immediate environment should be set up in Oswieda for public-visual services.
Opinions on the Environment and Life Centre of Lap are requested on the proposal.
With the help of a change of location, the city wants to make it possible to continue its journey-related motorcycling operation.
The site is intended to form a forest area which should include the area between the present Friendly Forest and the region between it and the river.
On 15 November to 30 April, the site shall receive a permanent maximum of 200 engine cycles.
The area shall also be subject to the assigned part of the tanking points.
You're allowed to move to a new forest area.
The city of Rovaniemen has rented out the area of the Friendship Forest for the Safari companies during the winter.
The lease agreement has been renewed for the last summer of 2014 and is in force for the spring of 2018.
The long-term parking operation and the change in design have been a major challenge.
The residents of neighboring resorts have been in their nests for both voice and concern for their emissions.
However, the emissions of the area have been examined and no findings have been found to be above the thresholds.
Renewed expenditure is also older than emissions.
The friendly park area also supports that if the place of departure is to be moved further, the hotel's Safarians should drive to Safari's destinations on buses that would be estimated at 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and the neighborhood of the friendship forest are also large enough for the locals, better than for replacement sites, such as the west side of the Ounasjo hills.
In view of its location, it is good that activities can be extended in the future, for example, to the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of the parking operation is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovanjem Municipal Authority, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business by providing adequate quality areas for the logistics and operational success of areas.
The friendship forest has also been marked as a starting point for motorcycling to discuss a partner who has not yet received legal power.
The number of properties is shown in tree branches
The reduction in the number of tenants, particularly in the 35-year-old group, can lead to a reduction in the trade of timber mines by ten million when young consumers reach their age for the "principal group" of timber mining.The Financial Times told the study of the Baltic-British Trades Association, HTA.
According to the Financial Times report, only 55 per cent of households use the amount of money.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in very urban areas where there are no trees. In addition, the entire tree tree is smaller when it is grown more and more like a parking lot. These factors also threaten the forest area, which is estimated at about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the large area of London, the property has been reduced from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years and it uses domestically at least money throughout the country.
According to the HTA and the British Forestry Association (RHS), however, increasing or reducing the rent of dwellings does not mean that people cannot grow crops.
The RHS's leading tree harvesters, Guy Barter, say that "for example, growth in transferable plants is particularly recommended in the middle of the housing sector, as such growth rates can be taken into account if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the result of the redundancy of the resale of the wood sector, as the ownership and availability of dwellings increased from the end of the 1980s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will decline due to better regulations this year, which will be worse in the past few years than in March and April.
Turkey is hearing a United States diplomat on the basis of an official report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on the protection of the Americans and the British in Turkey.
According to Minister of Finance Bullent, the experts of the United States of America and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that the annual documents of the National Security Agency (NSA) of former analyst Edward Snowden reveal Turkey as the main focus of the U.S. and Iso-Britain Information Services.
According to the Turkish news services, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underlined the importance of the report saying that all major countries are blind to each other.
In the past, the German intelligence service reported an even more angry reaction in the Turkish Government during the siege of Ankara.

Majorcan Magalufin police officer responsible for corruption
The incident revealed evidence that police and city administration officials of the city of Calviana had committed an incriminating in Mallorcan's office on Friday.
The Calvian police officer in Mallorcan Lomaz has been detained as a result of the corruption in the Magalufin region known for its campaign.
Colonel José Antonio Navarro was appointed as a researcher after several Punta Ballena street operators presented corruption against him. The Punta Ballena street is located most of the Magalufin bars and evenings.
According to the newspaper Mallorca Diario, the case revealed evidence that police and city administration officials of the city of Calviana had been involved in a fraud in the office of the prosecutor against the corruption of Mallorcan.
The national map of Spain held two other local police officers in contact with corruption companies, and they are heard by the judge together with Navarro.
The ABC newspaper, which is published throughout the country, wrote about the side of the angry authorities of the owners of the night, which was a major challenge to their business.
"There is no money in this matter, but recovery," said one of the prosecutors to the court.
You're not gonna ruin our life.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf was in many countries looking for newspapers this summer when on the Internet he posted YouTube video, where an 18-year-old British lottery starring at 24 men during a pub crash.
The authorities of the island have since tried to slow down Magalup’s uncontrollable use of toys by reducing the participation rate of drug addicts, alcohol addicts’ pubcrowli.
In addition, the Playhouse collection, where the oral video was described, was assigned to be closed for one year, and the owner and pubcrawl organizer were assigned to Carnage to pay together EUR 55,000.
First of all, the recommended tourist destination of young British tourists in Magalufin has also been recommended for the Balcony trend, which has led to several accidents caused by alcohol use when people have been admitted from parvet to another or parvet to the hotel's swimming pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the Gaza War
The Israelis returned to the Gaza Strip on Monday to school in hot bombings when the rockets and the Kranatins bombed their communities during their 50-day war in Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed during the war in the region.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in bombing rockets in the communities of South Israel, but the follow-up to the wars is still visible.
In the city of Ashdod, located in the south of Pashosh, workers removed the trails from the walls and smiles before the children arrived at the day-to-day skiing.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in Saad-named towns, Israeli municipalities, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, says that after a long period of school, she feels like "a little weird".
"There have been difficult times between us where we haven't gone anywhere," she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited his support at the border of Gaza.
By the beginning of the last week, thousands of residents of Saudi border communities had stayed in the interiors or had left for the safer areas of Gaza longer than ever before from the arrival of rockets and cranes.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspicious of the return of a 4-year-old son of the Palestinian Kranaat in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a few ten families have not yet returned.
Children of these families have been placed in secondary alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited school in Sderot, near the border city of Gaza, which was a heavy point of Palestinian history.
She encouraged the children to study carefully and promised that they would "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas have agreed to a second fire in force in the last decade.
The Council of Ministers immediately stopped fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many open issues, such as the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt of Hamas and the reopening of the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants to take revenge on the weapons of Hamas and return to the body of Israel’s lost Israelite army in two wars.
In Egypt, the start of the new unfair negotiations is expected later this month.
According to estimates from Palestine and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel had different views about the number of dead, and at least half of the dead were soldiers, although there were no visible evidence of this.
On Israel’s side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including domestic workers.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and skulls in Israel’s cities for the most part in the south.
On behalf of Israel’s army, over 5,000 air raids and other attacks were carried out.
Israel’s faithful ones suffered or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people were protected from over 100 United Nations schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in their homes and during the war, school authorities moved to school last week.
"I hope that school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Muhammad Amara, who lives in the city of Gaza.
According to the average generally used population prices have increased by most over seven years in Australia as a winter month.
The price index for the cities of Australia's capital city was 1.1 per cent in August, which measured the prices of the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic.
As a result of the rise in prices for summer, summer and summer, the total increase was 4.2 per cent, more than the same month after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as many as during the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased equally around the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless Sydney and Melbourne, prices are rising at high prices.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
The most vulnerable housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next; the average price increase is about five-six per cent.
The lowest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government deficits.
According to Lawless Australia, the number of residences on sale will increase during the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in sales of high-saled dwellings, generally low sales prices and still low levels, it is likely that the increase in prices of dwellings will continue during the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has brought predictions to Mantt
The new museum and pictures have led to the foretold public events in this summer of Mäntt.
By the end of August, Serlachius had visited more than 70,000 visitors.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and there have been, among other things, classic pop art themes from Andy Warhol and Roy Liechtenstein.
On Monday, I was again told that I had visited 14,500 interested people at the Etkins event this summer.
These figures have not been found.
A small door and windows have been shut," says the director of Paul Sivonne Serlachius.
Sivovenen estimates that the whole year's travel period will be close to a hundred thousand in the Serlachius museums this year.
In the past few years, there have been some 40,000 passengers.
There are about 11,000 inhabitants in the Mäntta-Vilppala, located between Tampere and Jyväskyl.
President Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always open at night.
"The challenge is to make the statement permanent," she says.
It also hopes that the art will continue to last longer.
New exhibitions are being opened in the dark.

I lost my amphetamine to a murder in Kayana
The loss of ten grams of amphetamine is necessary to lead to the murder of a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to his divorce and had spent his life with another man and shot at him to bring drugs to his suspect resident, 34-year-old Kanayan.
The defendant accused the case and claimed that he had been shot by another man.
The incident became known to the police when the police were stopped by the police party, where the suspect was burning clothes used in blood.
In addition to burned batteries, the car found a broken hole.
The Court of First Instance shall, in fact, grant a judgment later.
It was a very rare summer in many places.
According to the air plant, the average temperature of the same temperature is repeated in 10 years.
The statistics of the Air Agency show that the average temperature in the entire country was higher than normal.
Most of the country's derogations were of one degree or two.
As a result of the outbreaks of rebellion and genocide, the rest of the country became more and more hotter than usual.
In the first week of August, the highest temperature was measured in Portugal, with an average of 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never wanted me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in 1958 in the British Midlands region of Dudley, where seven children were born.
Henry's father worked at his job and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry's best practice for Rudy's Rare Records comedyshow, which is partly based on his father's visual conversation and which has been developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The voices are mixed with reggae and rappy in the upper leg.
Henry's got to go through some rough childhood memories.
He has often been treated after his mother's death, and he has much to do with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His growth was never seen, but my voice said, "Stop the metal."
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of the rose tree or the beauty of the cricket tree.
I've never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the man with a smile on my neck, reading his words.
Henry recently opened up a metal mine in Dudley and thus got the idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are now better than they were then.
Sculptures are now slightly brighter but they are actually dark, sandy, labyrinthic depths that feed on liquids, sand and bones and bring to mind the import.
My father was about to leave for the winter and only the land on his own, and later he began singing his own song of praise from his own body.
As I walked around the corner, I realized that he had done this work for years to get us food from the table, and I began to appreciate her more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked the parents ’ approach.
My father never wanted and never said he loved me.
Just when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to share our love for each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter with Dawn French, and through her child she's been able to share the love she missed herself as a child.
Do you have to say "I love you" all the time?
Stop that shit now!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Franklin.
Why aren't we friends?
He's a great mom.
Henry's still a good friend with Frank, who had been married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good man.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
He's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one reason that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from hypertension and diabetes, my doctor told me to make a complete decision.
After that I started a lot of people, and I also had to start a bank diet to reduce my symptoms.
It's very hard...
I'm sorry, and I'm tired.
No one enjoyed eating porcans.
Henry's known short party field depicts his transformation during his development.
As a result of receiving a lot of good return from the critics, Othello has been responsible for making the theatre.
The following year there were Comedys Comedys and August Wilson Fences ("Aids").
Making the theatre offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedys, which Henry has done all his time.
Henry started working in the field when he was only 16 years old.
One of his clients noticed him making imitations on the floor and contacted the New Faces skills contest.
Henry's TV-ura started in the mid-70s. "Maybe for a long time I was the only black model and comet," he says.
Henry learned how to do his job.
I had to grow up in the light of the public, I had to learn to produce jokes from the spring of 1975 to 1985, while my life was involved and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the rights to display The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared as black-headed, so Henry decided to be a comedy program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I would never have participated in it, but I wouldn't lose it.
Although my position was strange and painful, I was able to work on major events and learn how to treat the public.
Nevertheless, the "Britt-TV's paid, multi-year favorite and soft entertainment programme" was also "a great parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 80s in another comedy line, where it was said that black culture was admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first class was shown in 1984, and in the '90s, Henry was known as the "Gareth Blacklock" in the Comedian Chef!
The next ten years, Henry took notes, documents, TV series and films in pairs, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.TV series, he said to himself: "What you're going to do next, Len – now it seems like you're just playing in your place or driving on the sidewalks."
The next day, Radio 4 was a documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't actually taught us well at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that uses soccer and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's age awakened my fear.
All the people we're facing in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – told me, "Try.
Don't ignore all the thought before you know what you're talking about.
Well, let's just say something and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spoke 20 words from Othell's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I knew I could do this.
It felt like some part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is about it, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your leg, do a little background study.
So the training process was very good, and I read the sample for months before it was done.
The show was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon after that, Henry showed up his head at the Erehdys comedys.
Suddenly I showed up in the British national character, and I couldn't really believe it.
At some point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
On one occasion, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that his duty was to offend the public.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to spend 10 minutes alone until your computer works again.' "
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was corrected.
I walked out of the mirror, and part of me would take care of the relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it in the hands of others.
"You're part of the show, stay in your role"
Henry in the "Fences" show in the Duchess theater
The "Fences" exhibition was challenging.
The panic is a good thing. It makes a person more patient.
This also was taken very seriously, so it was age as a sign of the gods: "This is what you must do."
Of course, this Henry says in KUMEALLA's voice.
Then I decided to stay here.
I love this job.
I love the exercise rooms.
However, Henry is still at the core of the complication: the small boys are constantly interrupting our discussion when he exchanges imitations to another.
Keeping out of stand-up comics is a matter of concern because getting immediate thanks to the public without being aware of it is dangerous.
If you keep breaking it, it can lead to your baby.
I spend a lot of time on Apollo theaters when I feel it, but I usually take it out of my way as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's gonna go to the new stand-up.
I find real joy in sitting with the leader who helps me form the entire stage of the journey, the middle and the end, and I don’t think I would ever want to end that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like to show you...
It's really fun.
The exhibition continues to tell the story, and it's a pleasure to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya creates a register of officials to remove "female workers"
Kenya has started to create a biometric register by attempting to remove "industrial workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who have not notified the register for the next two weeks should no longer be paid, as notified by the government.
The government is in doubt that thousands will still be paid a wage if they are left in office.
President Uhuru Kenya has promised to continue the corruption of the public sector after it was officially committed in 2013.
According to a previous review this year, the wages and other economic abuses of "smoker workers" amounted to at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that payments will be paid to the bank immediately after the person has died or left his office, BBC Wandaw Chebusir reported on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials should be notified within the following weeks at the recognition centres to ensure that their data are recorded in the biometric registration format, informed by the government.
According to the report, all those who leave this without proper cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure explains the public sector in a significant way, as it determines how many people actually do their work, and it also clears the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving "the problem of workers"," says Anne Waiguru, the official of the Ministry's office for development and planning.
The financial result of the 2015 Walls account may be EUR 25.5 million if the city adapts to its activities and progress in the difficult economic situation.
On the basis of this current budget provision, there are some 9.4 million deficits for the year.
As possible intensification of the scope and level of services, the purchases of services, the sale of property and aid, and the addition of tax and tax products were mentioned.
The EUR 10 million investment target is 8.5 million.
It's not easy in the case of the King.
The new obligations imposed on the king, the increase in tax income, the increasing unemployment and the drop in state interest by five per cent continue to weaken the vision.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city administration is unique in that the savings must be made in time.
The ship must be converted to the objective of the strategy by President Kimmo Heinonen of the City Management Board.
The city administration returned the presentations made in preparation for the steering group.
The proposals for urban administration are based on the budget proposal at the Economic Seminar of the Authority in France on 8 September.
After the mandate seminar, the proposal for a budget will progress through quality management through urban administration and urban authority.
Five Turkish police officers were arrested as suspects of the "juniment" government
All 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey as suspects of "the anti-government conditions", whereas local media sources are increasing.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
The group held by Hurriyet Daily News included 14 high-value police officers.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December aimed at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey for organizing and monitoring a wide criminal unit.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at the time) said that he and others were part of the activities of the Islamic police chief Fathullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of Ukraine's schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer.
This is a very important day for families, and in the way of thousands of other Ukrainian seniors, Prime Minister Arseny Yatzenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the suppliers that not all schools have opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the future generations of the earth:
The first day of September was not held in each school.
There's no peace in Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
All over Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian population must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at the Slaviansk school, where Yatzenyuki's daughter goes, speaks Russian.
We hope that peace will return here in the evening and that children will be able to receive lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is usually part of the celebration of the children’s weddings, the atmosphere, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the replacement tweet was unwarranted.
On Twitter, confirmed by Governor Rick Perry of Texas, a photo of the border manager of democracy was posted on Sunday evening on charges of abuse by the government during this hearing.
The tweet was removed later, and it was followed by a new tweet, where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent to my cell phone.
"I don't accept the tweet and I've removed it," said a later publication.
The family's back forces did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's fixed Twitter account, it's unclear who would publish the picture.
The first tweeted in the original film of Travis, a border official from Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to a registration in April 2013.
Perry stopped the funding of the Lemberg Office when this was refused to separate, leading to a large assembly of fire department in Austin this month accused of being Perry. Perry is a proposal for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of my tweet was, "I don't always have time in my pocket, three times allowed by the largest promulgation number... but when that happens, I charge Governor Perry with a warrant."
I'm a democratic citizen of Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct a study by a large team against Perry.
The study was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special agent in San Antonios, who was appointed by the President of the Republic.
Perry has said she's guilty and called for political reasons.
His influential court has asked the court to dismiss the charges and has said that the law on the basis of which a governor is charged in Texas's most far-reaching office is a violation of the basic law.
Perry gave $7.5 million of State support to a unit responsible for state non-sustainment operating in the Travis region and dealing with public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to separate.
The decision of the family was given to the left by the follow-up team to issue an official complaint.
Perry's fixed Twitter records are regularly updated – and others are also heard.
To be released to the fifth place at the Ivan election meeting in 2012 during its presidential campaign, Perry threatened to finish his final step by publishing his own picture on Twitter on the line with the text "Come to us, South Carolina!" series.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again "normal"
One of London’s most important investors has warned that the housing market in Kaakkois-England has been "blowed" to a normal level of activity.
The residents of the capital of London have had a difficult demand and a low price at the same time as they were afraid of spreading a credit card, which enabled the Bank of England to impose restrictions on residents in June.
On Monday, Prime Minister and President Tony Pidgley said that "markets and trade levels have returned to normal since the beginning of the financial year" after the year 2013" and that this has enabled "a stable operating environment".
In the London housing market, during a well-known period, foreign investors went to the capital city.
According to Maarekister, the city's population prices rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of private, fair and school buildings in Berkeley rose about five years ago, reaching 423,000 pounds by the end of April.
However, the confirmed point has made London less attractive in recent months - part of the interest has also been affected by new state taxes and political rhetoric on possible "cartano tax" before May.
In the past week, London’s state-of-the-art operator Foxtons warned that the April housing report, which contained more stringent loan rules, would lead to lower market growth levels, as well as the sales rates and prices ratios in the second half of the year.
The UK bank’s young data showed on Monday that the number of loans received was reduced in July, referring to the fragile housing markets.
Founder Hamptons International has calculated in 2015 predicting prices for London. The prices are estimated at three per cent, as the price index measuring the prices of the tenants has already begun to decline.
The number of trades in London in the most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfari and Kensington has risen in the fourth year back, says WA Ellis.
However, domestic demand in the capital has a blessing for Berkeley, which has grown from sales to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "good planning, the demand for the right product in the best places has stood firm and therefore the sale has been slow".
In June, the company announced its sales of 3,742 new homes in April last year. This is almost a third more than during the previous economic crisis in 2007.
Over the years prior to tax reductions, the profits increased by 40 per cent over the years by 380 million pounds and the trade shift grew by 18 per cent by 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley said Monday before the annual meeting of the company that the benefits of the year of Berkeley are in line with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the previous year's tax profit is 450 million pounds.
The share of Berkeley was sold at a price equal to 23.96 pounds per night in London.
Hacker's hand on Jennifer Lawrenc's bottom cover
Jennifer Lawrence is 85 years old at the Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to be in charge of a hundred other star pictures of the year's Oscar exhibitor Jennifer Lawrenc's hits online.
The representative of the Winter Games confirmed that the pictures are true and judged by the hacker 'to break up a lot of privacy'.
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who publish the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrenc will be charged.
Pictures published from the beginning on the 4chan photo page were apparently wrong because of the weakness of the Apple iCloud recording system. Hundreds of other hacking targets are claimed to be ten other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeeed.
I don't know how much of the picture is true, actually, Scott Pilgrim against the World, Mr. Winston tried hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at me and my husband in private years then take pictures: hopefully you have a good idea," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the "iCarly" and "Victorious" series rejected the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called under-images from me are curious if you don't understand".
Let me do this end right away.
BizzFedin later Sunday announced that Pope Ariana Grande spoke the language of the reality of the images about stars.
Just to show us how to thank Howard Jacobson for the new novel that tells us about love and the J-book.
They jumped, it was the best thing that ever happened, and they gradually emerged from each other like the rest of the monsters out there.
Only then did he hear from the woman that she was too heavy, heavy, intense, frustrated, and maybe even a little longer.
Then she screamed at him.
He introduced himself to her.
Yeah, he was as good as here.
His last sacrifice was at the beginning, however, a relationship that had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have been easy for him to be alone, and it might have brought his life even some content.
The Song of Solomon had endless hair and he had a beautiful spiritual beauty in a joyful heart, from the northern corner, which was even more expensive and longer than Port Reuben.
He had come south with his older traveling partner, who had been his aunt, who had left the house that was located on the shore but in the most paradise floor, and the name of the lake was also appropriately Paradise.
No one's lived in the store for years.
In all the bathrooms, the floors had been empty, the floors had been left behind by the windows holding all their own places, and the wooden floor was filled with cracks that reminded the remaining days of the streets.
It was like a seed of children, at the same time a dangerous and dangerous tree full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is subject to the 2014 Booker registration agreement.
Proposals to be published in the first week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailein in the midst of the crimson terraces in the middle of a long walk, enjoying a warm winter evening, both listening eagerly to the music and soothing news through which the whole country heard the beautiful music and the calming news when Aileen’s experiences brought him to his mind a song that had long ago been forgotten by the black performances and which his father had often listened to at the bottom of each other’s cheeks.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were originally too aggressive, and they were no longer called at the reception.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were not just called again.
They wanted to leave him alone, just like he did.
In time, general opinions were reached on what was not achieved by law and by publication: just as people in the area of literature chose to include sacred monuments, monuments and novels, they also recommended ballasts for music.
As the day dawned, Kevern began by clicking on a pictorial piano and singing the serenadia on the big feet of Ailein with a loud voice.
The world didn't understand.
"It was a jazzman Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and at the same time released two strings in front of him.
So his father had always done before "j" wrote no card in his mouth.
It was starting to play between him and my father when he was a kid.
His father told him to play the same game with his own father.
If you saved your mouth with a word starting with J, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay the pen.
It wasn't very fun then, and it wasn't it right now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
I've never heard of it before.
Jazziaka has not been officially declared a ban, it has not just been called.
The improvisation was no longer in shape.
There was only one thing in life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's been the same way.
Its unpredictableness has made people dreamy.
And Jazz was shown by music.
Although Kevin wasn't 10 years old until he heard Sammy Davis Junior, the jazz music had come to him through his father's seminal CD set.
Well, at least she didn't need to tell Alin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of Alinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the recommended singers were not black.
There is no need for laws here, no enforcement.
The audience meant that each part of it was accepted as grateful — grateful — that they were as good as saved by the trade — by a principle that each group had done natural things for it.
On the basis of their temperature and physical characteristics, African-Caribian sex heroes are best suited to entertain and play, so they sing and dance.
From the beginning of India, they were like giving gifts with electricity, so they had to make sure that each family had a phone that was used for handling matters.
The remaining members of the Polish community were working as pollinators; the last Greeks broke the scales.
At the time when SE, AS TALASTED, JOS SAPAHTUI went to the truth, they were at home from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose elders had not been mistakenly afraid that they would be accused of breaking up the walls and afraid that the bones would follow them, opened restaurants where labneh-jughurts were offered and burned with water taps, and continued to see their life as a trust and weakness on the ground.
Every one of them according to his gifts.
The world had just heard the ballads, and it was hard for him to understand how the words of Kevin’s own songs were so funny that they never got to dress for music.
I also expressed my love through music.
"They're not really boring," Kevern said.
Except for the idea of big feet.
My father never kissed anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned tree created an illusion of security.
No word would go through the voice of the left-wing paper.
I don't know. I don't know.
Why did your dad love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two horns in the direction of Aileen.
The war was about to take her out.
"It was my father's idea to be interested," he said instead.
The battle broke out as a surprise, and his hair was hidden from Kevin's eyes.
There's no change in the world that's seen as great as Ailein's hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't hear it.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
The war seemed really crazy.
Are my legs like that?
He looked at it again.
They're not really big at your feet.
Your nose, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my bones are too heavy?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too long ago.
"You're going to be surprised at me because of your noses," he tried to fix the situation.
I've been thinking about it.
It didn't help.
She wanted to hear it from her mouth.
Often, when he wanted to disappoint, the effect was quite different, for he, like his father, lacked the assured charm that could control the popularity of jokes.
Maybe his father was meant to be a hero.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted the same.
No matter what you look like, it's fine.
In the same way, Solomon’s harvest was red and rose from the terrace to the floor and poured out the wine that they had just poured out.
The wine was made only of confectionery, so he could not use it as a cause of corruption.
In his heartlessness, he seemed to be as thick as a palm tree’s leaves in the graveyard.
"And your burden is what surrounds me with you," he said...
Except I don't recognize it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailein's own words, and for his own unnecessary words, and for the fear that he had seen in his eyes at the time when Ailen decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he was gonna shoot?
He had never told Kevern about living in a good northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that at least it was the same as living here.
The same great, beautiful sea that was submerged against them.
The same men, indeed, even worse and more ironic after TAPAHTUNE than their driver's and driver's driver's license, were willing to shoot any woman who would dare to answer or test them.
The head of the bag?
He'd see the pressure again if he wasn't careful!
First of all, there was a word about dating a man and a woman’s divorce; then the drug against the love ballasts of the innocent out of their hands was taken and attacked.
It was too much for Kevin to think, since he had already been hated.
The Song of Solomon invited him to leave.
He took himself up from the terrace as an old man.
Ailin also felt like himself, but Kever's death was a surprise to him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They must have known each other.
The world followed him on his way — just as his traveling companion looked at Kevern’s walk up the window — to a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
When Adam left the tree tree, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevin and for the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to kill him.
So he turned into a man who had lost all the fighting opportunity — why did he feel that it seemed so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have never seen it before this moment?
When Alinn Solomon was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years ago, just described as an intelligent and inspiring 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution measuring the General Opinion in Offnow, conducted a short study of the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in areas where violence reduction or the end of violence was likely to take into account the money and energy used to endure it.
"The field has already been reached, and much has not yet been done," he wrote, "that it may take thousands of years to fight, and most of the successful people's natural aggression, especially in their rejected and secreted triangular triangles, where, despite the vastness of their thinking offices, the age-old nature of humanity is rarely known.
However, some things can't be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower it is, the lower its inner mind.
The nation laments for the pair of sentimental ballasts, the many stories of successful resistance and swears in the name of the good things of marriage and family life, but at the same time old publicity is held to be unfashioned in its unbridled behaviour as well as in the rural communities and urban areas, and there is also evidence of a new, worse conflict in the homes, workplaces, our streets and even the playgrounds.
"You must be afraid to dramatize," his leader commented after reading the entire report.
I'd suggest you read less Romans.
We're Nussbaum. We're gonna take a look at the land.
Besides, I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer to that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you free?
First, we have yet to challenge our right to be unresponsive to personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I resist atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no pre-school classes in this workplace.
We are servants of an unprejudiced society.
Although certain overcompensation is entirely acceptable and respectful to you, it can, in turn, lead to wrong conclusions, to what you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call a state of mind or evilness, others usually call it a natural energy and a physical force.
If it happened yesterday, if it happened above it, it would destroy the earth’s basic quality of life.
Asme Nussbaum looked around at Rabinowitz.
After the head of Rabinowitz, a flame-depleting LED light published a directive that Offnow had distributed to the world for the previous quarter or later.
Smile to your neighbors, respect your friends, listen to ballasts, go to the music, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, feel the same way, apologize.
Speech is better than silence and the spoken word is better than written, but nothing can love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice when he was sure that his leader had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively improved as we imagine we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will note that we repeat the same mistakes that have been led by SLIHEN, which has been defeated by JOS SAPAH.
This time we really don't get angry, and we don't trust each other.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid.
This sentence meant endless tolerance.
"You go too far," he said, "in your pictures of 'misleading' things that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also went too far when you said that they'd throw 'their hatred and their distrust to others'."
The person in your position should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we do not speak 'we' or 'them'.
There was nothing "we" or "other".
It was a time of chaos, everything we know about it.
"If we're really real, that's why," Esme added, "no group of societies can say that they're doing well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
It was then.
We don't need to talk about it anymore – we agree on this.
And just as there is no need to share charges, neither need to make corrections, then they were reasonable or not, and even if there was any way to do them.
But what's the future for then if it's not taken for a lesson --
The past is there so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz took his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," she said and said that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day he went to work normally, he became involved in the use of a long motorcycle driver, who walked around the road described as "unclean and ugly".
There's been an accident.
Lesothon's army rejects his plan; the Prime Minister lives in South Africa
The Lesothon Army officials have refused to give up their ambition to attack the government and said that they are acting against the police who were suspected of trying to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane withdrew from the country saying that the army had restricted his official residence and had ordered government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighboring country of South Africa when he was told that he had received a death penalty.
The military representative, Major Ntle Ntoi, spoke out loud and said that the army responded to such a threat that had been caused by "political fanatics." The police have been told to try to shoot fanatics.
"The defence forces of Lesoto took action to obtain a number of information, according to which certain police forces are seeking to use young semi-finals while they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to the President of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Monyela, the military activities of the South African Government have been shown to be a state-of-the-art company.
"Even if no will has claimed its ability to control the forces, the actions of the Lestothon defence forces show all the recognition marks of the opposition government company," he says.
According to the soldiers of Lesothon, soldiers return to the barracks on Sundays, and there was a peaceful feeling in the capital.
Meanwhile, Minister Mothetjo Metsing will lead the government away from Thabane.
Thabane says he believes it's about action because he's been trying to fight corruption.
In Lesotho, there have been a series of surprises since June, when Thabane interrupted the meetings of the delegation due to the differences between the government of the major coalition.
He thus rejects the authority of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Shop page: Microsoft is establishing a data centre in New Zealand
The Microsoft Information Technology Framework has established a large data centre in New Zealand where the company does not agree to adjust its location.
In the information sent to Microsoft media, the company does not disclose the location of all its data centres on safety.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the center was formerly occupied by Oulu or Kajana.
Microsoft ends up at Oulu's station, which takes about 500 people to work.
In all, Microsoft has announced its exit name in Finland at least 1,050 jobs.
Microsoft's messenger Camilla Lindfors tells the STT that the company does not comment on how many staff are working at the new data centre.
The establishment of the data centre was announced to New Zealand on Monday.
A man accused of being a girl's boss in a traffic fair
A 78-year-old man is accused of having a three-year-old girl spent in a traffic fair in Fifes.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl on a cruise in Pittenween in the eastern Neukt.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart was driving Audi Q3 without warning and caused a girl to get drunk.
Stewart, who was at home from Anstrüther, 78, refused charges at Dunde's Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC appointed him to be held in January.
Four chains for the best waterproof pictures and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under the water, you have several different device options to choose.
The best option is to waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about $300.
I took these pictures myself during family worship using several different cameras that each paid less than $350.
Despite the device, there are several rules that support compliance.
Check your device every two times.
Although you should also hold the camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other parts are closed in water.
In addition, set camera image settings to respond to the images or videos taken.
In some cameras or camera and video camera combinations, there is a regulation that optimises the conditions under water.
Also, before you jump into the water, be sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras only endure 5 horse's depth, others even 50-60 horse's depth.
To be known both for conventional and water-containing models in our shopping studios and for digital cameras reviews.
Take a few pictures — many fail in some way.
In compact cameras there is an LCD display that allows you to take pictures when there are not often this feature in action cameras.
Although you would have LCD, it is difficult to see under the water, and the image may either succeed or fail.
Then take a few pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to take multiple images on a number of occasions by different regulations, you will benefit from this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced in depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface of your pictures in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
In this way you can also see more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try getting close to the point.
This is important advice on the ground, but even more important under water because light conditions are narrow.
It is very important when you use the action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens that has a wide picture, i.e. the image must be close to the point so that the point fills the entire frame of the image too.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leader – the cost of voting
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters should not vote on the proposals for a growing democratic reform of the 2017 elections, despite the need for a reform of peace.
The decision is likely to give rise to long-term protests from the Hong Kong business card by planning activists and implementing only thoughts after the decision has been published.
In practice, the decision of the People's Congress of China will give the Communists the power to remove all the proposals that do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still welcome," said the President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Peking promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongans.
It's clear that we're working with self-government.
Mr Li Fei, Vice-President of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese Government, saying that the general proposed appointment of the head of Hong Kong would be too 'out of reach'.
Since 1997, when I left the United Kingdom from Hong Kong to China, Peking has promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders on Sunday, the decision was a democratic transition, as Hong Kong could vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to closely monitor the election process through the nomination committee managed by Beijing.
According to the new draft, only those who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
The previous summer of the decision in Hong Kong, some of the biggest and most important protests in the region were held over the years.
Following the democratic campaign, there was a large part of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which the organizers have threatened to block the operation of the business card unless Beijing gives Hong Kong the truth of the general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just after the release of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong headquarters.
In the opinion, the organizers of the movement announced the time of the new movement's civil unrest and would receive protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not clearly tell the details that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a network release, the organizers said that the movement "should be more than Occupy Central as the last means to be used if there is no hope for dialogue and no other way".
We are very sorry when we announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the rule of the debate has to be taken place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing a report for Beijing for days, and on Sunday security activities were very tight near the government's headquarters.
In Hong Kong, peace is a source of many of the feelings that people are slowly losing their city of government.
A range of goods and services obtained from manter has led to competition.
In addition, living in fear of Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, is losing its grip on Beijing's growing pressure.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central business because its interests threaten Hong Kong’s animal life — a world of business.
"Protest they're talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how much it takes and how long it lasts," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long considered the move.
We don't want to worry about Hong Kong getting away from us.
That would be a bad investment.
The media of the Chinese state have also presented stories that say Hong Kong Democrats are the authorities of the Western Powers of the Government."
This summer, activists organized a national vote on informal voting rights, involving 780,000 people, over a fifth of Hong Kong voters.

The U.S. prom-peripheral is awarded to British universities: details for new students
We respond with encouragement to this day's students by setting up the first lead class in Britain.
In addition to private flights, the company offers other travel routes such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 in order to ensure the customer's best access to the university.

Today’s students are very different about their expectations and expectations than 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create an early priority plan, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticised a service that is not realistic.
"This service plan has a real far-reaching effect on the life of more students," said former president of the High School of the Order, Megan Dunn.

Corapallo: Fanie's promotion almost too much: Sasu Salin was turned into a field
Corapallo Sasu Salin was the body of the Finnish winner today.
He was able to forget his sister-in-law from the United States and shed the blood of the other half of Ukraine in a stand-alone solution.
But Salin transferred everything to the Susifans and did it in the same way:
I was going to turn there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, I couldn't do anything.
That metal and white general was almost too much for me.
The contents of the compartment were to include nine surfaces in the immediate wish, palm trees, leaves, and temples at any place where they occurred.
I don't know how it went like that, but I got to a river level that everything worked out.
But sometimes, at some point, even now, at the most important place, Sasu disappeared.
It's my role.
Do everything there.
Now it was great to see that others got caught.
It's stuck all over the place.
Salin is a group of gladiators and spirit creatures, so it is not surprising that his example took the whole group to a plane that was too big and too heavy for the five of Ukraine.
Finland's MM people after 32 years: The former left me with a broken mind
Heikki Montonen ( O.k.) was a Finnish prime minister in Argentina's MM market in 1982.
It's been 32 years since Finland's men's football team played last time in the MM final race.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish artist in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was a Finnish double player and current player agent Jouni Parkkal as the general player.
Kosone and Parkal remember the tournament one more thing than yesterday: it was in the original category to come against France.
"It was a small court game in the settlement of the case," Koson recalled.
We've already won, and both groups have already been set up for backup.
We're going on right now.
We lost it 2-3, and then the rats were more fucked up," Parkkal said.
Finland played Chief of Staff at Heikki Montos's Command and was finally placed as 17th.
Now Finland is once again in a group of world elections when the Polish MM tournament arrives at its speed today.
Many events have changed widely in international airports over 32 years.
Players' power values are designed to be the same class as before, but quality and art are now more.
Players' mean levels have also increased.
The game is faster than that," Parkkal thought.
But how's it going in Poland?
Finnish player material has been expanded and pregnancy can be shared.
I'm waiting for Finland to get out of its origin.
Then it can become harder," Koson said.
Seppo Circa
It was Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen, and Jukka Savio who were in a great triumph against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkali was a general player in the MM market.
We're hoping we're gonna get rid of 17 places now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to sleep," Parkkal said.
The laws of the Reino Kosone were a two-way mining group in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkke were in Tunisia.
Sauna and entertainment in the Buenos Aires seabed are part of the rural group programme in the MM market in 1982.
Kari Kalin (O.D.) was involved with his teammates.

The Finnish authorities saved the Cita dog from the mountains of Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were tortoise on the top of the mountain, Antti and Tuomo Soin offered a great help.
At the end of the week, Mikkelsen was looking for "International Sancairies" on Facebook so he could thank his assistant again.
Miklesen told a public Facebook update that he and his wife had suffered from Cita dogs in the mountains during the tortoise.
The broken dog was no longer able to walk around the coastal country.
I tried to put it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried to pull it up a few times, but its feet didn't just stand up, Mikkelsen writes in his journal.
According to Mikkelsen, the help didn't come from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from an infirmary.
In the dark of the night, the situation has already begun to appear to be a threat.
Fortunately, there were two fighters who were ready to help: the drummer Antti Soin and his father Tumo.
The men were the visitors at the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed toward the beach when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikselsen) was relatively peaceful in view of the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soin tells him to send his message to the Night Sanomi.
In a short time, a German man who was accompanied by a racer was also assigned to the area.
A couple of cases of torture were sent to Cita, where the wounded dog was arrested.
The Germanman came to our place for a moment after us when we were thinking about what to do with the dog and put the dog under his armpit for a moment, Sonin tells us.
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: RUIN
The dog was put down by a wheelchair.
According to the report, the performance was not physically difficult, but in the hard country, it slowed down.
However, after about half an hour, Cita was happy to be down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "International Sancairies" on Facebook so he could thank them again.
The calls also responded to him on Sundays, but the German man is apparently still unintended.
I don't know what I would have done without these saints, Mikkelsen's happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't appreciate them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Sonines were already at home.
They've got some happy memories from Mikkelsen:

The genetic exception is often misdiagnosed
A British woman was afraid of dying for years because of a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years to live because he had diagnosed another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Protoch disease (CMT). It means a group of hereditary diseases that damage the brains and the brains of the brains.
According to Charity CMT UK, wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because they are known to be so small.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT syndrome, which causes motor disorders such as muscle weakness, difficulty in walking and dizziness.
The disease can also cause unconsciousness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was sick with Friedreich’s attack (FA), which has a really bad percentage of recovery.
Rodgers believed he had to go to a wheelchair before he was 18 and died before he was 30 years old.
Today, at 51 years of age, the mother of two children says that "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I've been missing every day, and I've been through it all longer than anyone else.
I was never able to ride or ride with other children, and I was tempted in school because I walked and ran different ways than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several seizures to his feet.
"I felt guilty because I was so rude, so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home and checked the information in my book and wrote to the FA. "
When I got the information from them, I was upset and panicked.
I thought I had to go on a bicycle until I was 18 years old and died before I was 25.
I went through this myself and I planned for my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17 years old, he found that his behavior had not been as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just wanted me, and he said, "Dear girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in trouble."
I think you've suffered something much less dangerous than a disease.
Based on some genetics, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT is, I thought I was fired," she says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to focus on the disease.

Copone: We have good opportunities to win
The hope of the Corapalo group is in the game when Finland is facing the MM crisis in Ukraine's second round today.
If the opening of the U.S. had been expected, Ukraine would also be part of countries where Finland should take the necessary gains to continue.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have good opportunities to win, Peter Kopone ahead of us.
Ukraine found itself in the first instance on Saturday, 72-62 of the Dominican Republic.
The team prepares my NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is in command of Ukraine to play aggressive football.
The opening player of Ukraine is the director of Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a thousand-foot world champion for three years.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter fired 16 points.
Pooh Jeter will leave quickly, but because we've been played against such things before and we have to get our standard defense to the court, Koponen said.

We need to find our strengths again.
I can make sure that there's a normal line of reasoning in the field, Möttel said.
Hollywood's claims are spread on the web - part secured for help
On the Internet, a wide range of under-images are claimed by known public figures.
Among other things, exhibitor Jennifer Lawrence has had to be a "peace campaign" victim.
The TMZ website has published an angry comment by the Lawrenc's representatives, which would seem to confirm the authenticity of the images.
It's a little bit of a detail.
The authorities have been contacted, and any person who publishes stolen images (Internet) by Jennifer Lawrenc will come to the charge, the representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, the exhibitor Mary Elizabeth Winston has confirmed that the pictures spreading from him are real.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that these images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible pain it was for this.
I feel sorry for all those who were supposed to be a hacker's victim, he writes on the page.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice says in his own name that the moving images are wrong.
There are at least some of the Helps or Mistakes from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunstist, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahowski and Teresa Palmer.
"They don't work enough to get out of here."
FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Vikaus Union.
The comments made by paint exchange Walter Referala on Sunday after the VPS treatment are very closely described in the current report.
I haven't had a farmer in four months.
But everything has to adapt," Vitala said after the final match on 1-2.
In particular, during the first half of the course, however, there were a lot of defense errors.
The Mathematician Vitala was not interested in playing a bad defense.
Your players have gone to Hong Kong for this summer, and for that reason the supporters in Vitala have also changed their minds.
I also learned that many young players have been given opportunities that they do not necessarily deserve.
"Some don't have to work enough before they get out of here sometimes," Vitala destroyed any individual player without a name.
Hong Kong Chief of Staff Shefki Kuqi was somewhat similar to Vitala.
"I told some players after the game that if you come to the races and games to have fun and you think you're a failure player and you don't have to do work, you're probably in the wrong group," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of time to a young man.
If they don't want to take this place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that the player cannot expect immediate success when blood is constantly changing.
During this period, there have been no two consecutive meetings.
Especially in defence, the message has changed.
It's the greatest reason why we're here," Kuki said.
Hongka is on the line side after the VPS stop, on the other side with the last TPS.
There are seven more cycles left, so there is still time for the espoulos to avoid falling into the Union.
I've never been on the team, and I'm not going on this.
We're not really going to get to the top of this line," said the painting exchange.

It's not too much of a Christmas.
I remember the game when I was there.
The same was true of about a hundred of the Finnish people who made 20,000 spectators swim, or empty metal.
What would Bekhkone have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraine trial of MM cases?
In Bilbao there are hundreds of Finnish teams of eight and a half times.
The 1995 EM was a time of search for the Finnish Corps.
Men were enamored of their way to the final prize by winning, among other things, in the Russian boxing competition in Helsinki.
That victory would open the door to European courage.
Everything looked good.
He was a promising young man, like Hanno Möttel.
Chief of Staff, Henrik Dettmann, led Möttelölä to the final team.
The fight that many of them felt was different.
Now you can say that Dettmann was very wise, even if everything didn't work out according to the manual.
After the attack, the corpus team will dig your mouth deep.
In the autumn of the year, the Finnishs were certainly more than a hundred of them.
This group includes suppliers, players' relatives, Finnish lawmakers and several fans.
There are also suppliers, relatives and manufacturers, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unmanaged dimensions.
I'm sure no one can say exactly how many Finnish tourists are.
The estimates are between 7,500 and 10,000.
If there were any number between that, it's exactly unmanageable.
Here's an explanation for the performers.
In the global economy, businesses cross borders.
We still have the opportunity to examine how we go internationally.
As we increase mobility, we can use it to see how our girls and our boys succeed in the world, says professor of motion sociology Hannu Itkonen.
I'm sure both in Spain and in the airport MM people in Poland there are Finnishs who are looking for a living.
A common experience.
It doesn't explain everything yet.
It's supposed to be a lot of fun.
The dream is to form part of the popular culture of sport.
It's less likely to go to sports than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses still can't move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, Chief of Staff, Dettmann, challenged the Corps League and the players to abandon the top-of-the-counter.
It's been almost ten years.
Then the direction was changed and the field activity was lifted to the ground.
A plane crash made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoyed the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both types have succeeded in producing their top-up music, where the holy trimity operates: sports media sponsors.
That's where the public is interested.
And the media have taught me what such loving support is, Itkone reminds me.
Are the balloons able to move this massive interest also to home rows?
The average number of hours or a little more than a thousand spectators are played in the corridor and the airport.
The dream has a good question, and it doesn't necessarily give an answer that would promise very good types.
The second school believes that the interest is moving.
The other is the one who doesn't want to make the land full.
This message is ready to travel to the MM people, but their basic idea of home is not of double interest.
There's a challenge for the followers in the middle of the hell.
Bottle tonne insurance - nearly 1.5 hectares from the coast of the lake
Nastola hires the form carrier Valtteri Bottas at the coastal port.
The Kingdom government accepted a total of 1,4 hectares per month at the meeting of the large volume.
In the future, Tonti will have a free-time residence.
The nastola has been followed by Bott's success since this carding time.
He is being tried for the sake of being sent to market with Lachta, Lahde's relatives and Nastola.
The station is located in Koskalas, on the Kärkärve beach.
It has become part of Nastola's real estate.
The area has seven buildings in the garbage dump, from which the city spends six months away by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved formula 1 in the Belgian joint venture this year with its fourth payrollers.
He's on MM five.
Bottas is a modern nastola and lived in the village of Villahtel.
She lives in England now, but she's always in Nastola when she's free from formulas.
Bottas has been visited in high school as well as in youth statistics.

Fortified How to Save in Schoolbooks
The costs of university works in America exceed $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder will soon begin his second year of schooling.
He developed a system where students of later years' courses lend their books a nominal reward instead of selling books on the same path.
"My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid for its use as a whole for about $10 and for the loss," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying Coveant College in Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his last book of his class would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he used $120 for them.
According to the university’s board, the average education teacher spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
The students are more and more determined to use Web sites and creative approaches such as the thought of Schroeder.
More and more students rent textbooks, where they can use the book throughout the class and pay it clearly less than the students who buy it.
According to the Neebo Inc company for more than 250 competitions, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the area show that about a quarter of the books of the university's bookstores last morning were booked books, says Trevor Meyer, president of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
This is the simplest way to save clear money.
Wholesales
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would pay for the campaign's bookstore.
The recommended value of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's book "Calculus" is nearly $290, but the price of the book from Chegg.com's online shop is $239.99.
Purchased
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other memories and spends out there.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used for Chegg.com online sales of $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, tells her last book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" in Amazon.com's online store only $0.42.
The new letter would have paid $48.
Mr. Amherst's College Without Walls, director of Ingrid Bracey and other academics, recommends that students ask their professors if they can use their previous weights on the course.
Secondly, the reform of the new emphasis is not essential for teaching.
In this case, an old weight can only be found at the breaking part of the price which should be reimbursed.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is recommended for use in books shopping.
Vukaraminen
If you take good care of them, remember to return them and don't need them after your course.
By renting you can save more than 80 percent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting the book "Calculus" to the whole class costs about $20.
Known to the rules of the leaser company, such as reminders, use of force and entry into the following payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mail
Acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented where the right to use e-book is paid to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg-trafficking is worth about $61 per month as an e-book of the "Calculus" book.
According to Bracey, many literacy students survive most because many classes can now be downloaded free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
The comparison between the different sellers supports what option is then chosen.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon beginning in Pepperdin's legal system, recommends that you use a good book to find out the price of ISBN because it can ensure that it is looking for the right book.
Before you can access the Internet, make sure that the book is in the warehouse, Gaul says.
He himself learned through this attitude.
Her book delivery was in four weeks, and she finally had to purchase a book at full cost from the university's bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people who died in shelters compared to last year
In capital areas this year almost double the number of people have died compared to last year.
According to the Media Review of the Finnish Rescue Centre (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
At the time of the last year, there were 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
It's been over 65 years since I was 11.
According to the order, the situation was worse by the end of 2009, when 64 people were killed in firefights by the end of August.
A large part of the rent takes place in apartments.
There have been 17 fireplaces, 21 private rooms, and seven rowing and other basements.
Spek reminds us of the security of the house.
At least all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, all should check that start-up devices are easy to use.
All rooms in the house must also be a barrier to removal.
Children should also know what electronic devices they can use when they are alone at home.

French socialists should "be quiet and help France", the head states
Valls strongly called on the left to "show his feelings" to a socialist president in difficulty, who was unable to approve the French majority at the meeting of the new government.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our duty is to stay on his side," said Valls and earned the applause.
The life-threatening Prime Minister asked the government to leave the French opposition 35 hours of work in peace, despite the fact that the new Minister for Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron had given up this week, to give the debate on the emerging proposal that the rule should be governed.
On Saturday, Holland asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Ministry of Justice Christiane Taubura has given rise to differences of opinion on the meeting of the socialist representatives and to criticise the socialist party for allowing France 'to give up hope for the future'.
Mr. Marine Le Pen, Head of the National Constituencies of Non-Discrimination and said that he did not believe that the new government would last for a few months.
Francois Holland has gone to war on the ground, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one had not endured even a few years.
"And no new government will endure until winter or winter," Le Pen told the suppliers.
He reiterated his position on the launch of a proposal by the delegation and was sure that his side was elected in the previous elections and he himself would be ready to lead the side.
The French-led party suffered in the civil war in March, and the abuse of rights was held in the EU elections in May.
According to the weekly Journal du Dimanche opinion, 76% of the French believe that the socialist party may start several competitive groups before the end of the Netherlands in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau of the Po-University warned that the French will soon lose their patience if the new social government succeeds in improving the economy and predicting higher unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly note that the change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, your situation may get worse than before.

We'll check it out on Saturday.

Norwegian Cruise is close to $3 billion on the Prestige Cruise Agreement.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third largest cruise company, is engaged in negotiations to buy its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc at three billion dollars.
After trade, Norwegian Cruise, whose market value is $6.8 billion, would be used by Prestige Cruises, and will continue to compete with the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CRL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to sources, information on the potential contract is already available this week, and it is also possible that negotiations do not produce results.
Prestige Cruises, a private company owned by Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their name to be public because the negotiations did not take place in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises have not responded to comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company has 13 cruise routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, North America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, while its turnover was $2.57 billion.

Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The price of 29 billion dollars is expected to benefit from the growth of the economies developed in the coming years, such as the middle classes of China and India.
Companies compete to make these new customers a common alternative in their choice of cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first shares in the US private market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 sale of which was 850 million dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise was founded at its current meeting in 2000 with the GENT BHD (GENT.KL) Christianry company. The next is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thayn company for entertainment and casino.

The city administration of Tampere is dealing with this matter today.
The animal is hoping to be released from the city administration at the beginning of the prison.
According to the Salla Court of Justice, the time of the definaries in Finland and around the world has come to an end.
Over the last few years, the world has successfully been able to see that there is no biosafety and ethical sustainability of dolphins developed like dolphins.
This view would also be expected to appeal to Tampere.
To stop the dolphin is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question about Tampere's image as a tourist destination, the Court of Justice will note.
According to the case-law, the death of Nisi-delfin confirms the requirements of the action of delfinary.
This death is a terrible continuation of the Delfinary of Særkönniem's history.
It is time to put a point to death, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a border area, to a certain dolphin shelter, the Court of Justice is required.
The nose did not attempt to return to the original life environment of the dolphins, but hopefully the end of the life of the dolphins in Særkennännänn was the only way to experience life other than an uneven bethionate, the hope of the Judgment.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to prevent the use of all animal species in circuses in the complete certificate of protection of animal protection in preparation.
This group includes the dolphins.
In support of the claim, the Acting Director of Animal Health will participate in the proceedings organised today by the Delphine.
Japan's great-grandfather in Helsinki is taking a stand against the dolphin invasion of Japan.
During the fishing season, approximately 2300 dolphins are imprisoned or killed annually, either for use or for food by dolphins.
Putin asked Kiovana to open negotiations with East Ukraine on the new state
Russia's President Vladimir Putin asked Sunday that the Government of Ukraine stop fighting against separatists in the eastern part of the country and start negotiations immediately on the "State of the region", and Russia's news sources are increasing.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist rule of the eastern part of Ukraine should be part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be refocused in order to give the Russian population power to defend their own rights and interests.
The requirement for negotiations with the Russian Cypriots in Putin to the Government of Kiovan is consistent with his apparent strategy, which he has followed up with since the violence began five years ago: he has tried to help the separatists to rule the region and thus force the Government of Ukraine in practice to grant the declared Novorossie independence, which allows it to move from the west of Russia.
In the challenge of State Kanawa 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to re-rule the Western Donetskin and Luhanski region, which the separatists ruled in March and April, connected with the Ukraine Crime itself on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently ended up in the region "Novorossian", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of the
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tasse, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "incidental" as long as Ukraine's policies are campaigning for parliamentary activists held on 26 October and the government's groups are attacking the separatist regimes against civilians in the regions.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical grounds, but also on the organization of society and the status of the Kaakkois-Ukraine state, taking into account the interests of the people there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to "States" is linked to a broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiovan as it seeks to address the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov says.
In this regard there is no debate between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict between Ukraine".
The attention of the representative of the Kremlin, who was intended to correct Putin's 'false interpretation' comment, stressed that Russia's administration is dealing with the separatist occupation of the eastern regions in a different way than that of Crimea, where it is in practice seen as a power in a region where the majority of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to join even Donetsk or Luhanski regions in eastern Ukraine because most of the 6.5 million people in the region are not ethnically Russian and because the majority of the population, according to the previous reports of the conflict, supported the stay in Ukraine.
The independence of the Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give Ukraine's local authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kremlin a practical view of the region of power which unites Russia's Crime.
The Black Sea border border area, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is located by the Russian shipyard as well as by the ports of the commercial sea and historical border crossings.
The region between Rostov and Crimea also has mining, manufacturing and metallic wastes that produce life-threatening products to the Russian army.
The President of Ukraine, Pedro Poroshenko, in his opening remarks on 7 June, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, following the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making of regions other than the nuclear sector in Ukraine on their own economy and their language.
However, his view of suicide appears to be quite different from the separatist view of the Kremlin and Moscow fields.
Putin presented his most recent request to the government of Kiovan as equal partners with Russian Cypriots after the Spanish advance in the last week to increase the presence of Russian tankers and troops in eastern Ukraine in the previously peaceful region on the coast of the Azovin Sea.
The security authorities of Ukraine fear that the withdrawal of Russia's separatist Novoazovsk is beginning with a greater effort aimed at controlling the whole strategically important maritime area up to Crimea.
It has led a massive civil and military team to build Mariupol. Half a million people in Maripol are known as the port city of steel, located between Novoazovsk and Crimea, which is the largest port in the country.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union on Tuesday, Brussels, about additional actions to prevent future outbreaks in Russia in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union, which has been on its own for 23 years.
"We'll get to a point where there's no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not make direct decisions on action; the leaders presented additional actions to enable them to be implemented if the crisis in Ukraine was reopened in the uncertain circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to take their position in the Ivorian region of Ilovaiski and in the last week of the two Russian Pansary and 1,000 troops transferred to Donetsk region to strengthen the difficulties of separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told the suppliers on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Russian soldiers on the island of Ilovakis in Russia was replaced by 10 Russian warheads who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week later.

Australian publications and Gabi Grecko on the subway channel
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been kidnapped by hackers, perhaps stolen by his arrest and the undercover images of Gabi Grecko of Hollywood A.
In the rest of the world, chaos has occurred after the group of Jennifer Lawrenc's under-shows were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging public image hacking channel.
The hackers have been said to be in charge of a total of 60 downplays of the Winter Games Lawrence and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevigne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele and the actor Kirsten Dunstist.
Greek pictures of Australian performers Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovskin and Melbourne have also been apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud year.
The list has 101 public names.
In the last month of Greece, quoted earlier told the Confidential paper, "This is amazing."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal data can be stolen and distributed.
In New York, Greece is reported on a comment in the online journal "degradable" and says that the victims "know themselves as weak".
The hackers believe there are 30 pictures of Palmer with this former boyfriend Scott Speedman, a group of two hostages from Palmer in the upper arm.
Palmer's films include the movie "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahowski and Sugar Punch, Browning show didn't comment on hacked pictures last night.
The representative of Lawrence told TMZ that "there's a lot of detail about breaking up".
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at hackers on Twitter: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, but only from a legal point of view.
