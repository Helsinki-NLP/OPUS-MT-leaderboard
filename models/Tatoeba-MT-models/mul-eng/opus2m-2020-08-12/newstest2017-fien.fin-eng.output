28-year-old cookmaster was found dead from the shopping center of San Francisco
The 28-year-old changing San Francisco was found dead by the local shopping center’s rapper this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who's trying to hurt him, and he says, "He's got a good time."
The body found at Westfield Mall's shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscollian, Frank Galicia, who was said to be a San Francisco suicide investigator.
The San Francisco police station said that death was defined as a personal gathering and that the investigation was under way.
Brother Louis Galicia told the ABC channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a linehog in Boston, had received his dream job as a linekeeper at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Dawters' representative said they were "damaged and crushed" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close family, and they come to love him very much," said the representative.
We're sending our thoughts and our mind to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank slept at the start of the match, but recently "his business was getting really good at last."
"He found a apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling compatibility with the family was to make us eat, make it daily," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of contradictions.
He was a brother who spent time with the wrong guy.
"In a world where so many things are at stake, he was an immeasurable mystery that broke every day more church," he said.
For all who have information on this matter, please call the San Francisco police station for a guide number 415-575-4444.
Doctors for law enforcement: requirements for new anti-working measures
The representatives of the medical authorities have asked their trade union to adopt new employment measures in their dispute with regard to the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) asks the whole Council to support new work-related measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have not been able to take care of the agreement.
In July, doctors and medical professionals voted in favour of a contract that had been agreed with BMA.
58 per cent of the voting members rejected it.
In his letter to JDC President Ellen McCourt, in his letter to Twitter last night, said that the government had been stopped as a "exploited silent" issue leading to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the fully proposed new agreement and its demands for new renegotiation negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a specific response from the BMA Council in order to be empowered to a small and broad programme of work launched early in September.
The dispute has led to the participation of medical practitioners in the sixth session of this year, including the first complete job change in the history of the NHS health care system.
The president of the BMA’s doctorate, Dr. Johann Malavana, separated after the vote after the agreement had been rejected, the BMA’s recommendations.
He had been told to meet BMA members before the vote of 54 000 doctors and teachers that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be awarded to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Foreign Union?
The life that ended up in the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to deal with each other and to declare eight months of the war on words and economic taxes officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague Peter's return to the gold salon, I had a clear impression that this adjustment is more desired in Ankara.
Yes, I was dealt with on the occasion.
But Putin's smile seemed popular, and he didn't even threaten the heat, even according to his own delayed standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about Putin's "dear friend" five times, according to a report.
I'm fucked up.
He also claimed that relations with Russia would return not only to the previous level but even to the better.
The next day, the lyrics here described Erdogan's behavior as nothing bad would ever happen.
From my own point of view, his intensity is quite different from that of others.
However, the concern of Putin showed that Russia's leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian war machine at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was brutal.
I was attacked by a fella because he accused Ankara of missing Moscow clearly.
It was even worse when it became a suspected friend.
Building real trust must be a challenge, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of Russia's large public has also changed since November.
For months, the government's government's media led to an overwhelming, fundamental attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious accusations of high officials were that Erdogan’s family had benefited from the unsaturated oil trade in Isis from the Syrian regime.
He's been resisting this pressure.
But Peter's official message was that it's time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
The Russians won some sort of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to an armed force are clear.
For one thing, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was nearly excommunicated during the last month’s failed coup.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly treated him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic package has been difficult, especially the ban on flights that normally carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish border each year.
The figure has been estimated at nearly 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local passengers and air carriers are certainly comfortable as the flights continue.
They're hoping for a later season to cross the Mediterranean.
And this week, the state TV has predicted worse fruit and hatreds after the re-authorization of agricultural products from Turkey.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as in the Vedemost's report.
But the visit also had a political added value to Moscow.
There is a problem in the Western world about what is considered weak in response to the government’s attempt to eliminate them.
As this is added for a long time with a beautiful rise in the early EU accession negotiations, Putin is eager to take advantage of the tension and to strengthen Turkey's ties to the western countries.
Russia’s leader, apparently received comments from Ankara, where he called on the authorities appointed after the government company to support them.
The fact is that this is the experience of Moscow with its deep concern for the exchange of power.
So this meeting at the beach in the sea resort enabled Russia and Turkey to bring together the "external alliance", as one analyst described me: two countries experiencing the rejection of them and dealing with them wrongly, combining their powers.
However, these two have great differences in public consent.
The opening ceremony is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed on the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be very interesting that after the three-hour discussions started, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question regarding their differences when Putin again chose to raise them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground with Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the opportunity to complete the disaster in Nato-Turkey under Russian control, it is certainly better that the two leaders are still on the ground.
Royal Bank of Scotland All customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's supplier, the RBS brand is transferred back to the office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland loses its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the international objectives of the bank.
After nearly eight years had passed and it had to be saved, the bank had given up these objectives.
Bank strategies have now used the RBS product label to protect other consumer funding barriers.
It supported millions of national sports sponsorships, six Nations-rugby by Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered to be the right thing to give more national brands to the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish customers, but it does not start again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references to the main office and supply lists, except for NatWesti, are converted into NatWesti.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used by the customers of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwana was challenged by customers and staff in the Inverness district.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS product brand will become our employer and employer because we will now become a much more product brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
The RBS has already stated that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship, and it has raised a number of brand profiles to record the sport sponsorship.
"We now have time to move towards the brand bank, as it is basically (we have asked questions) about how we can focus on making this better bank for customers," said the supplier.
Three years ago, I would have been very thirsty if we had said we were going to be a great bank to customers and offered these brands.
But because of what we've done for customers, we don't own it, I believe you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Detor wins in Newmarket with Predelection and wins 3000
The detachment triggers the attack after he has a total of 3000 winnings
The founder of the company, Frankie Dettor, assured his 3,000-year-old Brittany in Newmarket.
On the other night, he won his victory at his home during his competition with John Gosden in preparation for Predelection.
At 45 years of age, an Italian is six jocky that achieves this virtan-pillar contest.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggotty, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
A three-time Masteryocky Detor who won earlier in Ghayyar said, "This is special."
I'm very sensitive because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this has happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular holiday and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The detective will admire himself when he picks up the Predillection after the victory.
Two contestants have been able to win this wart in this series of field competitions - Masteriericky Richard Johnson and retired 20-year-old Master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had predicted more than 4300 winnings in the war.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 winning
Frankie is one of the best contestants of the present time, and it is not surprising that he has reached this peak, which has only recently been reached before him.
He's nice and strong, but his tactical mind doesn't separate him from the other room.
He's been a great way to send competitions, his enthusiasm and his charismatics have had fans of some sort for years.
I told France a few weeks ago in Epsom that he'd been riding 6000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big cats jocky!
Deeply spoken, Frankie has won most of the 30 years in Iso-British, which has to be seen.
He's a living person who's a good thing for British competition, but he's also an incredible jocky.
Frankie Dettor has been celebrating the summer summer season with a brand-made plane landing on the satellite.
From flight termination to flight landings, Frankie Dettor has been the growth of British competition for two decades.
This has been a mountain store.
He was used to win in large cases, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' fight in Ascot in 1996, but he would also survive aircraft accidents and suffer from a competitive drug.
Three years later, he had difficulty returning to his home after six months of competition, but he showed an important nature when he challenged the skeptics and returned to the best of his ability.
And he may still go on for a long time - Detor has already said that he would like to continue the competition for at least 50 years.
Russian Putin separates the president Sergei Ivanov
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been surprised by the fact that Sergei Ivanov has been elected president.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's internal borders for many years.
At 63 years of age, he has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said that Putin "has planned to leave Ivanov to take over the duties of the presidential administration of Russia", but this has not been given a reason.
The Vice-President of Ivanov has been appointed to his successor since 2012, Anton Vaino.
Vaino, 44, is an old diplomat.
He was born in the capital city of Viron in Tallinn in 2012, was produced by an estimated Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (now).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your action as Head of State, which will be governed by the creation of laws and the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had been asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be named after him.
Are smiles reassuring?
This is a business that's surprised Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, the Security Service of the Council in the KGB.
As president, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a public television interview with President Putin, both men claimed that the presidential supervisor had withdrawn his own request.
But in spite of the smile on cameras, only a few of them have been secured here, especially now, just before parliamentarians.
But is this just a trace of some kind of government?
No one knows yet.
However, the official claim that a man once mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, even if he wants to take the lead in Russia's environmental policy, has been taken seriously.
In his comments on the Kremlin website, Putin Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012, I asked you in the debate to give me four years in response to this very complicated, perhaps even to say your job, the task.
Well, now I've been in office for about four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the task in December 2011.
He used to serve as a Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former Member State security service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
By the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy president.
When Putin got up in power, he mentioned Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could come to Russia after President Putin's second term because Put's third term would have been against the foundation.
However, this task went to another Putin's closest associate, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Of course, only three and a half years later, the Prime Minister came to his office.
Criminal Minds, Uncle Thomas Gibson got his leg hit by a producer.
Gibson's been involved in a physical contest in Los Angeles last month.
A number of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, reported his separation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, presented by Gibson, presented an apology to the solicitor before his release was announced.
There were natural differences and gaps in the picture.
I don't think it happened," she said in her opinion.
According to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson’s failure to remove from the FBI's team list are expected later.
Dharma & Greg has been involved in the series since 2005 at the age of 54.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it all over the past twenty years," Gibson said in his spring opinion.
I've been hoping to be with you for the rest of my life, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the exhibitors, our incredible working group, and above all the best fans that can be found in the series.
The start of the two-year production plan is scheduled for 28 September.
Mysteries ended up in Banffi's garden
The man in Banffy has asked for help to identify fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windmills that have left the lake behind.
The Bay, located some 500 metres from the sea, would publish a film material in Periscope with the hope that someone would be able to find out about two thousand tons of fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Silta now rides Fifeen
1.35 billion red projects are expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have joined Queensferry in the north-west and the ground, which means that it is now up to the Five.
It is the first of the four pathways between "cansills" which are now preparing for each of the three rounds.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There's 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 needed.
A total of 1.35 billion red projects are expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the country today and was in the first group on his way from the country to the country.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's upper room.
We are witnessing all the truly effective engineering in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this building."
Despite the great composition and pressure of the seal, the finalisation of the link between the ground and the stillness is a necessary operation in which the dimensions of the maximum accuracy are to be met together.
Nearly 79% of all the oil spills are now on site and due to your last share of concrete being lied in Rosyth today, which means that your whole people are ready to stand on the ground.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure of any bridge project is always significant.
In this fantastic project, this castle represents the height of construction technology.
When the last part of the line had been set up and combined with a wide-ranging northern line, we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. from the inside side.
This was done by pushing the north bank of the land 700 miles south.
This was a major and at the same time a very necessary measure.
Powerful because the land is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tons and has to be transported in about 3 % of the volume.
It is necessary, since the permitted non-exemptions that the team worked were small, only a few millimetres in the direction of each.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation Moelfre Baylla: Three men are "the lucky ones alive"
Three men are "happy when they're alive" after they broke their fishing blood in front of England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued a warning at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the team saw the event on Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to take refuge in their vehicle on their own.
"We saw the men running around the sea and we imagined the worst," said Mr. Vince Jones of the Moelfren rescuer.
"Well, the strong wind had cleaned it away from them until we got to the move," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found armed with a gun without a lifeboat.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue pool and brought back to the rescue pool.
Jones said: "These three men must be happy when they are alive and totally harmless.
The train had a fatal accident, but it was somehow separated from the old man when the train fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go should be respected for the healthy and happy forest
It's hard to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching them.
Pokémon Go allows people to get up from the top of the net and participate in some activity.
The show time was limited to the original TV, then to video games, and recently to computer phones.
It is therefore possible to see that technology and external activity do not close each other.
It is of course referred to as Pokémon Go. The application based on hammocks developed in the early 1990s by video games (later, there were cross-sections, games cards and other products).
As many pop cultures have shown, its recommendation was somewhat distorted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the publication of the game was released in other countries because of the great popularity of overcrowding services.
In just days, Pokémon Goll had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Players described in the box are using their cell phone to search for Pokémones that are followed by GPS and which can be "photo" (by phone call call) or "demand".
A schoolgirl who played the game as a young man has joined the band and jumped up with the search engine.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily average rate.
Apple Watch’s Cardiogram application, which followed 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days, the number of people who moved in 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent in Cardiogram’s follow-up.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it's just seeing practice data.
The calls of many public health campaigns "find 30", "new spring" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are quiet and interfering with people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of movement cannot be reduced.
Regular movements have a lower risk of foodborne disease or dementia.
Activities contribute to weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too many.
Pokémon Gon's beauty is that it can get people out and do something they enjoyed.
In this way, three health pills are covered: movement, air and solar surfaces as well as dust.
Some people even get new friends in their forest.
As is usually the case, the sad characters are looking for things to choose.
Yeah, someone can walk through the door.
What about it?
There's been a murder.
Although there were previously applications like Fitbiti that could be monitored for activity, they did not give rise to movement in the same way as this game.
Renewal failure will disappear and use will be postponed.
However, as a result of the success of the pokémon, other games that combine applications and virtualization will help many foresters to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Billes made gold in the formation of women's strength
Forget the pressure.
Forget the public court.
Simone Billes is immune to it all.
It's in the elevators of energy.
It's a soft tree.
I can't believe it.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics.
At 19 years of age, an American power plant gained formation by leaving itself and the end of the world in the light of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than that of Hope Aly Raisman and Russian Prossimist Aliya Mustafin.
At the United States level level, Simone Billes, in the final year of the formation of women's telecoms, in the autumn of 2016 in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro tortoise.
The fourth American woman who has succeeded in mastering the formation and all five U.S. masters came from the bus. At the same time she encouraged to mention her family, and at the same time, as the best of all times.
He rested on the couch when his final score was announced, and his long journey to this point ended.
This achievement raises his same class of other generation's best players, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Billes has ruled the class for the last three years by winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold, programs that have been so surprising that in 1984, Olympic teacher Mary Lou Retton called him "the best I can see as a power player".
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so between Billes and other competitors but between his and the expectations of the majority.
The return of the family to Texas Springs without a curious cult would have been a disappointment.
The U.S. Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, wish to win the gold and hopeamateil (in this order) in the finals of the formation of women's telecoms in Brazil in 2016 in the autumn of Rio de Janeiro, tortoise.
Billes arrived at the first debate on Tuesday when he was working as the coordinator of the national team, Martha Karolyn, on the move.
Although Billes claimed that he had never thought about the future when he walked for some time into a trap, it is not completely realistic.
Part of his permanto programme - which includes his trademark of voltification - has been adapted to Latin American music, which also became part of the road to the Rion Olympics.
This isn't gonna hurt.
Of this girl whose grandmother was adopted as a daughter, and her mother found Aimee Boorman's mother when the girl was on an uneducated island where Boorman was prepared, she became a power worker.
He has not been destroyed in the formation after the summer of 2013, and this victory will continue as long as Billes wants.
Although Mustafin was small after two rounds, it was just ridiculous.
The balance sheet and permanence in which Billes is the world's dominant master were expected.
He stood on the top of the tree, 15,433 and over, with 15,933 feet.
Raisma liked him very well when they waited for the finals - just the form - and the cries came up to Billes with white and blue-bound eyes when he wrote his playbook once it came true.
Raisman’s performance was some sort of reflection of four years back when he was divided into a third place, but destroyed the province of Mustafin in the new one.
This time, at the age of 22, a group leader who Americans call "my mother" was clearly responsible.
He sent flights to the public after his permantogram, a request to be heard at the airport, which had an impact on the audience.
As far as Billes is concerned, this 19-year-old spread of Twitter this week will have a very new significance:
Police: Three victims were shot in a row while they listened to music in the car
In the last ten years of the first serial killer attack, two women and 12-year-old girls were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in the car on June 12.
The information tells us that the driver's side of the car would shoot up to eight times and then take another walk.
According to the police, the third death did not affect the outcome of the robbery because the attacker did not bring handcuffs or other adult casualties of $2900.
Colonel Jonathan Howard, a representative of the Phoenix police, said that the bombing had enabled researchers to check if it was related to four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two have been injured during nine attacks during the four months of the attack, which has been carried out in two main Latin American cities.
"They're happening in the residential area in front of the house," Howard said earlier this month to KBS's subsidiary KKHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of walking routes such as the end of the 1990s, Nissania, the end of the 1990s, the Black BMW and the White Cadillacia or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence leading to the conclusion that attacks are related to each other and are the same killer.
Ellis, 33 C.E., was sent to a hospital where he later died because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The observer told the police that they often sat in the parking lot listening to music in the car.
The authorities would also publish an explosion of police information, which took place only half an hour before the end of the third century, and the purpose of which was to empty an open package, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers have found fossils, natural sittings, and natural circuits of motorists.
My 6-year-old mother, who is sick, says, "Your life is getting easier."
Edmund Picciuta, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves music, music and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small, this is the result of the genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuta, didn't know when he was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my employer was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise you that.
Which isn't true at all. I'm sure I promised," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund would never have to learn to identify them and that he would not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that she be placed in hospital care.
"Energy was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuta explained.
Edmund's on his way through the walkway.
Edmund didn't sit or steal until he was three years old, and he doesn't speak yet.
But he'll soon get some whists.
He's going to walk as an assistant and walk on a golf course.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows how the reference to Edmund's discovery refers to "do you sing to me".
"Let's teach him a language of reference," Piccito told CBS News.
But there's no common reference mechanism in this case - he says that Edmund has found some of his own references.
Microbephaly may lead to a number of reasons: genetically, as in the case of Edmund, or chronic viral infections such as tuberculosis or Zika virus.
The symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of Zika sufferers.
Picciuta remembers the emotional burden of the uncertain future.
I was just wondering what's gonna happen.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't really know yet.
I haven't actually asked you to predict the time, because I don't expect anyone to be able to really give me that.
But Picciutus has a good advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects from Zika.
It's going to be easier.
You can believe your situation will improve.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Banks and arrivals caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Banks and wide distributions came to Louisiana to announce to the governor during the summer of the emergency. More than a hundred days were expected for the State.
The National Weather Service reported that many people in the coastal part of Louisiana and southern Mississippi had come over their islands and caused large quantities of heavy rains.
The Government of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the authorities of the country are continuing to contact the local authorities and that aid is already coming to the necessary areas.
Mike Steele, representative of the Security and Emergency Protection Agency of the Governor, said they would receive requests from the waterways, the waterways and the coastal areas.
Steele said that alone, the Tangapaho district required tens of thousands of cookies.
The future will be in force on Sundays to a large part of the south of Louisiana.
In the opinion of the Board of Governors, the region is expected to have more than three-five cents more.
In southern Alabama, the spring was in force during the spring, when thousands continued in the Mobil area.
Both of them are located near Baton Rougen's Committee and near Denham Springs' Amite's, located in Louisiana, and were predicted during the weekend.
Engineer Alek Krautmann said that both could come to many houses in the urban areas near Baton Rougen.
He also said that the threat was the return of an Ascension border on the west coast of Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw Jockfaw, which is located in the southern part of the state of Mississippi, was at the highest level of all times on Friday morning at nine.
The rescuers were still killing people from coming water in Amita and Wilkinson's coastal area in the late Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and his son were in the closet of Glosteria's rescue team.
At 62 years of age, Hansford says that normally more than 400 horses off the coast of Beaver Creek, located in his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another boy near him warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It's been all night.
The wife of Hansford told her husband that she had never seen a well of water so high during the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford said that both he and his family members are all wrong, and that he's the only one who's weird.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved three of them in a large, friendly truck of soldiers and took them to Gloster's station, where they were rescued in the evenings.
Krautmann says that the arrivals "will spread rapidly" over the course of the run-offs and that the authorities are planning evacuation regulations.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 million hours between midnight and spring.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely exhausted from midweek to continuing to run.
The return of banks and ceilings leads to the rescue of residents of the Tangapaho region from the codes and the introduction of education in the fifth school district, the authorities reported.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the municipal authority in Tangapaho said that 200 homes were left behind.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now coming down.
The president of the coastal community, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 loved ones who had stayed on the islands of the river.
The cities of Amiten and Hammond have been opened to those who have been evacuated.
"They'll be able to return to their homes when the water starts to sink," he said.
In Hammond, a village in the county of Tanganyika, the town of Hammond was closed because of a rise in water, and the inhabitants were able to take short steps to try to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last great come here was in March," said the city's management authority Lacy Landrum.
This is a similar case in the future.
In Mississippi, President Rupert Lacy of Harrison's Regional Emergency Department said that the fair hundred went on along the coast of Mexico.
He said that a massive house in Torstana was told to come, but on the other hand, no incoming aid has been reported.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopr Value Foods, who is in the Amiment, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and hundreds continue."
"Showcases" was six-year-old Mahaj Brown surviving Philadelphia's bombing
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shooting in the cities this week.
The oldest of his children told CBS Philadelphia his name is Mahaj Brown.
The elders say Brown got a lot of shots, including noses, legs, hands and arms, but he was unconscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little guard was full of trust," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the location.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition is critical, and he has several seizures.
The family's gonna tell her she's gonna be waiting for her to make a move.
The boy was starting the first class at the local college.
Brown was one of four shots on the Germantown card.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One 29-year-old man was reported in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found on the front of a car shot together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the situation reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the men who were wounded could have been shot.
The researchers repeat to CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a crackdown between several gunmen.
The types of attacks that were originally different from the attacks were filled with an incident site.
It seems that there was no further fight on this matter.
On the road, there was a ladder to walk on both sides of the road.
"It seems that there were several armed fighters here and that they were active in the fight," said the police officer of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi.
A number of houses and roads in the area also received supplies.
The arrests have not been carried out and according to the data received, the police have been investigating the crews of the Navy.
The second six - year - old girl was given a piece of candy in her hand when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's in a meeting, and the police are still looking for suspects.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurieta?
So I call this year's Olympic Women's Force for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been on every summer vacation since 1984, and the United States has never been so ruling.
And secondly, there are three powerful men here, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this group, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, is all high.
This group looks like, finally, from America.
It has also been confirmed by the kind of involvement of women in the dark and Latin American world.
In the last four years, the successful female strength of women has been an American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised to be an Olympic champion, and America was rocked.
Now the world has been able to testify to the incredible achievements of the three world masters Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in which they present unexpected but masterly programmes of power.
In Torstane, Simone became the fourth American woman who has successfully won an individual in the formation of women.
And teammate Aly Raisman got fired.
We see this kind of increase, but the situation does not appear in these powers in different parts of the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie went all the same way when Aly and Madison reached the Olympics.
They are "Final Five" because in the next Olympic team there will be only four players, and this is Martha Karolyn's last year as a candidate.
The reality is, however, that enforcement is a expensive type, and it is usually practiced by the executives in private performance clubs that maintain the parents who pay the preparation, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for manufacturers and their owners and families) and the list continues.
Most of these power clubs are located in poor urban areas that can support species.
These clubs get all their preparations, and this is a precious and long-term commitment to the families of the players.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Billes' maker, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's producer, have both been preparing their players since they started the operation.
We need to bring more and more effective and available force preparation to communities where there are numerous young girls from Simon, Gabby and Laurie.
20 years ago, I founded my power plant.
In my series we have provided free and successful enforcement in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and have prepared national and international sailors.
In September we extend to Detroit (home town) a high level of power to young people who are able to learn and benefit from this significant Olympics.
The strengths develop the body's strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as its sense of urgency, creativity and determination.
This system provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work.
This group's inspiration will start with thousands of young girls, and it's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
We're living in a very exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing how to take "girl power" seriously by winning the Olympic team, and that you motivated so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
In order to organise new laws, doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the urgent changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the members of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the doctors involved in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to force the contract to say that NHS was "inland unknown" and that there were few extra side effects on individuals and patients.
The first doctors shall be transferred to a new contract containing changes to the working methods of the night and weekends to improve treatment during the hours of work.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Doctors, said last night in his opinion: "The doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it accelerates the current labour crisis and that it does not affect all doctors equally."
Before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement, only eight weeks are left, progress must be made and time between the end.
BMA's companies have been faced with a lack of participation by the government through negotiations and with a deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, remove the burden and take into account the concerns of the medical professionals.
If he doesn't, the doctors are ready to continue working.
Finally, at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100 000 response hours were performed when nurses and consultants were colored into the place of doctors in lacquering.
The ministers had hoped that they would be able to put an end to the urgent changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the members of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekly loan with 54 000 medical doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the employer of NHS Employees, invited doctors not to go to jail.
Mortimer said: "The employees get very little or nothing, but they place stress on the themes and services already ready to be prepared, and cause anxiety, anxiety and stress to patients, caregivers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have successfully responded to the role of the Guardian Role and the Whistleblowing.
The employers were hopeful that the continued positive discussion on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, retraining, cost-additional training, recognition of both the educational programme and gender wage education - is a sign of how serious workers, the Health Education England Education Organization and the Ministry of Health are respecting the agreements reached with Marras, Hammer and May BMA.
Two pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart failure
Dental heart disease patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription, ticagrelor, increases the risk of recent events in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after heart attack in order to reduce the risk of brain damage or other adverse events.
NHS supervisors have advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of heart and blood problems.
But now NHS's supervisors have advised that it should be given to people for four years so that they can still take the risk of heart and blood problems.
About 140,000 people get heart attacks each year in England, and a fourth of them get second or brain damage.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a walled fatty substance that forms an aches.
If you have a seizure, it may cause a bleeding disorder that prevents your heart from bleeding.
If the injection is released, it can travel with blood and cut the blood vessels into the brain by causing brain damage.
People who have already had one encounter are at risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by AstraZeneca Isoratian company and sold by Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely to waste.
Today’s publication of the NACE manual recommends that humans receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for a 12-month period followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective advanced treatments, even four-quarters of people with heart disease will later receive another heart attack or brain attack, which is often disastrous."
The fear of recovery can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, together with aspirin, is effective to calculate the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had heart failure.
When we initially proposed ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to thousands of people who benefit from these treatments.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly on the risk of blood year, are limited over three years, the guidance document does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows for election in Muslim areas
The former President of the Tower of Hamlet was removed from office in the last year because of corruption by contributing to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that the broad spectrum of vote in Muslim communities has been taken into account, as reflected in today's shocking government report.
The former government minister Sir Eric Pickles appointed police, electoral and municipal authorities because they took note of the evidence of the electoral "extreme of religion and religion".
The former Community secretary, current anti-corruption emperor, said that the fear of voters on a religious basis is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guard tickets outside the polling stations to protect those who are afraid of voting.
He recommends that voters present a personal certificate in order to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter should be placed in a non-destructible black box so that no one can vote twice.
The publishers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He asked the press to increase access to the documents and decisions of the Authority by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against elections, but would protect local government from more corruption and economic corruption from cultures that walk hand in hand with the electorate," he said.
The government sent a report on the outcome of the polling calendar of the Eastern Tower of Hamlet.
Last year, the Special Court decided that the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court of Justice stated the religious feelings of Rakhman "probably mistaken" in his Muslim community, as well as his late fellow condolences on racism and the role of Islam.
The group is said to be "leading its election campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
At least 300 votes were accountable or resulting from one vote to another.
Sir Eric said the evidence material was found in the field.
He expressed particular concern at the vote of the electorate in which members of the high-value Muslim community were said to force people to vote on their election.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the identification of personality evidence
In his report, he said: "The evidence was presented that certain members of the ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were forced to vote in accordance with the will of the older communities, in particular those with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that...the State institutions had taken note of this use of 'politically correct' due to the overcrowding of religion and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals to clean up the system, which included the refusal of political activists to deal with post-posted voting rights in order to end the "vote group".
The report under review by Theresa May also requires more stringent amendments to registers in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and reimbursement.
Check options for the identity of the voters before the vote.
Use a non-destructible black to hold a voter's ring so that no one can vote twice.
Make sure that they have the right to vote.
Set the limit of three years to the request for an automatic post vote.
To prevent political activists from being dealt with through the mail, voice and letter boxes where the votes are sent.
Let the police put guard tickets around the polling stations.
Other laws so that it is easier to blame people for their fear on the basis of the People Act 1983.
Create a photo at the voting sites.
It requires that only English (except Wales) be used in voting places.
Strengthen your training so that you can ensure that the staff adhere to the rules that allow the voter to go to each other alone.
Sir Eric is telling the Great London police authorities that it's "unfortunate" that no crime has been raised after the attack by the Tower Hamlets.
"As a result of the numerous acts of corruption and illegal acts of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
On the basis of a number of grounds, he was found guilty without any doubt, according to the criminal prosecution.
He also criticised the ineffective "study of red checks" in the municipal authorities' voting registers.
Sir Eric said, "The Court of the Tower of Hamlets has been resurrected in the last year.
Our nation has a wonderful heritage as the founder of parliaments, but this is a concern and a secretive extension of the electoral system and the refusal of certain groups of facts threatens this good reputation."
Leather of Kate's bike bikes and other pictures of other publications on the Rion Olympics
This week in the Olympics, fans Rion 2016 have gone from a rather French biker from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be a powerful two-way passenger in Cambridge.
But at the age of 24, the Olympics aren't really the only modern gold fighter who can fight with his famous two-year-old, at least according to social media.
So, for the honour of the Rio cheeses and all the famous plants that we are currently dealing with, the FC has drawn up a list of Olympics that clearly appear from Hollywood's publications.
Forestryer and brother: A member of the U.S. team of men, Brady Ellisoni, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's two-wheeled flight, many people on the network have been quick to note how one particular frequency could be star Leonardo DiCaprio.
In the United States, a band of men, Mr. Brady Ellison, has caused a massive tweet after the surface of his pictures, where he appears to be frightened just as The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the social media rush, the speaker admitted that he had been from childhood to see Leo.
"I don't see a great deal of unity in myself, except maybe a few," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a pretty good guy, so it's because this is a treatise."
One of the most popular comparisons from London since 2012 is probably also going up this year: the sudden uniformity of Britain's long-term champion Greg Rutherford and the recommended actor between Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian mighty Allya Mustafina is said to be the great, visible sight of the present-day American singer Gloria Estefan.
And down down from South Africa, Uncle Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to the Glee of Matthew Morrison for many years.
Insomnia: From this user's point of view, Nathan is the "song version" of the Inception exhibition
The second long-term comparison has been between Lieutenant Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong wings and voices.
Russia's Hope Amateur Yulia Efimovalla is another example of Annalynne McCord and her skin and choice of support when Nathan Adrian again reminds the U.S. team of fans "Joseph Gordon Levitt's funny version".
Heavy Women: Football Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter Indicator Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same growth form and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very interested in seeing other similarities as well
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there can be a reason for a couple of similarities
One Twitter user objected to the fact that "some people on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. football team and Dexter's exhibitor have truly incredible growth patterns and sights.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jengings and his smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile is exactly bringing It On to Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC’s Olympian Commentary presents an apology to the Chinese husband for "death as well as death"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200-metre-free message of women’s 4x200 metre was based on CBC’s direct olympics.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its sponsors said during the crisis at 14 years of age "lost as a bad mood" and "dead as you do".
Historian Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was gone when he began to share some of his own thoughts in the women's 4x200-metre-free media.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's salons to bring "colour," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
It's too intense, it's as bad as a smell, it's dead as a cat.
Thank you for that."
Chinese Emperor Ai Yanhan, 14, announced at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds later than Canada Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to arrest China.
Observers around Canada reacted rapidly to the use of the language and its severity on the network.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did CBC's salesman just say that when China was 14 years old, her husband 'died like a cat'???
The idiot didn't realize that he was still in direct transmission."
China Ai Yanhani was described in a 4 x 200-metre newspaper: "That little 14-year-old from China, baby."
The discussion against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was very, very slow and fast when many challenged him.
Twitter users didn't like themselves when they heard what Byron MacDonald was like.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you can all listen to us about the race race race.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who was presenting CBC's letter, asked for an immediate apology for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the review had to be sent.
In this matter there was to be a vote, we are sorry that this has happened."
CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had been tweeted in response to comments.
Scott Russell had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that CBC copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had chosen MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published an opinion.
We are deeply sorry that these opinions were made and that they were sent to the front.
Yesterday night we quickly joined the measures and asked for a direct apology for our views and our follow-up to the social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the U.S.U., not his personality.
However, this was not an acceptable and must be a sad choice, and Byron is very sorry to say it.
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized in a direct letter and tried to define his comment by ensuring that he did not intend to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to ask for an apology at this moment, which I made last night after the women's message," he said in the letter of the Olympics to the CBC.
"I've called to make my wife, not her person."
"It would be unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be embarrassing and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was kidnapped by a woman who strongly agreed to the ship's clothes in the middle of the trade
The customers didn't know what to look at when a woman got enough in the middle of Primark's business to try basic issues.
It did not improve matters until, after assessing what she looked like in her lips, a woman threw them out of her head and put them back into her pocket.
He continued his tour and finally agreed to four base-houses on the market, which was located in Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkeston.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkeston, where the woman agreed on basics and then put them back in the restroom
At the same time, Jenny Davidson’s mother, who had two children at the same time, said that after she had tried to prove her clothes, a woman secretly "was dressed again and walked away without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe in their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the shop at Lattania, took up the pairs of boots, washed her hands and armpits, and laid her hands on her feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secret place for reconciliation; he just stood there as a shame."
"They all laughed when he again took off his boots and obviously didn't like them because he put them back in the backyard."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided that he didn't want to see anything, got dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who looked or thought about people who decided to buy the basics he agreed on."
At the age of 33, Davidson, in the city of Kent, said: "I have to think that someone will bring home the basics that someone has tried, but which have not been cleaned."
The emergency took place on Tuesday night.
Davidson added: "I found out that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing pockets from the sale of a woman, which is very good."
"It would be a shame to go home with new ships and find that another woman has dressed them and took them away, and they are not dirty."
The representative of the Primark said: "Primmark is a known event that took place in the movement of Folkeston on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This allows you to defend against armed attacks using Krav Magaa
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Mr. Rhon Mizrachin of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to explain how to deal with persistent robbers in the neighborhood.
You were then approached from the front or back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrachi, if you're approached back, first you have to turn to see your attackers and "fly the fire".
Then hit the gun between the trigger and the middle of the gun before the shots attack the plants free of charge.
Continue to shoot at the bows, and when the enemy goes into the abyss, turn your sword against him, and strike him after the sword, and take away the sword that is in his hand.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the fireline, shoot your gun and turn it around so that the criminal can't get rid of it.
Put the gun at the same time and shoot the attacker on the wall, then turn the gun on his shoulder, turn back and show him the gun.
Can you hear me?
From the video, see how Mizrachi does this exactly.
But remember, if you're not Master Krav Magan, the safe way to get out of the robbery situation is to get rid of your money.
Traveller Ian Wright takes the most expensive places in Europe for travel
The British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and toxin reflexes by taking some of Europe’s most fragile and most destructive places.
Ian Wright, 51, a native driver and traveler from Sufffolski, would be a non-eurocellian, a fugitive in Piccadilly Circux, a fireplace in the jungle, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before any delay, he used a camera to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experience of the film following the Internal Power led to amazing results.
The idea of the release of thousands of people of the same sex can be completely contradictory, but in fact there are even more bad bacteria in the kitchen yard.
On the way, European brother Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening dental bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing in his life left him in the wrong mood.
Wright became known as a steadfast tester when he traveled around the world and ate strange and amazing things.
This task for protecting public railway stations for the Wc trainer was indeed tested by his immune system.
In the film he said, "From childhood I've been quite concerned about my health, and I've put my mouth on all kinds of things from my mouth, my stomach and my fucking water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a clean Russian public toilet.
In his show, there were more than 4,000 reading units in the camera.
As a result of the comparison, the number of counter-attached hands should be less than 60.
But in a certain Russian public service, he did not agree to resign when the photometric output appeared to be more than 4,000 units, and the corresponding output is less than 60.
Wright has produced a passenger film, following internal power, together with a Finnish miner, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film he said, "This is the worst thing I've ever done on the wc."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to waste anything because there's a night here.
After entry into force, they were produced together with a Finnish miner, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefil, which contains dairy sugar bacteria as well as vitamins C and D that help to strengthen human reproductive bacteria and immune systems.
"We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and that would explain the advantages of the probiet.
We blew out a lot of crazy ideas, and we decided to "call Ian."
They claim that interest in healthy health is a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: tell the archipelago about good and bad bacteria, the importance of reproductive health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in volunteer health is a global phenomenon, and this document will help us to tell consumers more in an interesting way.
In my opinion, the document also shows that we have a great tumor!
The director of the document Tom Hakala added: "May it be said now even so: if Ian had lost some of the things I asked him to do, as shown in the film about the Russian night walk, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of these things were easier for Ian when they were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've got some of these dirty secrets saved."
In the 2015 election, 84% of respondents jointly named dairy sugar bacteria as fat and sweetened, and 58% said that they are at least between products which have been added to dairy sugar bacteria.
The family destroyed the apartment in Cornwall Saltashi before the decision.
The apartheid caused $50,000 in damages to the renter after they were banned because of the terrorist attacks of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been fired out of Cornwall Saltashi's apartment since they had been selected for numerous reports.
When they were most powerfully removed from the holding, the affected operators of the housing company claimed that they were in good condition.
The walls had been made of hollow doors, lattice windows had been repaired, waste had been spread to the floor, and walls had been destroyed by graffiti.
The family has now changed to others, and they are believed to be in private housing.
Conna McEvoy, Chairman of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a terrible burden on the people, and I don't think people should have to live this way.
There are many reasons why this facility is likely to be identified by less suitable Cornwall groups.
This family is a bad thing, and their name is a bad thing."
In Paris, there were three boys living between the buildings, and according to the police, the family’s fear was to include covert fires, fear of neighboring residents, drug use, drug sales and general screaming, argumentation and surgery.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision on non-social use in June.
Many of the rooms in the basement of the house were abandoned.
The building, which had previously been covered with drugs, the latrines were broken up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen on the street fighting and that the police were regularly called on the spot.
Cornwall House decided to force a woman and this partner's stability this week given them a longer period of time, 11 weeks, to change the time freely.
The oppressed neighbors were grateful for the decision to say that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived with them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen police here so many times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's beautiful now that they're gone."
Mr. Cornwall Hosing's Deputy Executive Director, Adam Fitzpatrick, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the apartment.
Roskia and old toys have been thrown down to the villa wall.
He added: "I stated that the dwelling did not take any responsibility for its own and family use, since the decision is always the last procedure to consider Cornwall Hosing.
This was a very difficult case because the use was excellent, and their actions must have frightened neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as the courageous, informed us of the work of the members of the Community.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the apartment at different times, but they were all twelve.
An empty bag left on the floor of one bedroom after the crash
Residential workers must now clean the house around the house
In 2014, the police built a railway station and found more than 70 g of canvas and cattle, supplies and 1700 pounds per hand.
Skeldo was granted the reasons for his liability for distributing the drug under the control of category B.
He said that money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's grave water. This died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners are now left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had been destroyed by graffiti.
The police say they're trying to get rid of the residents who think they're paying for the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall said the decision was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to observe the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their use is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such practice," he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never resort to criminal and antisocial use, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our community.
Travelers in Portugal were alarmed when their army flew down the coast of the hippo.
Astrologers in Portugal Aveiro experienced a breakdown in their lives
Portugal's P-3C Orion Airport would be closed down from the ground.
The Air Force said there was a training event in this case and claimed that safety was not a threat
Right now, the frightened tourists began to wonder when the lower airway would clean up the whole coast.
The drama shows how the military aircraft came close to contacting North Portugal's Aveiro, a small coastal town in northern Portugal.
The performers stood up when they began to be clearly concerned about the metal of sugarcane, even though they did not first see what kind of security it was coming upon them.
The event took place last night in Costa Nova, near Aveir.
One of the numerous musicians who would publish videos of dramatic social unrest was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It ended up two really low, and at the same time it seemed like it was eating on the ground."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was in the surfing and really felt like the machine was falling on me."
Travelers on the coast of Aveiro were in danger when the plane appeared from dark clouds and landed at an incredible landing.
The authorities of Portugal said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft was operating on an operating plane which was intended to identify fishing vessels near the coast, and that the aircraft was to land so low that it was the only way to check the vessels.
He said that your refrigerator had been quite normal underground because of the bad visibility of nearby farms, but the air force assured that no one was in danger.
This summer, the national parks have destroyed parts of Manner-Portuguese, and in addition, four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese authorities said today that the aircraft had to fly under the light of the adverse conditions, the drought caused by the earthquake and the heavy rain caused by the earthquake.
The aircraft was operating on a flight and part of the flight was requested to be identified by fishing vessels
The outcome of the first half of Exocs is better expected
The South Karjal Social and Health Framework (Exote) created a January - a better result of EUR 3.4 million planned in June.
The surplus result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has enabled the establishment to be replaced.
The treatment was carried out in all operations.
Exote has tried to reduce the scope of the measure this year.
Exotics are covered by excess of pre-born subordinates.
More than that, it may be used to reduce side effects and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better planned.
The Exegetical Government shall consider the mid-year report at its meeting first Wednesday.
Seventy-seven Special Doctors swore by the military officer in Immol
Seventy-seven men from the border and maritime insurance school swore by the military during the holidays.
In Immol, the military force of the armed forces of the coastal and maritime schools was organized during spring.
The holiday season for the Tenth Special Doctors was organized by the sports industry.
The army took 70 men.
Specialist doctors shall be trained in cross-border security, information and combat activities.
They're serving 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were asked to serve as special surgeons.
They were called 250.
Specialist doctors have been trained in Immol since 2007.
In the context of the anti-fraud regime, the veterinary treatment involved five wartime groups.
The average age of those who were involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the occasion were born in 1918.
Cross-border fraud - crime reporting helps to resolve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police institutions, RTA has been active since 2014 as a crime investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outside.
There are four police officers in the Hammeen City and Lahde police unit.
It'll lead to the Supreme Court of Lath.
Commissioner Lahde shall act as chairman.
In addition, the unit's strength is part of the computerized civilian population in Hämeenlin.
They're all working in civil society.
The Unit has demonstrated its ability to use and its necessity, is considered by the Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppenen.
The RTA unit produces different findings to other police.
In a surprise, it has also acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the new working methods
The establishment of analytical units is a reform of the youth policy working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to make the police go even more rarely to the south than when they receive a warning.
The data collected and analysed by the unit shall focus on daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one crime centre was established, under which three state units and one police unit were established.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the context of the central policy in Vantaa, will conduct its activities in a state-of-the-art manner.
The PTR units work on behalf of the people of the Police, Customs and National Guard.
The RTA units are working in the areas distributed by the police institutions and have to provide information to local police authorities and public authorities.
Information goes outside its own area
Where a private police officer is responsible for what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA must be to know what is happening in the area of the entire police station.
The information also extends beyond the borders of its own institution because it does the same for crime.
The RTA unit has better basic policies.
One is trying to focus on new phenomena, products, or other crimes that remind the police of registers, alerts and findings.
This is called for induction, and it is one of the most important tools for crime education.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The hand is also seen at work, then it was real or criminal.
On the basis of the facts, a certain picture is formed.
Deterioration can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on whether the police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The RTA staff do not drive the goods to the city to be able, but their work is not fully publicized.
Neither of itself nor of the methods of criminal use is reported because it could lead to professional development and thus to the prevention of police crime.
The police will be publicly informed of the procedure if it anticipates the threat posed by them.
For example, the case was from the beginning of a novelty, used in residential buildings to mark dwellings in empty spaces.
It was where the authors set up the apartment on the outside of the boat, the button or the dock where they tried to find out if they were really on the road.
The chairperson shall be at least public.
The analysis has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
For example, they require a protocol on infringement rights, which may indicate that there has been a riot at the site.
The next time we go to the castles, we're gonna get a bunch of hamlets in our hands.
For this reason, the Deputy Police Officer has been questioned by Tero Seppäs Hämeen, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa of the East-Suomen Police, Commissioner Sami Joutjärve Joensuu, and the criminal prosecutor Arto Tuomela of the Central Criminal Police.
The police collected and analysed information that would help to plan practical action.
Reducing labour and funding rates.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation will collect information from its own institution and from outside Finland.
Isis related education from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schools that left London last year to join Isis, has died in Syria as a result of the terrorist attacks.
Specialist Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard of this death in Syria a few weeks ago.
The ITV News reported to Torstana that the girl was believed to be dead in the Russian Air Force Raqana, which is the country's support point.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just as he was planning to get out of the country of war and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of the case is that it can act as an insult and as a testimonial to others that the departure of the war area is associated with real risks - that it could allow people to agree on making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other East-West Educations flew to Turkey, where they went by bus to the Syrian border.
The family of Sultan was told that the girl had been married in Syria with the Isis fighter, and that she had just arrived a few months later.
Reid says that the highest law in the Garland of Clinton is a candidate if he is elected.
Senator Harry Reid says he has been assured that President Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland as the highest right if he is elected President.
The people of the Senate have opposed Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama named him in March.
The president of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president is elected to the position of Mr Anton Scalian, the senior member of the person.
Reid said in his speech to Torstana that he was predicting "someone-way security" that he was elected to the Garland of Clinton.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not talked to Clinton directly about whether he would call Garland and that there was speculation about it.
He called Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "intervene the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who were opposed to the name of Garland are president of the Republican Donald Trump's "crowds" and "movables".
He said Trump didn't apply to the office.
Treats says the calendar is "for women as well as men"
The Treads magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer to publish the 1970s inspired calendar of Pirelli in 2017.
But instead of low-level audiences, they are going to find their next NU Museums calendar of the 2017 World Cup.
President of the Treaty Steve Shaw told us this year that she's got her undercover paper separate from the old school playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this to women.
Apparently he thinks they have a calendar.
"We have to start again with the presentation of thought and classy subjection in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these women's underage images," said Shaw in a press release in which the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can be left via the network or in personalized selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyyl's head: who really buys the leaves?
Single, middle-aged men love wines.
Before you make a comment on the written statements, which are the name of the not-one-one-year-olds, see that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGovin, the new outcome of many of the publications discussed does not result in the increasing number of people born this millennium from the innovation of physical objects, but from the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought grapes are more likely to be 45-54 years.
In fact, all the most unlikely publications are bought by the age group of 18-24 years.
The question is also not only about the collection of harvesters but also about the labelling: the older harvesters are a little more likely to have their own feeling (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoyed a single (69 % vs 66 %).
But do you like the results of youGovin?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was in the middle of a fast-paced bed in Sohos, above me, without any need for a dry blanket. I would look forward to stopping, form a cup of coffee on my hands and say something valuable, like, "Let's figure it out better."
Let's do more research.
At the same time, when Soho’s power and power are slowly removed - hotels, kitchen facilities and shops and office supplies are now filling buildings that used to have self - movement - a huge special feature of the press is still in progress.
For the next part, I would probably ask the camera to stop at the time of drawing when the situation is very close to several men in some of these trades when I try to assess by detecting their age and their awareness of the temperature.
Glassowlinen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (School: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (School: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twelve), spends their evenings in London because of meeting, and rotates businesses to spend a few hours.
I wonder if he's a collector.
"It's me," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 copies.
These sheets that are shown in the picture on him (he sent an e-mail message, I did not follow him home), hide his living room walls.
The reason for this enormous volume and volume acquisition is partly due to the income he is using: now he can buy books that he had no money when he was first published, and he can buy again what he sold when he was young and without money.
"Most of my purchase material is late 60th and early 70th, magazines published when there were 11th or 12th volumes for which I was probably a little too young," he says.
He shares the view that the purchasers are more likely to be introverts who enjoyed their own follow-up, and adds: "I don't burn and I don't drink much.
This is my fault."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of her clients agree to yourGovin profile.
However, he has noticed people in the new area who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the leaves have come back into shape and who have had to buy their old leaves back.
On the basis of my discussions, people have acquired a difference in their overall population in 1998 or 1999.
Customers selling their wines to buy cds now sell their cds to buy their album back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of aged grapes.
But what about the label of the posters?
In the case of phonican, the trade takes a few seconds to realize that the goods offer comfort to the same types of Community.
According to Wezi, some older customers have been particularly disappointed by the nearest payment system.
Some vinyl phosphonates can be absorbed from the digital world and choose the sustainability of their reliable publications; events that reflect the memories of teen-age good days.
"I think there may be times when it may be about filling up the door or some kind of comfort which the ownership of the objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true to many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We are like their social workers!" said another worker immediately.
A dramatic ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50 % of the people who had bought grapes in the previous month had not yet heard of it.
The question also found that 41 % of the products they never use when 7 % of the wines they buy are not available.
In this respect, the news report is likely to show serious concern about the need for new training in this field.
The vision of this resurrection is something that also works in Sounds of the Universe (from three middle-aged men), Jonny, 42, has noticed.
"Some time ago someone came in and said, 'I don't have a radio call, but I want to buy a radio show so we can put it on hold'," she says.
There's no large part of this, but this is what's going to happen.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a radio."
So not parents, but younger people, my late-year-olds, who are just excited about it.
In Foppy, where today’s almost complete store of wines, I have a much more diverse audience.
Seventeen parishes, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Although the air limit is lower than in the above-mentioned movements - to beat the hardwood of Wild Beastin in youth, and it's not a good idea to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been traveling around Foppia for a few minutes looking at the various volumes on sale.
He's doing window jobs, not spending a lot of money.
He doesn't know much about it, so there's really no way out of it.
"It's cute.
It's easy to listen to music on either computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... "she cares dearly.
"I don't know how to explain it-- it's really unique."
My last stop is said to be the generation of new vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I tried to show that I was studying farts, I found a group of teen-age girls who would gather for a moment around the polaroid cameras before Father and daughter based on the purchase of Crossey's radio station.
On the left there is a port with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winheusen and Fleetwood Mac's sheets: the collection of contemporary music and classics, whatever the essential features of the middle school.
No one looks at them-- maybe because they're just scratches, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's just "drinking pills" in this case.
However, given that the small attention given to these items can mean more money to industry and send some customers to ask for more Soho food, there is no choice here.
It is not surprising that the population of others who have more likely time and money is also the one who spends most of their time and money, such as grapes.
But while my findings indicate that youGovin's results are local in at least Soho's media, they do not close up the large number of female collectors and wine lovers in the real world, advertising and web forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or at the office.
In fact, they do not bring their Thursday mornings around the corner of Berwick Street's wide range of broadcasts, such as wide-eyed and karmic, 30-year-old TV receivers to test the bodies of the evil-unexpected middle-aged men in this corner.
Holker is the longest live bright animal - video report
Researchers say that Holkers have longer life and more than any other planetary galaxy.
In the case of Hauta, a study by Julius Nielsen says that the prophecy is in the naar, which is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and which is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application for the withdrawal of goods from the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities for ten decades of temporary shelters and restaurants in the jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
In its proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to trace all 72 temporary trades in which people sell goods from low-energy sources, offer haircuts or sell them at 50 cents (40 pens), or sell simple food in a few Euros.
Calais's Prefecture Office has argued that the places will be destroyed because they represent taxes free of charge and because they are fuel and clean.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that goods and restaurants are vital in saying that public facilities offered by the State support organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and public facilities to those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille stated that there are no legal grounds for the arrest of 72 persons on a temporary basis, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, coffee shops and restaurants played a much greater role than food for people living in extremely insecure circumstances.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places below the turquoise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café, whose activity is an unintended success, which offers 200 atriums daily, English and French feelings and shelter paths for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
Over 170,000 people have signed an invitation to protect their children’s coffee table.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure of coffee would be "an accident for these children who are only eight years of age".
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, assessed on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to 9000 people - to peak - after the number of arrivals rose steadily during the period.
Food price is clearly lower in Finland than in the EU average
Food has a negative effect on the enjoyment of consumers and on the food of producers in Finland.
Food prices have dropped by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years when the average price in EU countries dropped by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food has become the most expensive in Germany and Sweden.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland, mostly from EU countries which have a level similar to that in Finland.
From comparisons only in Britain, food prices have dropped faster than in Finland.
The information will appear in the Development of the Statistics Centre of Ilkaka of the Journal published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is since June of this year.
In early 2010, the price of food rose dramatically.
In 2013, prices fell close to 1994.
Your situation was urgent.
"We were close to losing the price that came from EU membership," the paper says.
Then you followed your turn, after which food became worse from year to year.
The prices now weigh on Russia's food import restrictions, which have caused food to freeze from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the prices of agricultural producers have fallen.
"Poutin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short time," the newspaper says.
The registered price competition between industry and trade has also affected price reductions.
Great sales tickets to S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
Consumer price competition has been seen as popular campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a source of good food, even though the price of food has dropped sharply.
In 2015, food was fourth in Finland from EU countries which had a similar level of remuneration as Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on price tax.
He found that if there was the same rate of tax, there would be a lower food in Finland than in the same third countries.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If there were seven net tax rates, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more food than Finnish.
"If we want to get to the level of the EU's old countries at food price, we need to pay the price tax to half the EU's average and continue the price negotiations," the newspaper writes.
The paper notes that the calculated value-added tax percentages made by him are indicative.
School isn't so much before.
A return to school may indicate that there has been a change in school during the summer.
The school has developed a new teaching plan, which is taken up at the beginning of the class in all of the classrooms.
It is a guide to all Finnish schools.
Schools decide on their own details, but the plan sets out official objectives.
New guidelines have been developed over several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the education of beauty literature is created, and instead they are taught by codification at school.
Sweden’s education is already beginning in the sixth grade, and society is already being read by four.
However, the major change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone must be active and learn from others.
In this way we try to make school work more interesting.
The world's long-lasting silver mine has been found. The remains can live for 400 years.
The most known Greenland haemorrhage (Somnosus microcephalus) reaches 150 years of age of gender.
It can live 250 years later, reports a new study.
The figures make the species of the longest of the world.
In the animal society, it ends only with an Icelandic doll, which the oldest known individual has lived as a 507-year-old.
Greenlands are a long way from North Atlantic.
Their management also has another prediction: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The snakes hunt dogs for longer. They can grow even more than five feet [5 m].
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the findings, only about a centimetre a year, adults have been more aggressively living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen took a clear view of his colleagues.
He determined that there would be an age of 28 who had remained on the request of fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio broadcast of the eyes.
The mean age of the disease studied was at least 272 years.
Two large fish, 493 and 502 centimetre amaconies, were discovered at about 335 and 392 years of age.
As previous studies have shown that breast cancers reach more than four quarters of the population, researchers estimate that they are at this stage of about 150 years.
The research would publish Science.
From Stockmann to nearly 300 - salesmen are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are expelled from Stockmann.
In the event of difficulties, the cooperatives concluded in the company at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are carried out as exits," says Stockmann in his report.
According to it, the number of sellers of commodities is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as seller.
Stockman's net negotiations relate to about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of their work, some 380 workers were assessed for their reduced needs.
A small reduction is intended to cover about EUR 20 million per year, which is to be implemented in the first year.
Stockmann has already launched an effective programme aimed at achieving the savings of EUR 50 million this year.
As a result, it is difficult for Stockman to obtain support for the trade in goods.
Although the Group's adjusted business income improved by the second quarter of the year by EUR 11.1 million, trade in goods continues to cost.
According to the company's sales manager, Mr Vejalais, according to the company's director, the sales in the retail sector has not been achieved for the purposes of the company.
"Reductions of personnel are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive business income of Stockmann Retal in 2018," Vejalanen says in his report.
The second annual income saving rate was particularly impressive for Lindex's success.
Kätje achieved the best of all times of the second year of his business and his income.
Lindex's profit grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the last year, the total turnover of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimated that this year's business change in the group will take place in the last year.
The adjusted business income is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is set in the north - a temperature of less than 20 degrees throughout the country
The centre of the low pressure on the northern part of Finland is considered to be a hundred yards away, reports HS meteorology Ilona Läng.
There are also seeds in the middle of the country, but there is still a drought in the south.
The temperature is no longer very moderate, as life expectancy is below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern ports, there are between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's General Security Team handles the doping channel - explanation for the manufacturer's failure
Kenyan generalist John Anzrah was sent from the Olympics to the home of the Rion after it became apparent that Anzrah was present in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah tried to show was 800 metres old-fashioned Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan Arap Group, said that Anzrah’s personality was revealed after he had given the spectacular performance of Rotichia.
The Doping Operators went to announce to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Anzrah, he was sent home because he "has committed a crime against the Kenyan peasants."
He showed up as a musician, gave the show and even signed documents.
We cannot accept any of these uses," the chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, for his work at the Reuters news agency.
Olympian generalization starts on Friday, and Rotich is about to run right away.
There is still no idea whether the driver has any consequences for the case.
Rotich spent the last year on the MMs on his fourth trip and was the first winner of Rio.
According to Reuters, the source of the Kenya General Security Team was said because Anzrah was on the credit card of the athlete only to get open atriums.
When the antidotes met him, they were his dancer and he was taken to the test.
The manufacturer did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid that he would reveal himself," she said.
Where's everybody?
Rion's general irradiation has been wiped out
Where's everybody right?
They're not the only ones on Rion's Olympic Stadium in the next.
In Russia, competition was launched on Friday from the mass media, but the world’s top players were able to present their art to an amazingly empty view.
Rion's organizers reported on Friday that only 58% of breakfasts were sold and 65% of evenings were sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was packed with people who were starving.
The finals are already sold in Riossa.
The view of the Rion Olympics has already been taken into account before general warming.
For example, thousands of empty pockets have been seen in the sights of Ruggby, Melon and Travel.
When Brazilian methologists Talita Antunes and Larissa played the flag in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was full.
After the Brazilian casino, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 lives were full.
A bad mistake is to explain at least that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
In fact, even the first take-off of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to complete the football stadiums.
The newsmagazine journalist Mario Andrada said at the end of the week that 82 percent of the lead was sold at that time, which is clearly smaller than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million Olympics in London, 8.2 million were sold, although nearly half of them were spent in Rios.
In Russia, prices for lipsticks have changed from about EUR nine to more than a thousand open euro.
More than half of the slippers pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this has not been allowed in Russia since organizers need money and try to get tickets sold up to the last minute.
In Russia, organizers have indeed given 240,000 ligaments to less-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rion stadiums, there were empty spaces in the morning.
Even the orange ball Copacaban has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Centre competed in London 2012.

A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the new way of natural protection.
In recent years, the Foundation has acquired ecologically significant natural areas for its ownership.
Thereafter, private companies and communities can use money to raise their rights in the rural area.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from the Child.
The area has been divided virtually into accounts that wish to acquire the right of the holder.
The holder shall be entitled to a total of 187 fourths of its veto right of veto, which in practice means that each holder does not need to be approved if the purpose of the use of the land is to be changed.
The holder's rights can also be acquired for more than one year.
Acquisition of government rights is something concrete that can leave your family or give you a gift.
There is no need to go carry banners or look at yourself in order to protect the nature of the right to rule," according to Dr. Leviäkkas, who acquired the right to control the company.
The acquisition of the right of administration shall be subject to precise location information, which will allow for example the entry into force of a visit.
The names of the holders of the rights acquired on the website of the Foundation are listed on the same map as the country's census data.
The Leviathan considers its natural protection project to be only a risk of changing its activities from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a general institution aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the institution did something unfair or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The basic concept of the Helsinki Foundation’s management project is to protect natural areas so that they can be independent and peaceful.
The institution acquired land areas either by buying or by offering.
It is financed primarily by the sale of the rights of the holder, but the institution has been given its origin.
The purpose of the institution is to acquire additional protections.
It will also focus on the external borders of Finland and will plan a landing from Australia.

The pirates suffer from the worst of the cities Turku - see your family situation
The Bolpus are suffering from the worst of the cities in Finland.
This year, more than nine other major cities have been robbed of their residence.
Helsingin Sanomat explained on the basis of the information received to the police, which in most of the 10 major cities of this year has stolen dormitories and parts of them are estimated to be thousands of dwellings.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four points of reference to thousands of residents.
Instead, only about two roundabouts were reported to the police in Espoo and Koulola about a thousand inhabitants.
Good luck with that.
"In other cities, the number of people living in the same housing situation is similar to that of others," said police officer Tommi Reen.
The police of the market are wondering why the city is on the same spot.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have a answer for that.
"The generality of the barracks can affect how many cities are moved by bicycles and how many bicycles they have," said the superintendent Theemu Eikäs.
The police administration Tommi Reen is very expected to rise in comparison with Turkey, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of wheeled gears goes far beyond what are learning and cycles.
In the market there is a strong centre, short distances and a lot of bicycles to offer to fishermen.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different city where city centres are on the other side, and it is not an essential means of transport," Reen says.
Throughout Finland, the police know-how has become a little less expensive in January-July than in recent years.
The greatest joy, however, is not to be found.
In the last few years, despite the decline, the police have been reported to be less than 20,000 rounds a year.
It means 50-60 phillars every day and only about 4,000 rounds a year in Helsinki.
"They're great," Reen says.
In fact, the guards are bringing more bikes, because only part of the victims are reported to the police.
Reen calls on people to report criminal offences, even if the case reported to the police is less than ten.
Typically, the theft of a thief is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"The events also occur in other studies when, for example, stolen bicycles can be found in the housing in which smoking can be found," Reen says.
In Helsing, drivers are arrested every week for their own work or for the police investigation, says the older constable Timo Leppämek.
According to him, bicycles are stored, for example, from bicycles, interiors, warehouses and bicycles, in practice, from all places where they are usually kept.
In more recent years, Job has been robbed of his personal bicycles.
The U-block gives the bike a better protection than many other holes.
For example, some of the stockers use short-term bicycles for their own use, but most of the stolen bicycles end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're staying on their home market.
"The police have never come to know that stolen bikes would just go abroad," Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bicycles are considered to be ordinary Finnish according to the police.
I'm sure you can buy part of a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The owner of the wheel used must be careful because he may be guilty of an offence or an offence.
"The alarm boxes should be sounded if the approvals are clearly sold," Reen says.
Specialist Severi Hirvi wears no colour on Nopsan's working days at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
He's got five keys, but no one's been stolen, Hirvi says. "There's never been taken, there's been a good bank."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to you, there's no need to be a hipster value here," the Helsinian Hirvi points out.
A short time ago, Siri Valve closed his wallet with a small u-class in Helsinki.
Now the wheel was pushed up against the wall, but Valve usually closes his bike to something like a bicycle.
"There will be a lot of time to think about it, because this is my dearest thing," says the Helsinskileman of the white circle, which alone paid about five euros.
"All the time it's heard from the guys that the bikes have been taken."
"Most of the bad bikes, such as these-Jopoys."
Self-insurance was stolen several years ago from the inside of the company.
The four of us were really left unattended, so the Watch was waiting for its anaesthesia to take place.
Are you under 15 years of age responsible for crimes?
Helsinki's experimenting with U.S. comparator companies
In Helsinki, a so-called anti-comparator company is attempting to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
At the start of the experiment, it is applied to under 15 years of age, which are now free of criminal responsibility.
I don't think it's the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the anti-dumping company is discussing the incident with the perpetrators of the crime and imposing sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrators of the crime may also join themselves to improve their performance.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Young Acting Director Tommi Latio says that the model is not hard.
We've got some other conveniences that are used in the market.
"All are directed towards a young person's actions more responsible, so that everything will not go wrong for the first time," Latio says.
A model of the U.S. model has been taken from the comparison industry, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young man, not after his first crime, had to face the adult panel but reflected on what happened with the same planners.
Mallia's been tested once.
The experience followed the experience of the Palmum Service Manufacturer Iika Lovio says that there was a misunderstanding that was found successful.
In particular, the first crimes of less than 15 years have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message that you keep choosing the road," Lovio says.
A similar company is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is followed by the city of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Livio emphasizes that new methods of action are offered to all in need, not only to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are told in a signed letter asking for the end of the presidential campaign to be financed by Donald Trump.
The letter was published by the United States newspaper Politico, which had come to see the nature of the letter.
According to I, an open letter has been addressed to the President of the National Committee of the Republican Reince Priebus.
Signatories want money to be directed to the convention elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his inconceivableness, his incompetence, his incompetence and his premise inconsistencies threaten to bring about a voter in these elections," says Politic.
Only directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent the Republicans from breaking the Trump-Koriston bridge.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since the opportunities for Trump to win the presidential election will be less than a day.
Politico writes that the letter is intended to be sent in the first week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the body members of the letter is apparently the representative of my Republic, Andrew Weinstein.
According to politics, Weinstein has said that a letter will come from "people who want to protect their majority in Congress" and there is no support in this matter.
The book lists a number of the works of Donald Trump, which are believed to be made up of millions of voters.
In addition, he says that he has shown dangerous authoritarianism.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officers who were employed in a number of jobs announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trumpia as president.
Clinton promises to make it easier for the United States children
In the United States, the President-in-Office of Democrats Hillary Clinton told his own economic policy on Thursday morning.
I am trying to be president so that the United States economy will go well in every way.
"Donald Trump was trying to be president so that the economy would go well with him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The center of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year programme for improving U.S. infrastructure - yours, your bridges and your airport.
This would be financed by the tax havens of the rich, by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American dunes who suffer from the effects of the move to poor countries.
Clinton called for greater investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We're his construction team. We have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
In Torstaina Clinton also agreed to facilitate the position of working families.
On the other hand, in Torstana he heard from Sanders that the rich should pay their share of taxes.
And if the company's leaving the United States as a warhead, it's gonna have to pay for it, Clinton said.
Now he is opposed to the Free Trade Agreement in the Pacific, which he had previously supported.
"As [the President] I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to estimates published in The Washington Post before Clinton spoke, Clinton was going to consider the economic programme published by the Republican Donald Trump on Monday, that it was "only saving millions of this kind of money".
Clinton has previously named "Turper's tax base" as a tax base.
As Torstain Clinton insisted he was the daughter of a little boy himself.
He reminded the audience of the minors who had left Trump’s bills free of charge, and of the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America bigger again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton insisted.
These are Rio's reviews: The cats have not moved Finnish to the top of the streets, but the mobile app is interested
It's normal for sports fans to watch TV on the beach.
The Rion Olympics have not been targeted at the same number of targets.
Once upon a time, cats have added 12 percent of the population to the Red Sea: the night sky followed Ylen’s Olympics from TV2: at the same time 615 000 spectators.
Because of the comparison: the month-on-month-on-the-spot EMs received nearly 800 000 viewers on TV2 at once, and the feet-and-and-mouths at the end of the walkway EMs were roughly twice as many as two million.
Most of the Olympics have attracted the second round of Sunday evenings and opened a five-day telecom campaign aimed at the Olympics once and for nearly half a million spectators.
The general director of the sport Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectators, and he recalls that the viewers share in the Rion Olympics for the first time several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnish are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of its TV viewers choose Olympics.
TV and Yle Fem channels are also shared by viewers.
The Rion Olympics are the first to be played by Yle who owns the entire canal.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are up to 500,000 throughout it, so it's a good basis.
Views are smaller than in 2012 in London or in 2008 Beijing, but the difference is explained in part by time - most of Rio's reviews will come to Finland at night.
Another reason why we are interested - if someone likes it now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the initials of someone's surprise, the interest would have been pumped up by it.
In addition, public pollution is just beginning, as is the case with other types of Finnish interest: pollution and pollution.
According to Poksise, the original figures have been expected to be close.
When the general alarm starts, the viewers will explode.
For all your discounts, Yle Rio 2016 mobile application, which rose on the first day of your checkout app App Storesa Finland became the freest application.
By Monday the application had been applied 150 000 times.
I'm afraid we're on the streets of 200,000.
"We'll get a week's watch later," Pokinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked with all users with hope.
Pokkinen says that the return has come and the cows have been repaired.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with slow and less technical problems at baseline.
Updated versions have been obtained from applications which should correct errors.
Rion Olympics are seen in the Ylen Canal and arena wider than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can monitor some types, and on the radio Yle Fue spends a lot of time every day.
The Olympics are probably the most working animals in the world, as are the last ones that can only follow from the Yle Canal.
From 2018 onwards, the Olympic Games are seen both in general and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deep lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland’s deep lake is Your Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres at Ristinsel.
It may be even more serious.
The technical trainer Matti Kannela found a 20 - foot - long [20 km] weight gain from Ristisel, which was shown at the bottom to be 104 meters.
In the mid-2014s, the Finnish Centre for Environment tried to strengthen the discovery by total consumption.
The procedure does not necessarily find a small depth of one hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
For the second time, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvas River (90 metres).
More than 80 meters away from Saima, Two Waters and Pejärvi.
They have not been examined as much as the Sun.
In particular, the base of Inarijärve has not been accurately carded.
"There may well be an unknown heart," Kannela says.
If the deep lake is determined by mean life, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
As a result, your Day will not reach the ten most serious groups, and the Suvas water is even longer.
Correction 12 August 14:29: The last chapter was corrected where the most serious lakes were wrong.
Any tax: Taxation of pensioners continues to be faster
The tax on pensioners is still higher than the wage earners.
The honourable Member said that there was a lack of interest on the part of representatives and the tax on pensioners was granted equal value for employers.
The presentation of the Government does not include such a statement.
We think it should certainly be.
The promised promises should be broken after the election, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners were reduced in earnings which slowed tax.
In his delegation, he was angry at the opposition of the representatives of the Ministry of State for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Stubbia (c.e.) of the elections.
The purchasing power is protected, it does not grow
In the presentation by the Minister of State of State Petter Orpon (C.E.), on the line of taxation, Ihala says that it is about the protection and not the increase of the purchasing power, as wages are not increased in the first year.
He says that tax aviation is beneficial for purchasing power and employment if other matters do not increase people's uncertainty.
The honourable Member is pleased with the wishes of Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) and the Orpon to the messages to respect the ability to reach a competitive agreement when it is difficult.
He says that keeping hold of the treaty is important in terms of faithfulness.
This is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it does not take it seriously by asking questions.
This will be necessary, because the economy is so much in the hands of domestic demand and people's own future.
Long-term unemployment allowance
Any person invites the government to suffer from long-term unemployment in the budget sector, at least to stop its growth.
In June there were some 17,000 long-term unemployed more than a year ago.
He says that if growth stops, the government's aim is to increase employment by 72%.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, the promise has a very high social cost.
By letter: In Thailand’s villages, of course, there are no Finnish victims
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings in Finland.
The delegation calls on the Finnish authorities in the country to monitor and avoid the fastest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for adult Finnish tourists in Thailand to leave because of the explosions on their way, but the orders of the Grand Mission are based on caution, Westphal says.
In Thailand very little Finnish
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their precise number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish Thailand trip is due to an annual change.
The majority of Thailand's passengers will come from South Europe and China this year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The main mission has been to provide information on the situation in the city to the Finnish people in Hua Hini, in particular.
However, many of our contact staff in Hua China are now out of town.
In general, by taking everything into account that it's going to be okay, Westphal says.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
According to Westphalen, there's still no information about the factors of the rats.
The main message is that events may be associated with the political instability of the divided society of Thailand and the recent referendum on the establishment of a military force.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The vote was not an open, democratic process.
In other countries, people were arrested, including those who reported that they were in charge of the law.
In the southern part of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict on the part of Muslims, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
However, more recent issues have not been covered by tourist attractions.
There's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
According to him, in the cities, the royal birthday and the date of the birth of the queen is celebrated.
The traffic in the city is very small.
The fact that the authorities are very precise about security affects the course of the day.
Thai Police: There is no question of international terrorism in the minds
According to the police, the seats are "local satellites" and separate from the usual terrorist reasons.
Islamic terrorism has also been banned, says the Thai police department according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the eclipse when 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as in the recommendations of tourists in Phuket and Hua Hinnis.
In the most popular tourist destination in Finland, Lomasiar Phuket launched four bombs last night, says the domestic newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to these findings, they did not require the death penalty.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, where one person was killed by the paper.
In the proposal for a tourist destination in Hua Hinnis, the local authorities have launched a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in a double pump.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Thanin in the east and Trang City, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both cases.
Surat Thani has also been known to many passengers because it leads to Ko Samin, Ko Pha Nangin and Ko Taon Lomazari.
The factors of the age are unknown
According to Preyut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military unit, the actors of the elite are not yet aware.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and madness.
We don't have to force people anymore, he told the suppliers.
According to Minister of Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are related to each other.
He told the Thai BSB that the authors' intention was to destroy the country's tourism because all the fairs have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finnish people in the country to be careful and to avoid the fastest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finnishs of Thailand to abandon their journey because of the explosions, but the instructions of the Great Depression are based on caution, Westphal says.
Europeans affected
During the night of Finland, the victims and their victims are known to be very few.
It has been proposed to get some more information from the evening Hua Hinnis.
There a local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The target group includes at least German, Italian, Dutch and Western.
At least three people were killed in Hua China's last siege.
Two bombs were fired by a known clock tower.
Thai PBS says the police have separated Hua Chinese territory from where it believes it has found another bomb.
The death of Thanin bomb was hidden under the government of the country.
In the village, a decent worker died.
There's at least one target.
CNN's police officer who challenged it says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's case, which exploded about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
In the United States, Billes won women's blackout
In the United States, Alexandra Raisman was the second point on 60,098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina on the third floor of 58,665 points.
Billes, 18, aims at the Rion's pockets of television in the permafrost, hippies and trees.
Billes has ruled the power of women in the last few years.
He has three front rows of eight individual world champions.
He's won the fourth and third championships three times later as well as the last and second years.
In the United States, Biles has achieved two world championships.
The best MM medals in Biles have a hip and a leg.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The idea has no effect on tourism"
There is no concern about the impact of the Thai bombs on tourism on the effects of Thai bombs on children’s toys and toys in the same building.
If there is no further evidence, I don't believe that this is going to be any more amazing, it's been estimated by a Finnish company in Asia for about a decade.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedys in Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then an avian influenza, and last year a bomb bomb in Bangkok.
If these had not previously been visited by tourists, of course, this would have been the case.
The care company's office is located within a few hundred metres of the explosion site.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The employer called for about nine local time and said he couldn't support coming to the office.
The guard says that both the border and the main Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the clouds.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the courts had been set up because of the royal birth date, Huovila says and refers to the festival in Thailand on Friday.
In Patong, the feeling was calm and calmed. The movement was allowed to open for about ten hours at a local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard of the sounds.
On the third day of Thailand’s time Patong’s traffic had been normalized and most of the goods had opened their doors.
On the basis of the site of the site, the explosion has been a small time, the site of Huovila said.
Later that car was seen in the Krununupita at Jouxholmintie.
When the police came to the scene, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men who were suitable for identification as a man who had been hidden for nearly six months.
The other man was arrested right away.
The other went to the police station, but later the man was found using a forest police force.
The men are suspicious of the use of the motorcycling machine, of the wearer and of the wearer and of the wearer.
The police are grateful for the instructions.
Director of Research on Russia's change in leadership: Explaining the difference
Russia carried out a major change in leadership over the years when President Vladimir Putin separated his government from Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and worked as a two-man of Ivan.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the conversion of leadership is one way of administration.
This is a way to prevent people from telling independent Presidential authority to themselves.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been hurt or injured by other leadership.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, which is part of a small internal border, is moving to specific environmental and transport conditions.
By presenting state media, Putin said that he was a joint decision.
Ivanov himself, according to the report, had been asked to move to other tasks and proposed Vainoa to the state, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that there is a clear consensus on Ivano's view on this matter.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia's important organisation.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people in Russia.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible as Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev rose as president.
Kangaspuro notes that the old card, such as government ministers, has recently been changed by Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the International Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's location is that Putin changes its neighbourhood to younger ones.
Isis fighters used civilians in human trafficking in Syria
They used civilians to cross the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't be interested in them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were transported to Jarabulus.
In the last week, Arabs and Kurds received about 90 percent of Isis from the important Manbini city.
However, according to estimates, ten leaders remained in the city.
Earlier in the news at 19:30: In the past we mistakenly told the civilians that they were fleeing from the city, and that Isis fighters were really fighting civilians around the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior Documentary Line is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's line of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Rights Tom Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilian tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the official's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior had previously refused to grant the Minister's list of participations to the evening Sanomi.
The Minister based his decision on the State Council’s guidelines and that the information had been written on the Minister’s calendar and not on the accounting material.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rios.
In the last few years, Bolt's been running out of time.
He broke off his back and had to leave the Jamaican Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am much better.
I've been very well trained and it's open, Bolt said in a press conference in Rios.
That paper policy included small-scale Sambanese and adverted suppliers.
Porina Bolt’s area is underway by the fact that the Japanese star has risen as a time when the general riot has been fought with doping scandals and a riot of interest.
Bolt’s previous death in Olympics came in Athens in 2004, when he was 200 metres away at the beginning of the period of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young man's license that slowed down and found your place of practice.
Four years later, in Beijing, he began his power at a hundred metres away, where he suffered from the end of World War II and the self-confidence of competitors at the time of his birth at 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, Bolt arrived at the MM in Berlin at the time of his wedding.
World events in Berlin are still in force at 9.58 per cent and 19.19 per second.
The Russian Bolt has announced its goal of 200 metres of global warming and 19 seconds of decline, but no one believes in its birth to be more than Bolt himself.
Porta Bolt's most challenging challenge is the 2004 Athens Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
In the last year of Beijing's MM final Bolt, only one hundred percent of Americans were born.
Bolt has not been destroyed at the beginning of Peking's power at any time in the finals if you've only been on your way.
In May 2011, one hundred MM-finals remained in Boltland because of a volcanic eruption.
Bolt's going to complete the race after 30 weeks.
He's an old man of the species of young men, and Rio's cats are his last Olympics.
For the last meal of Uranium Bolt has set up MM classes in London for the first year.
These are the Olympics that separate me from my memory.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down here, I remember myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrate challenge.
Discoveries From Russia: two athletes suspected of doping
According to China State News Agency Xinhua, China's Chinese Prime Minister Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive example of doping in the Rion Olympics.
The Chinese doping sample of Chen Xiny was found after banned substances.
As well as the Bulgarians, Silvia Danekova is suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general security guard was sent home because he gave a doping sample for a sportsman.
Silvia Danekova has been given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was placed in Rios for four quarters of women in a 100-metre-long line.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estado, the Chinese authorities have brought their case to the attention of the International Court of Justice of the Urheil.
Xinhua tells us that the display of Xinny on Sundays should have been marked on hydrochlorothiazide diuretes.
There have also been other doping days in Russia.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female surgeon Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya's gone home because of a doping.
The International Olympic Committee of the KOK told Torstana that the Kenyan manufacturer had been tested as an athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, there is Kenyan long-distance journalist John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using a 500-metre-long train pass by Ferguson Rotich.
Phelpsi doesn't stop anything - historical gold came into display style
As a successful Olympic player, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., took his 22nd Olympic goal at a distance of 200 feet [200 m].
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps reached the first spring of the same type of Olympic in the fourth generation.
The Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed in parallel before China's Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC's Olympic Commentary Helen Skelton's game in the long run of the night.
Helen Skelton (O.k.a.) is the most popular event this week on the Night's Eve website.
In the fourth comment, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if, at some point or in the British press, he has a small spot in his revealing and special place.
The TV is a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton has been dressed in high-quality shoes and short skirts, which certainly has at least enough transparency - at least a number of conservative British eyes.
However, the rear axles are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little monsters are just fun.
Skelton certainly wants to relax and use the fields, but he doesn't want to be in the head.
It's not about me. He's right.
There's a lot of sports here, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn't be as bad as I wear it.
Can you imagine that the court's been exaggerating until Finland?
I can't, but all that matters to me is how hard these vampires are doing tomorrow and how big they're making their sacrifices, it's okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It's empty if it's about to come up with ( June) clothes.
I've been interested in a little bit if this guy's been able to do some research.
Rion's police did two arrests because of a terrorist attack.
The Rion police reported to Torstana that it had arrested two people because of a terrorist attack.
The police took care of the case security.
At the same time, the police took five other arrests and heard two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news station, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police were already arrested in July.
Those who are held believe that they are in contact with the Isis.

Argentina's lady dressed in a dress dress - Finnish face protest
The wind at Pettaj-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rios.
The wind of Pettaj-Sierre experienced severe storms.
Argentinian lady wore Tuul Petäjä-Sirini as a tortoise in Russia at the opening of the day of the women's surf.
The wind was clearly broken.
The respondent agreed to the strike.
He left because of the cholera, and others complained, the Finnish Chief of Staff Joakim Willenius told me.
The dancer considered the protest for a long time.
It was then not supported because it would have been a waste under the Olympics.
I should've dropped into the water so I could get a favor, you told me.
The Finnish broke down on the table until the last day because he didn't want to get Rion into the open water.
Finnish left the coral behind instead of 27.
In London, the total number of Olympics in 2012 is eight.
The color of the needles didn't even affect it.
There's an important day on Friday when you leave 10-12.
Turned 0.39: No protests have been made since the first information except for the Pettaj-Siren.
7 special matters that science believes will prolong
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the universe.
These things have proved to be additional years in a person's life.
Some of these are practices that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so as to prolong his life.
Sometimes things that a person cannot personally affect can bring to him additional years of age.
Such are, inter alia, the degree to which the average cost is low or the social position.
Regular shopping can take a long time.
We don't always have to break down, but we're just looking for enough milk.
The secret of long-term age has been trying to find out a lot of different research.
Medical Daily presented seven random findings.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Feeding of fish and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect some of the foods, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to "low risk of death", particularly with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Further studies on alcohol suggest that exposure to one third of a day may prolong life.
For example, one found that winemakers live with their parents rather than people who don't care.
Regular oral use can prolong a person’s life even for more than six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this is an obstacle to attitudes.
They can also promote the rest of other diseases in a person’s home.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughter affected one’s life.
For seven years, over 44,000 people have been studying the project.
Those who were more smiling were 35 percent more likely to be lonely after the end of the experience.
Sex, when the protection of sex is taken into account, many studies say that it is good for health.
Besides, it can also last a long time.
Unfortunately, just having sex isn't enough.
In order for a person to get more years of life, he must also get orgasm.
It's not going to be a competition.
However, long-term ageing does not require undue sobriety.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large spines had low cholesterol levels.
Their elimination also included more of their own 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these causes with lower mortality.
Then there was an Olympic medalist or an actress who won Oscar, who was more likely to live longer than the usual doll.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an honorable person is likely to live in a way that brings his life into additional years.
Some researchers also doubt that the long-term age is due to a person's social status - which is also part of the goal of such recognitions as Nobel Prize.
A study of over 65-year-old purchases found that a person buying daily is likely to pay more than one parent per day.
This is due to a reduction in individual sales turnover.
It has also been found to be biochemical mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So put your credit card in your hands - this is not how it's going to work.
The impeccable bike racer was hit by a truck
In the case of Varsinais-Sweden, a heavy truck and passenger car took place in the spring.
The accident took place in Koske, Koskentina and Sorvaston on Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been in the past towards Forssa when the passenger car came against the same back, the part of the truck was on the right side.
The truck stopped after the explosion, but it started burning.
The driver succeeded in throwing the ball himself.
The car broke down and then I went over to the church.
In 1972, a woman who was born in a motor vehicle became a van.
The rescue plant dropped off the car of a broken driver, and he was transported to the central central bank of the market.
The result of a woman's oral examination was 2.02 promilla.
He's suspected of a broken cycle.
Mail sent out files to the wrong city
Salon K-City Market had a lack of out-of-court choice because the mail had been delivered part of the heavy damage to the Wall.
Teija Halti, who lives in the original village, was a tortoise to buy out tickets from Salon K-City market when it became a pleasant sight.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies because Posti delivered our cargo to the Wall!
We'll get more when the mail gets delivered!
Well, if you're going to wear it in a nuisance, it's in your pocket.
The retail chain is related to the fact that your post-extensions last morning are also being served to deal with food shortages.
The food chain is always in the mail supply until the end of August.
I thought it was almost interesting and he decided to share it in the social media.
The recommendation of the day hit me outside.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised in this matter is incredible, Haltia is amazed.
On Friday evening, Haltian's day, there were more than 700 pieces on Facebook.
The holding received its own favor by tapping into the doorcarts, even though a few layers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the Transport Services of the Postin Company, apologized for damage to the Night Sanomi.
After all, from the fifth floor, the three of us went wrong to the wrong place (Sainjjöki) yesterday, and we were no longer going to take part in three (Saloon), but we took only five stairs today, Kaidesoja told him to the Night Sanomi.
It was the first night of the story.
Uncle Haltia didn't get excited about the cold because she found out to choose all her own irtocarcs.

Hope for a woman murdered in Loviša: Remembering the victim for the good of the police
A week later, a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victims will be remembered for the good of the police.
The Sipoon Animal Medicines Agency has published a Facebook update, which focuses on the benefits that the victim’s family hopes will receive from the police.
The publication tells us that the victim had done work in place of the animal doctor’s office and also performed medical training there.
The veterinary surgeon reminds you of the words concerning women.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes the account number where gifts can be transferred.
The update indicates that the grant funds will go to the police officers as a whole, primarily to secure procurement.
In the past few years, 42-year-old hunters have had to be killed in their own home in Loviissa Koskenkokenkylä.
The neighbors of the woman have told the victim of the night that the victim was very animalistic.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, dogs and cats.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no women and had nothing to do with each other.
The killer's follow-up included police officer Börje, who was killed in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje remained alive and is on his way.
The Court of First Instance ruled that the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the infringement of the uniformity law.
The post did not have the right to retain the remuneration of a worker who refused to hire a tenant, according to the Court of Justice of Kanta-Häme.
The Court of First Instance ordered that Post be paid most of his salary and EUR 2 000 for the benefit of the workers.
According to the judgment, Post could have held only part of the employer's salary, which would have been opposed to the entire day's work.
According to the law of the Court of Justice, the employer had been established on the basis of a uniformity law on the basis of his professional union.
The staff members had followed the PAU's decision on the basis of a language of origin.
During the post office in November last year, PAU made a decision that does not mean that the postal workers are not the victims of illegal rentals.
He first told the People's News about it.
Turkey's path to respect for human rights

Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soin (ps) agree on the situation of human rights in Turkey.

Putin separated his administration from the head of the department - the state official of Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, Kremlin.
The status will be granted by the President of the Council of the Viron Communists, Karl Vain's son, Anton Vaino.
The disease is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as the Vice-President of the Government since 2012.
A member of the Russian Security Council will also be involved in this incident, which is told by the Interfax News Agency.
Vladimir Putin gave the bullet to the head of his government.
Ivanov, which is part of the narrow internal border, is transferred to specific environmental and transport conditions according to the Kremlin report.
Ivanov himself, according to the report, had asked to move to other tasks and proposed Vainoa's status, Russia Today tells me.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB headquarters.
Many viewed Ivanavia as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but as President Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: Manu's waste project for fear - not seen in the opening of the Valioliiga
The world’s leading role in football movements is not seen in the field when the English elections were launched on weekends.
Paul Pogban's scarf followed in England.
The Manchester Unit's release project, Paul Pogba, is due to fear when ManU opens its way against Bournemouthia every Sunday, told BBC.
Manu paid to the British press 105 million euros from Pogba in Italian for Youth.
However, the English football league FA keeps him out of the game because Pogbal has become a hero since Christmas.
He received two warnings in the last time in the Italian Cup, and that's what's gonna happen to one take-off.
That game was transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
The next port of Pogban is on the other side on 19 August, when ManU is located in Southampton.
It's a good thing that you're in Flow.
The precise criteria for delay and dignified views have been confirmed as an international event of the status of the Flow Festival, which is celebrated by the world's top performers.
The Flow Festival starts on Fridays in Helsinki.
The parties are typically dressed in their own dress.
One of the main artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is also set up by technicians and art institutes.
We've never had enough to be just a ship and a diver, says the event's artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
In Helsinki Suvilahde this weekend, the Flow Festival has grown to be a small cardlife for tens of thousands of tourists.
As a result of the loss, there is a simple question: What would the authors themselves want to do?
In case of accident, it's time to think this way.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and to be provided in accordance with the rules of the authorities, says the event's artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before it happened that Flow was going to sell this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year by 5,000 spirits.
Festivals also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The growth of tourism is a good thing because making has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point there would be as much as a carnage led by a powerful storm.
That's not what we want.
The success of ideologies has been compared for 13 years with the presence of 130 artists, artists, and numerous restaurants and drinks bars.
In addition to the main and smaller exhibition halls, this year 15 000 people's rooms are in operation.
It is dear to me to admit that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little bit too big, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's spirit.
If it disappears, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work being done is that today the greatest sights are actually possible.
In the early 2000s, half-life activity was very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki for around EUR 20 000.
In the last year, the turnover of the company operating in Flow was about EUR six million.
This allows for "more serious cases", such as the implementation of a 73-metre wide roof.
Flow's visitors are typically aired by their own self-contained dress.
On the wall of the music scene, you can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been clearly profiled as a particular form.
We want to get separated first by everything.
Nevertheless, the shape-scientists also agree with Flow's world of values: hatred and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the leading artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a large fan group in his own generation, but he has an indierocky, pop music, rap and solo at a festival that combines it with all the typical performances.
Iggy's been shot because it's probably the last time it's seen everywhere in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last cover is the best of his own, and he's done the best of his last year.
The bomb of the Thai tourist paradise had been hidden in the catechisms - tourists were fleeing in terror.
In China, Hua fired a local time in the morning tortoise two bombs.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bomb was apparently seized by a band of insects and fired by the sensors.
Bombs were placed on a street where most customers are foreign.
They were fired at the same time that the tourists began to leave their bars and return to their hotels, according to police representative Samuer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek in Asia has tweeted an image of a wide variety of plants.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can see it from this.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists in Hua, China.
He said that the bomb had exploded at the edge of the bar.
It happened one of the biggest baracies, told Swedish tourists Emilie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of victims is not known yet.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
Of course nobody died.
At the same time, another double pump was made in Hua Chinese.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me they found Hua Hini, of course, at least one bomb that had not yet been triggered.
According to the Thai authorities, behind the bombs are probably the main groups that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been seriously involved in the activities of human trafficking criminal organizations.
KSML: This part of the new preparatory groups is due to war in the first place
In an acute war situation, the armed men are ordered to fight only several months after a military coup is taken, says the Central Finnish.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the primary education officer of the defence forces, for example, in the situation of armed men, is only those who are at the end of their training.
According to the Training Officer, the service shall first be designated as a reserve belonging to the preparatory groups.
No guardian or reserve officer shall be charged with a task which has not been granted training, Sonnine says.
In the past, it has been shown that defence forces are engaged in training emergency equipment units from the beginning of the first year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during emergency training.
Pamela Tola received leave payments from the hotel
The sampler Pamela Tola and her former husband, the supplier leader Pauli Waroma, have won a rare apartment that they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two cross-sectional apartheid was EUR 330,000.
However, after trade, a serious complication arose in the home, which led to a dangerous growth of microbiotics.
In 2014, Paris had to sell the apartment as a garbage dump.
The sales price had risen to EUR 132 000, so the economic loss to Tola and Waroma had been reduced to EUR 198 000.
The Paris Group took the matter to court and asked for a sale of prices there.
The sellers violated the requirement, but Tola and Waroma won the case, both in the courts and in the courts.
The Court ruled on the matter as a matter of midweek.
It was in force to the Court of First Instance, which ordered the sale of EUR 150 000 for Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller has to compensate for the costs of law enforcement and disclosure of the parity of EUR 47 344.
The right to an airport was somewhat justified because some of the same housing needs had already been in the knowledge of the buyers in the course of the operation of the housing trade.
However, according to the case law, the apparent structural defects were substantially more serious than those indicated.
The hotel's looking for a welcome home
Tola told the court that the parishioner had been looking for an approved home because they did not want to make any adjustments.
He had been born with the idea that the building was based on good quality and that there is no harm to the buildings mentioned in the civil investigation report.
The public assessment report indicated that there was a risk and indirect climate change and that it was not sufficient to reduce the risk of long-distance drinking water management.
However, on the basis of the discussions there was no indication that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Wararo remained convinced that the future of precious seeds might have to be guided a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the housing costs were much more serious.
In 2012 and 2013, inspections carried out on the construction carried out by the Witnesses showed microbiotic growth, resulting from both high and capillary increases in soil levels.
On the west side, the air pollution of the house of the microbe may have been considered by the inspector by means of a baptism into the interiors as well.
A possible health risk, border values over-the-morning or snow were found in public buildings, basement portals, living room windows and basement bathrooms.
The terraces were built without permission
In the case of justice there was also a dispute as to whether the apartment was extended against the construction permit.
The Court found that Tola and Waroma had not been aware of the decision of the city of Espoo prior to the sale, which allowed the residence to change its mind.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there had been no suitable ceiling.
However, home problems were the main issue in law.
According to the Court of Justice, the purchasers were likely to sell before the sale on the basis of the information they received, assuming that the construction was applicable to such housing and that there was no need for a measure of adjustment in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a more extensive examination of the case law.
The buyers are not deprived of their responsibilities, the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction.
Hard record: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to their children - also in Finnish registers
In his youth, Christopher Andersson writes in his article Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives of the United States in Maryland has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but they are also United States, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, the Nazis wanted at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women.
Documents and registration cards are originally from the RU Office operating in Nazi Germany.
The Rotu Office works under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was able to acquire children before he had studied with his SS doctor.
The same was true of women who were supposed to have more than 10 children.
According to Anderson, women were subjected to gynaecological research to find out.
The Rotu-British Bureau identified the results of women, including by examining church literature.
The purpose was to ensure that women were not Jewish in sex.
Women also had to be willing to make a dedication to Sweden’s citizenship, to give the red tape to the Rotary Office, as well as to make good recommendations to the neighbors.
The Rotu Office wanted to point out that women were "children", "saviours", and "good civil society" who were very involved in Germany.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as nurses by SS.
The account does not tell us how 14 Finnish men found in the archives.
The SS leaders set up a government support programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme included the provision that each SS man should have four children, either at or outside marriage.
The Lebensborn families take care of their children and their mothers outside the marriage.
However, the programme has not been very actively promoted, the United States of America's credit institutions are being told.
Instead, the nation's population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary president of the German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages are confirmed.
As a traitor-Sierre's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed as a third pass from the first day of Finnjolli on the Rion Olympics, but the second day he left the whole team behind.
Nirkko grew up in a total of eight hundred after five years, but the failure of the second was replaced by 14.
The wind Pettaj-Siren fought RS:X at the beginning of the day 17 and three.
There's six of them at Pettaj-Siren's office.

The Lindgrins are in place.
Jari Sillanta's satellite had a couple of hours of fun at night: "I was so upset."
Jari Sinlanpä has been a member of the Finnish Volunteers for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship's bar in 1995 as a tanker, Finland's best seller as a solo artist, as well as for the dance boats and festivals, Silanpea's time is up to date, and he's on the rise right now.
By Mari Kopisen, a book about the life of the poet, Jari Sillanpä - Paljaana was published today in Torstana.
In the book of Silas, we read about his life and his death in both good and bad.
On the other hand, the young man rose to a true rise when he won his victory at the Red Wall in the Tango market in 1995.
At Kisa, Sillanpea sang songs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the summer of 1995, Jukka Kupuppamäki had gathered a man's request to the head of Sillan, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
On Saturday, the concert was one of the most popular events in the history of Finland.
However, the book says that the vote did not go exactly according to the plan: The king sang it in a strange crater and only a few hours later.
We had a party tonight.
I was in such a hurry!
The head of the coin is remembered in the book.
As a mighty man, you would not immediately think it was played by a harpoon.
Although I wasn't physically the best, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, I don't have to ask myself to be perfect and superior.
The accident of another man’s best friend, mentioned in the book, took place about a decade later.
In 2013 Sillanope separated from such a partnership and the case ended also You deserve the gold-back text published alone in 2014.
The book tells us that the singing of Sarah’s Song of Solomon was not as desirable as that of the Song of Solomon.
The poet had imagined that he was making a book that tells the truth about his own life, but the words he told from the distance were not true, but it had been written on the basis of a news report of the 7 - day magazine.
In the newspaper, Jarin and the ex-racana were told about the excessive use of Jarin and alcohol, but according to Jarin, it was full of poppy and did not keep its place.
According to the book, Jari called on the radio and refused to sing from the chapter, but finally he decided to sing it - and so on.
In June the British were surprised by the vote of their nation outside the EU.
At the end of 52% of the voters were different and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although the polling week's opinions predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and the economic institutions were almost single-mindedly based on their survival in the EU.
No respected research institute or university has moved on account of the difference, even though a few individual researchers felt different from the authority of their profession.
The theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the US election campaign by former President Bill Clinton of the United States, took place in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were upset when they didn't hear their voice.
They were disappointed when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economical kiara language
The Centre for Macroeconomics will receive responses to Brexit disaster.
The typical answer is that economics were not heard because this time the voters made a decision on other than economic grounds.
One economic explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employees, almost certainly so.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right out of Britain.
Many also have the view that the calculation of the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes export industry.
In the opinion of the economic community, the voters did not believe in economic arguments because economic unity was not sufficiently evident.
In particular, they were exploited by the level playing field of BBC, which gave only a few percent of the EU's economic sector support for economic scientists as well as the overpowered majority.
The EU's hate paper was not interested in how different the impact of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capital systems are.
These far-reaching written systems have been talking about economic growth, trade relations, state debt and currency.
And if economic messages were heard and understood, they were ignored because economicists represent an elite with whom voters do not think they are of common benefit.
Academies such as economics would have remained in the EU but did not act in small towns and rural areas.
Agriculture is also an economy
The overarching argument of Brexit's vote on migration has been a win-win argument.
The immigrant takes your place at work, the immigrant burns your patient, the immigrant uses you to accept you.
These arguments went wrong.
Every coffee has foreign workers.
How many more jobs in Britain would have been if they had gone away?
In the waiting room of each health centre there are immigrants.
How much easier it would be for the British to take medical time if they weren't?
Every school has the children of immigrants.
How much easier it would be for British children to get a place of school if they got separated from them?
In each country, foreigners live in it.
How much more would the originals be if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economics have not been able to respond to them, and if they have succeeded, their response has not been visible.
Economicists have not been able to explain that the British have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net taxpayers of the British public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's state-of-the-art government saved Brexit's hand
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which corresponds to the Finnish authorities Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, plans A and B were made for Brexit in times.
Plan B, the EU-supporting line, was launched for more than a few weeks before the vote in order to ensure that the outcome would be complete.
It was worried that investors would start taking their money out of the market.
The state-owned banks do not normally have a reasonable amount of cash, but they may now be necessary.
We're going to raise our hands.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25 per cent of the investments of the fund in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says that Aberdeen's only openings are marked daily from the state-of-the-art fund that the news is dealing with.
According to the old man, normal levels would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the value of the money was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest number in the nine open buildings, Vanhanen says of all the open buildings in the UK.
He estimated that the lower hand rate in these funds remained ten percent or even below.
The real estate governments thus managed to save Brexit in a very different strategy.
The funds closed the trade
When the EU won the battle against the scourge, Europe went into chaos.
However, two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were very peaceful, Mr. Vanhanen said.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the President of the central bank of England, Mark Carney, who felt that Brexit could be at great risk to business firms.
In addition, the first of the fixed-rate institutions, Standard Life, has been frozen in its commercial process.
Together, they broke down the situation and took the matter to the head offices of the Financial Time and BBC.
The situation was compared immediately in 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This got investors into trouble.
The institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Lumippalo began to cycle, and the fund was to close its door after the other one.
Aberdeen’s situation was good for collected funds, but it had to be frozen for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close trade, but they changed prices below.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether they now support money to lead into panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't work because it would cost you money.
It calmed the situation, and most of the people started reporting.
After that, it was quite equal, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, Vanhanen's story.
He notes that, for example, Aberdeen Manner-European funds have had nothing to do with death.
However, a lot of questions came up.
Immediate attention to the housing industry
In the old opinion, the closures of the sale of fixed-exchanges received little undue attention.
The open funds covered by the closures govern about four per cent of the British units.
Aberdeen’s lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80th estate in London.
Some other funds are still locked up.
Auviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could hold its funds by the end of 2017.
At this point, there is uncertainty, and economic growth has been reduced below, but the situation does not appear to be "increasing".
The biggest issues now relate to the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the local authorities even new opportunities, with the attention of Old.
The red and dollar rate is the lowest for 30 years, which is also 15 per cent lower than before Brexit's vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property by up to 30 percent less.
There's a lot of wanted buyers, Oldman says.
Brexit brought discounts to London's real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't seem very amusing.
But four times when Pertti Vanhane, who was responsible for the construction of the headquarters of the British State Department of State, was raised to review the results of Brexit's vote, the situation was different.
By the time you got there, you got it.
I realized that this is going to be on the B side of the plan, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was going to work right away.
London City was already completely alive in the morning.
The normal TV channels that were normally unvoked were aware of the news, and usually the crowd was very late to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron arrived early in the morning to tell the camera about the rent.
When the markets opened up, the showcases seemed to be just red.
It was a morning that would never have believed in his life, Oldman said.
This is not why, despite myllery, Aberdee, one of the UK's largest state institutions, last day after Brexit's vote, the two state trade.
The tunnel was so cool.
However, the company had been well-equipped for an alternative, and that is why the situation was in a peaceful manner, according to Vanhan.
Brexit's vote started with the correction movement
The vote was followed by the mayor.
Ponta Romana, the British leader went to exchange.
The market began to predict limits to the UK and in particular to the London real estate market.
In London, even 20% of the reductions were expected in the coming years.
A small group of British state governments began to freeze their trade after each other.
Aberdeen made it for six days.
Now the plant's broken down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
It really doesn't see the last summer of this week in the old days in Helsinki.
He still thinks it's too long to say much about what happens to Brexit.
So much is still open: how different it is and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information has already been obtained on the development of the London real estate market.
CBRE’s CBRE’s information on price developments covers about three thirds of the market.
According to them, prices for all units in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the interest rate was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen's list.
The bones aren't so terrible, but they're moon changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the same major outbreaks occurred in 2007 and 2008.
It is therefore interesting that Brexit was compared to the fall of Lehman and the beginning global economic crisis in the United States of America.
In the old opinion, the comparison is not exactly appropriate, because now there is a British domestic crisis.
There's another tunnel.
The real estate market has now not seen the likes of that period but the desire to sell more liquidity, says Vanhanen.
It's normal to find funding.
Corrections could have been in any case
Actually, the price adjustment team isn't a miracle for him. This could have been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, prices for units in London and other cities in the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overrated, says Vanhanen.
That's when the bottle started really high.
The prices in London have fallen for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strong, and so has the people of London.
Another major trend is that the properties are the last category of property that is globalised, says Vanhanen.
In the Middle East and Asia, new operators have come into the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for housing jobs abroad.
London is known as the city's easy spot.
In addition, prices have risen to a low level, so for example, pension companies have had to seek new products.
The loan has been easily available - even if it has been used according to Old Age, it is now clearly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Get out! Get out! Get out!
The rise in prices in London last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to simplify its properties in London, and there were net sales last year.
There was some kind of translation waiting for you, and now it's coming.
What's in front of this?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhan says.
He doesn't believe in the future, but he says there's no way of getting up.
The sensor indicates that there is a downward or even going forward.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the dead will be found out by work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in globalization.
If you've invested in the single market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's spread, the risks are spread too, says Oldman.
The S group will start registering the purchase information more carefully before
The S-group knows what you eat, because my trading group told me today that it was starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
By the time the information has been collected from the end of May, the group will begin to waste it from the products purchased as well.
The S group will come after Kesko because the information on the goods purchased on plus cards has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy, the return from the programme, according to Hismo Ritala, has been mainly of the benefits.
The product details shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used as a guarantee for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
When a rare customer has denied the use of product information, Ritala tells Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the S-group registration.
The Centre is already classing its client into ten groups according to just the food units.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
The number of purchases and the amount of money used are also classified by the customer.
The information shall be used for the marketing of the client.
The product-specific purchase information shall only be collected from the K Group's own boxes.
Co-operation partners, for example, Neste Oil are not created.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone programme and does not have such a set of plans.
Finland has its Yökösbonus side client programme, which can be connected to the Elections, the Sivows and the Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or product levels, we remain as high as the final level.
But we know where the purchases were made and I'm on the day and the customer's end.
We haven't gone to the level like the K-group or the S-group, says business leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the stand-alone programme is intended to continue to reform, but the Middle East will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of the product information to be started.
The test shall be performed at the start of the test.
Sok’s customer and customer register has been relatively wide up to this point.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also been included in vocational training, housing and children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
S-Etukukortiosto has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, location, termination of purchases and payment.
In addition, data from S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cassette systems.
From the beginning of October, the purchase information for the product is stored in Sokos and Emotion boxes.
Instead, the data in S-markets, Prismos, Kokon Terro and ABC are recorded at the second level of production.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that the market could be better placed, says the head of the SOK client and partnering company Marjaana Saarikoski.
The S-group says it's about changing its information to customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data on the market.
However, the data are recorded in case of any case, whether or not it was intended.
The request may be verified on the S Group’s website.
For example, cash is not available for information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila Pentu is the newest dog breeder - the pen becomes the first explosion
The Black Labradorinator's pendulum is gently five of the same country's fleet set at Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It won't be long when it's definitely sitting next to the middle class.
The customs examiner Lass Suntio rewards his Heila dog by playing it with its pleasure.
From the building that was next to Heila, there was a hole in a hole in the middle of the road.
Rutikagasu is the first thing that has been done with Heilan now, says Suntio, owner of Heila Dog.
Security situation and network traffic
They are the first to find a specific dog for weapons and explosives in the Customs area and it is set up to work at the Helsinki-Vanta airport in the first year.
The tasks may also be carried out by Heilan and Sunton to other border areas and ports.
However, the airport must be the main place of work for Heila, as the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Court of Justice of Paris and Brussels has confirmed the measures taken in the Customs territory and after the hearings, said Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second access to training for arms and explosives in Customs is through the mail from Helsinki-Vanta.
As a result of growing internet trade, even 40 million mail shipments are carried out annually through the airport, which may include foreign-owned equipment and explosives.
Customs has been carried out in the last few years by the Helsinki-Vanta airport of a group of net sales of goods and passenger goods and aircraft for some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their source materials.
Heila is going to work on various parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will have to examine written travel goods and mail.
In the future, it will benefit greatly when it can be used through large county areas and select regions that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of their performance, Customs assessed whether to train more weapons and explosives in the future.
Grönberg has a positive attitude toward the idea.
School in the Church
The training of the Heila-Penn is the coordination of the Customs School for Dogs located in Kirkkonum.
The Union is also involved in training with Heilan in the creation of police and defence forces experts.
Police have a strong experience in training dogs and awareness of explosives by defence forces.
The customs shall decide together with other authorities what difficulties Heila is being taught to bear witness.
They're always going to continue school as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki-Vantalla are the six drugstores and the money and drugstore Mass.
Labradorinator Heila has been selected from ten dogs' penthouse.
The choice of the dog to be selected for the flight shall include the flagship and forestry as well as the peace of the dog as it is made with weapons, explosives and human beings.
Heila, who lives in the house of Sunon, is a close employee of the customs officer, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila coming home, Suntio's laughing.
The great orders go to Heila from the back of the storybook.
The cameraman of the night-sanomis quickly loses some protection for the dog, but Heila is returning from the softness of the play from the "out" window.
Competition in the labour market
Heila's primary school will be completed in the first year.
There are still tax assessments, followed in October, which assess whether training is sufficient for required work.
Heilan can see the work in Helsinki-Vantaall for the first half of a year if everything goes according to the plans.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to wear a dog on the staff, remembering Suntio.
The cost of one job is about EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their work is about seven to eight years, even ten years later, after which they will be able to care for their owner.
The working days may be longer than eight to ten hours, but active hours last only ten minutes for a couple of hours.
The owner of the workers is a tough competition in Customs.
Heila's owner is looking for about 20-30 Customs employees.
I'm happy to meet Sunton, who has never had a job before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance activities in Customs.
The minority gets its first Olympics - its people get a day off
Under millions of Fijian Olympics in the Ruggy are valued in the country so high that the government has been designated as a national holiday on 22 August.
According to the country's radio society, the Fijian government has confirmed the decision on mastership.
The day of holiday is held at the group's home on the next day.
The Sancary Party also has a permit to celebrate Christmas at home.
Fiji's gangs are celebrating the master's party.
The Guardian reports that there was a fine follow-up in the capital of Suvalla, where the stadiums were equipped with a screen.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game together with our monocultural community.
Even in the Chinese industry, I heard they were encouraging, says Fiji Times provider Maikele Seru Guardian.
Dramaaa Riosa - The Finnish founder turned after the storm
In the last year, the weighted-up Milko Tokola succeeded in his business after a heavy fight of 175 pounds.
Tokola has special and life-threatening properties.
During or after the rise of the arms, he has been turned several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got a job in Russia as a result of 175 kilos and 145 pounds [145 kilos].
He had a total of 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last 155 pounds [175 kg], as well as elsewhere.
In the third business, stress rose as a result of a sudden turn of events.
Cropa was released under pressure until the court accepted a stand.
The Finnishman's pleasure is that he's been suffering from lung cancer.
RoPS acquisition virolaiser Prosan - with velvet - Night-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Paloseura, who plays in the football field of men, has made a long-term formalist with Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a team member who has an active role and who's driven to come to Finland and Rovanjem is small.
We went through 50 players across the world with more than ten players.
The small group began to be set up as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS's manufacturer, Dr. Juha Malinen, told us.
Prosa, 25, gets RoPS from Flora, where he made 109 seizures on 51 May.
He's also played in the Viron.
Prosa is intended to be with RoPS already on Saturday at the Seinjajjjj, where Russians meet the ruling Finnish Master of the SJK.
RoPS was required for a new attacker when Aleksandr Kokko recently moved to Australia.
The threat of Modern Family re-position: the shorts of the act reveal almost everything
A modern family come to be known as Alex Dunphyn's friend Ariel Winter again by reproducing his reputation.
Winter was portrayed in Hollywood this week in ministers' voices that don't leave much of their imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the feet of the exhibitor but also the back of this side.
18-year-old Winter has recently raised its attention by changing its style and use considerably more.
The star has emerged in a social media publication in pictures of very small clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very thin places.
Winter, at the age of ten, has recently published several pictures of herself at the festival.
If you don't see a picture, you can see it from here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
The founder of PowerwomenTV and supplier Amy Palmer doubted that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" for children.
He's been on television for almost his entire life and grew up in the times of the Kardashians.
He has learned that what more appears to appear on the surface, more public awareness and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has seen countless stories before.
Winter started in the modern family line when he was only 11 years old.
The exhibitor has highlighted some of its long-term fans in image transformation.
It's not hard to think where he's ten years old when the bottom is so hard now, to realize a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans instead defend the actor and call for immediate criticism.
You look great!
That's exactly what others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, to blow a young woman.
Japanese would like to see Northern Finland - tourists swimming on the return route: Syksysin is able to see the port of the Mirro aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start the Revolving Centres from the beginning, Visit Finland tells you in a message.
The main objectives of the Japanese Revolving Visit are Inari and Levi.
Revolves are our winter trip cards, and they are strongly combined into the countries of the heart and lungs.
There's a lot to ask for on the cheap return trips, but now we're trying to increase the sale of cheap travel.
It's rare to know that the revolving zone is starting from early autumn and is going on for long periods of time.
The reason is that it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the phenomenon of two times as many as possible, says Visit Finland's market manager Anne Lind in a report.
Visits to the main team of the Finnish Revolving Company are 25-35 years old, Japanese people living in the cities, benefiting from travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including the online country.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptional strong and positive picture of Japan compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese would, however, need clearer perspectives than Finland, and this return has a great potential for Lindin.
The nights of Japanese tourists have increased in Finland in other Nordic countries more clearly.
Last year they slept in Finland more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish travel as they used over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is pleased with the master's tour of its rugbyope Fidi
Iso-British's impact on the movement of ruptures led Fiji to present its last challenge at the end of the Thursday night when it was a group of 43-7 murders at Deodor's stadium here in Rios.
Fidzi organized a master course in the treatment of rats, rats, mice, rats, rabbits, runnings and blind forces to win gold - their first Olympics.
With the death, a reasonable relief came from the third day in Britain, and they were able to be very proud of their hard work in the start market of the Olympics, which they won in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
On the same day, the heavy 7-5 victory of the semi-final played from South Africa may have been difficult for them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have succeeded in this well even in a group of 15 people.
Britain may - but of course not - encourage that at least one British has at least one gold medal tomorrow: Fidi's main champion is Ben Ryan, England's former bomb from Wimbledon.
Ison-British's trip has been pretty good.
Eight years ago they destroyed Ryan's preparation for each game in Adela's tournament.
There's only one thing they lost.
This is a misunderstanding, but development is urgent.
Fidi started a great fight on behalf of the British Ison.
Captain Tom Mitchell's team material was like they were running on moving line cars, and the world's leaders were leading 5-0 after Osea Colinisau fell into the deep ground.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right floor led to the quake.
12-0, and Iso-British had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's great suit stopped the man-mountain Leon Nakarawa from making third ground, but it was only for Fid.
Seven minutes later, Jasa Veremalu made the floor on the right side of the floor, and the United Kingdom was destroyed by 17-0.
Nakarawa made a new beginning on the ground again, and in the hour there was still more than a minute... of the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravovovu ate from the treasures found in the British Ison and ran around to make a map.
After the earthquake, your condition at the stage was 29-0.
It seemed exactly how Fidi was born to play the rugby when he was once again taught the game from the British.
And that's exactly what it is.
In the past, the United Kingdom made many changes that supported Fid's path... for a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half of the time until Joshua Tuisova made the land after Fidi's influence on food.
Dan Norton stuck to the Iso-British ground in the left corner and in the coffee stand 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South American islanders who sang, lived on the cliffs and dances.
It was hard to be surprised at Fidi's strong approach.
Mata Vilame's last time on the ground was a disturbance in the Fid tree that didn't need any disturbance.
The picture was rejected by the Fijians, and the British fell into the light, completely crushed.
Earlier that day, Fidi had won Japan's 20-5 semifinals, and the United Kingdom won South Africa's hard semifinals, where they both made one ground - the British football game would solve.
Kyle Brown took the lead in South Africa on the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the ground with his sudden leg and made the ground floor below the other half.
A powerful later strike by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the 15th-Aside Group of England, certainly won and finally won a hope.
The war against food by the preparations was fought by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's team.
In these cases there must be no more impressive gold, and it really means something.
From the first journey to the last, 220 rants to the historical books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning from their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoalla.
Although they agreed on two, there were three voices in the sea. All of these were present during the second half of the Olympics - the first women in the history of the British Games, who were excited about the achievement of the song.
Their rule was perfect, and this was their 39th failure, which is predictable.
What we see as two wonderful players joining on the surface with a series of stars does not fully describe the nature of the victory.
At the back of each race, there are a group of assistants who promote little of the things that matter, and none of them were as important as the cook who didn't know 30 months ago when I was diagnosed with food, would he live to this day?
As he said, the situation was quite the same.
I had one of the things that was moving, and they did the surgery.
If they don't stop, it'll spread to everyone.
The situation could have been a bad time.
It'll change your mind for a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that his treatment could be started outside in early 2014, where they caused the least possible disturbance - if it could never be used in these situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the section - 20, 30, 50 times when they said there were enough steps.
That's how it started.
Fighting itself is a journey, but it makes it a little big.
Immigrantly, after the victory, the first couple had in mind Williams, who had had had had a heart attack this morning, and he had spoken a little more common in trying to handle his own hemorrhage.
Staning, who experienced the turmoil of my Captain of the Afghan Command, said: "I've been an hour-on-day this week, which may be a little over-reaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard it is for Helen and me, and also Robin, we've worked.
The three years I spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have anything, so he deserves great thanks, he's the world's best maker.
I couldn't have imagined a better business partner or a better cook.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition for five years.
A couple set up a gang that didn't surprise their competitors.
In the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close for a while.
Helen called " staying in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and we didn't try anything special at the same time.
We didn't look for any pleasure today, we were just trying to win a good deal of conflict and chaos, and we did.
A couple wait a year before they finish their future.
Glover's first in six months when he goes to his wife's TV show with Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy a moment.
"I didn't mean to say that this would be my last competition.
It would've put too much pressure on it.
After about six months in London, I learned that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It lasted about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland exchanges Panamanian Government
In October, Iceland will organise the early parliamentary elections which the rebel opinionists of Panama's data years require in the winter.
The so-called Panamanian paper revealed the taxing of many Icelandic politicians using tax apparatus.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugson's divorce for scandal, but it wasn't enough for fans.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to arrange for new parliamentary elections.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how many people’s final limit will affect the outcome of the struggle.
In June the presidential elections were clearly marked by criticism of the rulings, and the president was elected by Gudni Johnson, who was placed outside the political system.
Trump said he was a hero, claiming to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The presidential vice president of the Republic of the United States, Donald Trump, recently launched his last trial.
He said he was very proud to say that President Barack Obama would be the terrorist organization of Isis' founder and democratic advocate Hillary Clinton's participation in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic People's Party was protested and asked for an apology from Trumpil.
The army commander should never let anyone who can push down your phone like that, Clinton.
In southern France, the President of Cannes has banned the use of the most popular Burkin-Murkin-Muslim in the U.S., including the British newspaper Guardian.
In a decision signed by Prime Minister David Lisnard, it is clear that it is prohibited from leaving the coast and swimming in all those who do not have a good way and respect for secularism.
The decision also states that drug use, which is largely religious, can increase the risk of organised disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-June 85 people died and hundreds were killed in Nizza when at the age of 31, a man took France’s national day to a leading force group.
At the end of July, two orphanages connected to Isis attacked the church in North France and killed over 80 years of age a priest.
The quality of drinking water of the river of the Ouija board will pass through the valley - The oil mine of the Pykós River
The water samples taken from the official coastal waters of the coast of the island comply with the quality requirements laid down by the river basin.
Only the Pykösserve River has found a bluefin tuna land.
The Ouija board’s environmental action took heavy and medium-term water use during the Ouija board region from nine EU and 30 other general Uimar districts.
In addition to the coast of the Mediterranean, the weights of all E.coli and soybean-based entero-coke bacteria in the marine environment have been reduced by the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social and Health.
The E.coli and entero-coke concentrations of marine water were ensured as the average week in which bacterium levels were calculated below the operational limits.
The oil wells discovered by the canal of the canal are not yet waterless, but in favorable circumstances, the situation can be transformed rapidly into oil wells when the water is formed into a cooler floor.
The following state of the environment was reported for an inspection.
If the oil spill becomes a gas spill, it shall also be reported separately in the notification table.
Look at the results of drinking water samples from here.
ICT demand for forest supply: Over 80 per cent of rural farmers outside
The reduction in forestry is one change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of State resources for the first year.
The tax on income is proposed for tax reductions which would be granted on the basis of the tax on the basis of the change in the natural habitat of the forest.
In the presentation of the Ministry of State Resources, the forest supply reduction has four objectives: to promote forest change, to improve the ageing of forest owners, to increase forest logging and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote the forest economy of entrepreneurs.
The forestry operator would reduce the net income from the forest economy.
The idea of making such a work to promote forest change is good, comments by the Director of Forestry and Forestry Union (MTK), Director of Forestry and Forestry (MTK).
However, the applicant finds a critical tax revenue.
The reduction in forest supply shall be submitted for the purpose of the net income of the forestry operator.
It is the capital income that has been reduced by all other reductions.
In the view of the MTC and Hakkarian, the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the sales of wood.
The VM’s presentation shows that reducing the net income of the forestry industry is prohibited by the fact that the loss of the capital income of the forestry sector should be reduced by other taxes.
Such a person would get tax benefits even if he doesn't sell.
It's a multiplicity.
The average forester is not able to fake it, Hakkarine says.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest farmers.
The tax reduction limit for forest production is EUR 40 000.
It has been brought to the attention of Hakkari's mind too high.
As a result, he said, 82 percent of Finnish foresters were excluded from the limit of reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forestry community, he says.
The VM considers that the limit is guaranteed without the objective of growing.
The forest policy has been undermining forest supply for decades according to Hakkaris.
The result is the ageing of the forest economy community.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest farmers is now over 60 years, and about half of forest farmers are resident.
A powerful rear-view mirror surprised the car owners in Himangala - two cars stuck to their door and pushed each other.
In Himangan there was a special afternoon after breakfast.
According to the rescue facility, after two hours of driving, the car broke into the door, after which you came back after a while.
According to the day-to-day palome Harry Pyhta, I'm sure I'll be able to find a way out of the strong circle of suspicion.
In the past, there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more precise information about their complaints.
In the past, the car driver didn't give up.
The accident struck a few miles from the Himanga River on the 8th.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of food treatments
Young researchers at the University of the Market may be helped to develop more effective nutrition treatments.
The findings of the Ivaska research team, Professor Johanna Akkatemia, show that the strength of the eating plant increases the level of malnutrition.
Many people's bees, such as breastnuts, are very soft, and the bees grow usually in such an environment.
According to Ivasa, food growth could be prevented by restoring the food environment around the stomach to respond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of food treatments can be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The research results are published on 4 August in the journal Nature Communications of Solubiology.
The point of family rape continues in court, the defendant is also required to commit a murder to another author
The point of family examination of the deceased continues in court for both cases.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family surgery with Muhoks.
The other received 8 years of 4 months, including a young person, from murder and a broken robbery.
The other court is a 12-year-old prisoner of murder and armed robbery committed as a young person.
The Court also ruled on the threat of traffic security as a young person and on the right to travel as a young person.
Of the Court of Justice, the prosecutors, the experts and the judge were elected.
The defendant requires more punishment from a young man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were fully aware of the facts
According to law, 17-year-olds died as head of the school's Child Protection Unit for a man's employment in July last year.
At the age of 17, he was attacked by a judge who was sitting in the living room at the back of the hall.
The leader had gone to get out of the room and buried a young man in his room, while another young man found him in an orphanage.
The leader was also beaten, beaten, and beaten.
According to the survey, both judgements were in fact fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to leave their families from at least the previous day.
The rest of the world is a long-term slump, increasing by 156 years
The world’s longest life in the world has made sure of the remains, says a research published in Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the winter winters around Greenland, the volcano can live for 400 years.
Naaras is only 156 years old.
The rest of my life adds that it grows only within a centimetre of a year.
Only one type of symphony is known to live longer.
The researchers were able to find out how old they were with radio broadcasts.
Because of the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some of them were radioactive waste.
On their basis, the researchers were able to estimate their time.
The oldest age was evaluated 392 years - indeed a stroke in the direction of or another could be 120 years.
Donald Trump Economics - People's News
The American Donald Trump doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third country would be deprived of all tax revenues if Donald Trump’s turnover to corporate tax was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular by the most profitable tax incentives.
Trump described his tax programme as a state-of-the-art presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax fell by 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
It would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39.6, following the fall of Trump.
I'd like to be fully released from the home tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulating the country's life to competition for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The environmental standards decided by emergency must be new and the energy sector regulation must be repealed.
Barack Obaman's health care department must be re-treated.
The administration must be designated "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "dangerous" trade policy is the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
The free trade agreements would be said to be gone.
For imports from China 45 per cent and 35 per cent of Mexico would be taxed.
We're offering a new future.
Americanity, not globalism, is our religion, Trump's public.
Donald Trump, America, does not need to change the world:
American cars are coming along the streets, American planes are joining cities, American ships are taking control of the sea, American steel is bringing up new tankers all over the country.
On the other hand, Trump faithfully read through the assistants’ written speech, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including the Republicans in the vicinity - will see the United States bring the Trump programme to a serious economic recovery.
Hillary Clinton published his own program in the spring of the day in Finland.
Attack on the past - People's News
The sea is melting at once, but the main attack area lies in the middle of Madrid's caveyard, which can begin with the past.
It's where the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new history has been confirmed.
Almodovor's previous leadership work The Matkarakaskas (2013) was a small village and a coastal satirical comedy, ahead of Iho, where the Spanish-born Ur tops of life (2011).
Levelly Julieta (2016) is situated between two of them.
It's a good bond between love, human relations and family, which is between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple, and it's seen as a very long backbone.
Life is influenced by the model of the middle-aged man (Emma Suarez), but then everyone is at risk of being discouraged.
The new man (Dario Grandinnett) can always be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a short and long letter, Julie repeats the stages of her life to an adult girl.
He starts from the time before the birth of a daughter, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female head of the family will grow up as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from a TV-known series between Ommelte time (2013-2014).
The ageing of the party has been treated in a way that can be considered a curse, but I would say myself that time is difficult and meaningful in the case of repeated periods.
Almodóvar films are often so well known for the always-recognition of boredom, and also in Juliet there is a fair distance.
It is displayed with balance, delayed, a place where good music contains a place and especially a numerous movie where it is the only one with its lyrics.
Instead, the Spanish leader has a typical visual colour density and so it starts to take a little longer to his eyes in a clean shape than to act as a dramatic act.
People in the film are suffering from diseases, deaths or other immediate losses, but the surface remains the same as Korea.
This is particularly true of dressing: in the case of names, people change from face to face, and the same is true of appearance corps.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main points of the meeting are not more immediate than this.
Mechanically, the effect is external and low-spirited.
Almodóvar has made a written statement on the basis of three new Canadian novels named Alice Munron in Noble 2013.
The novels are published in the book Carculin: Stories.
Almodóvar has been involved in the dialogue, resulting in a low level of written literacy.
The only things would have been emotionally far more powerful than the drama, its big things - especially serious guilt - are dealing with the theme of the leff.
Instructions and signature: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Main characters: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinnett.
It's 12.8 from the front of the movie.
The government is trying to make a choice - People News
New cuts are not being made, the ministers are going to make sure that the fundamentals are not really falling apart.
However, the cuts made in the winter are made by the stock trade.
There's no new tapes coming.
There's already enough savings of four billion.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipil (center) and Minister for Finance Peter Orpo (total) are assured.
It should bear in mind that the VM's presentation does not contain new cuts because social security cuts have already been decided in the early summer.
Children's, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits related to national pension indexes are less than 0.85 per cent.
The period of compulsory unemployment insurance shall be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training sessions are continuing.
Aeronautics
Why are ministers so excited about not making new cuts on these?
Because the first year is the election year.
They are kept in April and are the most important heat meter in the range, they are not gallblades.
It has already been observed that the representative income of the various government parties will take longer than that of the government.
However, the Gallups claim that the government's basic government party is expected to pay a fine, although its previous election results were 12.3 per cent in comparison with the representative.
Four years ago, the fundamentalists were given a new mandate of 752 which, for most of them, was first realized early in the administration of justice.
The life expectancy of the three major governments for the same purpose is to ensure that the basic wage of the Finnish people is maintained.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the votes have been enough for government policy in the first year already.
The first signs of the use of the Group of Representatives of the Party have also come to the surface.
The fact that new cuts are not first reflected in the rhetoric is that they are made in the first year and, second, they are trying to slow down the expectations of fundamentalists.
Great events in 2018?
After a year, everything is probably different... if the Sipil government is still in its power.
The government has set the target of borrowing in this election, but Peter Orpon's budget budget will take EUR 5.9 billion for the first year, more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands that can already be in the middle of the election and admit that the government cannot comply with its own programme: debt is not paid and not even delayed.
The other one's got to stick to the program.
This means new more severe cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would run at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the winter it will be taken against what will happen.
These activities do not cover debt
It is quite clear that at present, debt does not go hand in hand, even if the Master Sipil is trying to read a positive sense.
The reports submitted by the Secretary of State in the file format by Mr Martin Hetemäen's budget shall be without prejudice to the following:
The growth growth of the world economy has repeatedly proved to be overprivileged, i.e. water aid from the international economy is not coming.
Finland’s national economy has not just risen since the collapse of 2008 except during the period of the life-threatening policy launched in the beginning of 2010.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the past decade and increased from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now amounts to EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
The debt of the public communities over 60 per cent in summer in 2014 will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the first decade.
What's responsible?
In February 2015, the claim submitted by the Left-Debt Institute was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the first year, unemployment continued to pay about EUR six billion, which is actually covered by a new debt.
This is the discussion, meeting and fundamentals of what is responsible.
Question: The King wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three of the four feel that the organization of day care, youth work and movement of children is a duty expressed in the study of the KAKS - Kingdom Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the nation will also be accountable to the individual king for books, cultures, civil authorities, construction supervision, literacy education and waste care.
In view of the country’s responsibilities, it is more likely that agriculture, special care, vocational training, vocational training and more developmental care will be provided.
I do not want to transfer any of the tasks entrusted to the public to the State.
A temporary bike break for a back-to-back decision of the police force
A 16-year-old driver was driving from the police station at Joensussa Ilomantsin Road for half a week.
The police party tried to stop the engine engine without lights, but a young man went out to drive the police overboard.
The back time went on to the Sunkajan Range, which continued to the Sorronahontia and the smaller forest where the motorcycling drove out of the road.
After this, the young man went to the river kark, but the faster the police took the cark.
The rest sheet for the driver was displayed at 0.75 prom.
He also had no car license that would have been allowed on a motorcycle.
The case shall be examined, inter alia, as a risk to traffic safety.
There's been a river in the rock.
There was a fall in the rocks in the town of Polvijärt in the town of Kaavinti in the morning of Tortai at 21.15 p.m.
The river was headed to the left side of the road in a narrow, narrow way out of the road and fell to the narrow gate.
The rescue facility received a detonated carrier from a collapsed train over the upper door with the rescue helicopter personnel and the first crew.
The car's building was the responsibility of the owner of the car.
From the roof of the roof of the hall, the road was filled with hydro oil, which the rescue device was immersing in the mud.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman died last night in the air
At 87 years of age, a woman has been in the fields of the airstrip in the South-Northern country.
The police were looking for about 105 cm long, walking and good-looking women with white hair on their heads.
Finds and instructions for lost movements are requested to call the North State Centre for Guidance No 0295440513.
Impartiality in the sky - see picture gallery of the destruction of Parafestin
The damaged food supply of parafest festivals caused a number of damages.
Mr Arto Pippuri, President of the Joensuu Parafesty Foundation, estimates that the festival will reach its economic goals and that the event can also be organised in the first year.
The last performance of Parafestin Kalle Salonen was at the end of the spring evening as a dormitory.
On Thursday, the programme will continue at 13 a.m. in the municipal theater rooms.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition from 13-15 am.
The programme is planned.
The pollutant is born in the open air when your seeds and its pressure begin to drop down.
The changes in the form of open water are associated with heat, and thus the drop in air is slow and the earth is rapidly moving toward it.
Aircraft plant tells us that food poisoning occurs in Finland several times during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the search engine.
The search tour of Parafestin was held at the back of Joensuu in the morning before five o'clock.
Three rooms fell into a coma, and there were about 200 people in the rooms.
In case of an accident, you're gonna have to break up with four people.
In the course there was one child who was transported gently to continued treatment.
Aeronautics
According to the study, Western skin is getting older at a lower rate.
That's why they're getting old. They're airborne.
The British research tells Evening Standard.
The British company Caci analysed London without the most sensitive minors and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many long-term Western skin is two and a half years older than even a farmer living in the countryside.
The quality of the old-fashioned minors is a very beautiful fuel supply that is the source of the transport fuel.
The same cuts also cause respiratory problems, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 per year.
Studies have found that small amounts of particles are needed to pass through the most important part of the body.
In the Cacin study, an early parenting was found to be a risk, especially for those who are working on their job in the vicinity of the crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example in different nams, but more practically, by recommending regular cleaning.
The tractor's tracks were wrong. You'd be in front of a man's sex.
The man was moving on a stone tractor in his backyard.
When she got out of the tractor and went ahead of it, the tractor's wheels went wrong and the tractor hit the man.
The man did not leave it, but the tractor, however, was driven by a man who was heavily injured by the fact that he was transported to the central bank as a result of ongoing research.
The tractor didn't blow up for longer, because it jumped in front of the rocks.
Renewable for the Future
In the capital of the capital city, Liiga-Riento, a co-founder, will start a series that will start in October with a better starting point than with men.
The group's been in cash for nearly three weeks.
A common layer is found to be safer than the previous one, where the row ships have been sinking to Rienno.
Jani Säis, who continues to be the chief contributor of the Rienno, is invited to become a new group of companies and to become one.
The international centralists, Fred Musoni, begin their second journey in Rienno.
New plants are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson is 205 centimetre sugar produced in the area of the farm.
Garchet is a passenger. Brazilian has 198 cents.
By Josban, Kataja and Jokikiki in the U.S.
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the sales band MM since 2003.
Today, Tampere has already had six rounds, only 2013 remained in the middle of Canada's better North American casinos.
I was working in the market and playing in the backyard of women when I saw a report.
The U.S. was in the process of establishing a subgroup of sales companies.
I've been interested in it, and here it is now, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family changed when the daughter of Helsinki grew old.
In 1987, Jumppane was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuuu, this kind of guy wasn't played at the SM level as well as Salibandy.
He was playing the game at the university.
I played in Katia's corps and later in Jokis's ice cream in the SM series, remember Jumppane.
Jumppane played the SM series of salary from 1991 to 92, the following three through the course of Josbas.
At the end of the game, he was preparing to follow the A girls into the master's room.
The women's SM story was lifted up in 1995.
All of his Jumppane played through the SM 10 series of women, adding 169 to the score 51+34=85.
The latest SM show is 2001-2002.
Parttu Pusca and Tatu Väne were appointed to the rural group
Joensulouse's payroller Josban grew Perttu Pusca and the real-time Tatu Vänne was elected to the Finnish real estate group, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT market from 6 to 8 November.
In Helsinki, a 25-year-old attacker in Pertu Pusca has played this before six men's landings, where he's had total operations 9+4=13.
At 32 years of age, a 32-year-old Swedish Wiler-Erisgeni, a defence officer, Tatu Vänen, has made a difficult journey and is part of the rural population insurance company's 117 farming experience.
The event was also called the Song of the Players' Concordance, Mika Kohonen, who was seen in Finland last time in the MM series of December.
As head of the Salibandy country team, Contio-Catunen works.
Beach Volley - Teatour Essi Hasun surrounding Kouvola - SM-culta missing reward cap
The first Hasu is to end as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the end of the course.
Beach volleyballs in Finland will be solved by weekend at the Couvola Sports Expo.
For three days, metal is played on both adult and young rows.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airports and the Finnish Airport for the organisation of the SM final market each row will be awarded six best pairs.
The local color in the tournament represents the growth of Elimäen NMKY by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball games for many years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is waiting for exciting games in front of the public.
Hopefully as many as possible will arrive at the weekend view.
There's probably a good place for the Pess stadium.
I'm not very often played in the adult series, so it's great to play in fine homes, Hasu felt.
The cobblestone wall burned down the Hasun's cricket dance and gave the good eves to a great surprise.
As a child, you have good memories.
I started the airport at the age of 9 in the E-mail of Elimäen NMKY.
The main thing is that there are too many games in mind, in the noses, spins of dust, and soft briefs and choreographs after the score, Hasu remembers.
In a small village, there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s associates created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were firmly engaged in the work - the father of the team teammate prepared us and our mother was a long-term vice president.
The first Hasule beach volley has already been a natural variety of nature as a counterweight in the interior.
It's been played since the 1990s by the U.S. Navy.
The operation has always been active.
I also went on my own to follow up on the part of the young SM tour, thinking that I would play there myself one day.
Now this attack will take place when Hasu plays at the weekend together with a long-distance Anna Parkis in the SM finals.
In the second round of the exchange between the State of Latvia and Taru Lahden, there is a clear objective of the two sides.
As a real goal, we have a measure.
We still lack SM gold, Hasu throws valuablely.
The appearance of the weekend in Kowulola may be the last known public meeting for Hasul.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in the civil service.
Yes, the end of the international storm is after Kiskalelli's turn.
On the other hand, security is being set up at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The search center dropped buildings in the event of the hurricanes in Joensusus, the magnitude was close
The search tour ended in three rooms at the famous Parafest Festival in Joensusus.
According to the newspaper Karjalais, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
It is estimated that there were about 200 people in the rooms.
There was a show in one large room.
Two rooms were smaller.
An accident occurred on Friday at 7:00 p.m.
The day-to-day journalist Markus Witaniemi tells the paper that in this case there were the causes of immeasurableness.
Well, I'm sure it's still going to be a trial.

Solomon Koli courageously went as a farmer
Agriculture as a company means risks, flexibility and flexibility.
Young farmer Solomon Koli, 25 became a farmer because he also believed in a positive future in the land.
Koli started about two years ago with his little brother Valttari Koli, who continued his activities as a member of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as an entrepreneur meant increasing debt and status so that the company could get out of agriculture.
This has been from a little boy until it happened to me.
I've always been excited about the earth, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it should be done in the right way.
In 2013, we went to build a platoon pool, and at first the bank had not been inspired by it.
However, I went to the project with real courage and had been there full of it, Solomon Kol tells me that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli’s growing meat cars is to invest even more heavily in his nest.
The work has produced results because Solomon Kol has been selected to the ten best groups in the future of the Earth in the competition of the young food producer.
At best, he competes for a possible victory.
He'll be able to vote on the page by 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July.
This is the highest reading for the year (after June 2012) and the first reading over zero after the last year, where a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The annual annual average inflation measured at the rate of the living cost index was -0.8 % over the last 12 months (October 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (October 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016 the life price index was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
From the beginning of the year (June 2016 compared to December 2015) inflation rate was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), private goods and services (0.3%).
Prices are low in clothing and feet (2.2%), expenditure, economic needs and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as last month for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchatin "anime" is thought to be an asymptometic.
According to Snapchat, our mother has acted as an inspirational source of inspiration, but some observers say it is racist.
Using its lens tools, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a mother, a dog or a bitch who agreed to the land of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lins are simple, growth-friendly tools that produce more than 30 million improved jobs per day.
All of the shark sharks will quickly end up in public documents.
The Snapchat lens is previously assessed by a claim that the application mentions blackface, i.e. "shutting" machine or prefers to be white-coloured as a beauty product.
So when Snapchat mentioned this week to some users, who gave them wines, wines and bottles of poskets, some critics called it a racist form of caricaty from Asian people - "to be caught" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these two countries could not be a sign of the greater problem of diversity in the company.
News and misinformation spread to the public on Wednesday through The Vergen and Motherboard reports, the day later Snapchat said that he had lost his property.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant to be an expression of respect for animonymity, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the experienced observers of racism, the lens was a reminder of toxic stereotypes in action.
The others strongly rejected the comparison of the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art specialist who was widely distributed on Twitter, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least boring and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to say against the comparison that there are a rather complex asymptocratic theory and the strengths of the instrument".
It shows that the counsel is not just to be confused, but to be exposed to extreme delinquency.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural grounds.
The American culture seems to be attached to the endless campaign of diversity and acceptance, of the corporate meeting rooms of Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And the great, round-the-clock audience of the most diverse young people of Snapchat can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding position.
Twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in a toaster that when one of the Snapchat's lens creates an image of the user, "these guys have a lot more difficult to be noticed".
As Torstaina Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for the Media, decided to remove his Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his letter to the Media and in his phone call, he said that the fast-paced Snapchat practices are recognizable without diversity.
Zhu appreciated the company's chief white leader and decided to write on his hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Even if they do not have a variety of human representation in their personality, why they can make such decisions," Chinese American Zhu said, "or they have different human beings at work, but they are not in a position where they would feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unresponsive.
The company shall not publish a list of the diversity of its staff, taking into account its status as a private undertaking.
In Torstaina Snapchat, he refused to discuss his staff's concerns, but according to the representative, the company later hired the recruiter to focus on the disadvantaged people and to carry out internal integration efforts.
In part, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed in addition: "Even if they actually need more like our users, they can say that this is not okay."
According to the Congress panel, the military officers misappropriated Isis information
In a report published in Torstana, the Congress panel said that the United States Army Chief of the Armed Forces would report on the use of a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria, as it was justified on the ground.
The report of the President of the Committee on Defence of the House of Representatives of the Republican President, the Scientific Committee and the Working Group established by the Committee on Monetary Affairs found that "wide dissatisfaction" was found in a group of headmaster's research analysts who said that the presidents rejected their assessment of the American efforts to win Isis.
The chief known as Centcomina is President of the Armed Forces in Florida Tampa, which oversees United States operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The decisions adopted by the leaders of the highest-valued Centcom were typically more positive than those of the United States against terrorism than the facts on the spot were justified; they were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other authors of the Information Society," said the paper.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our combatants suffer in the war when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision makers," said the representative of Ken Calvert, my Republic of California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership is due to an organization's failure.
The 10-year report describes in detail the practical problems of the headmaster's painting and analysis efforts in the United States to train Irish teams in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value authorities of the Government of Obama would have designated reports to be misleading, it describes the feelings of analysts as if the leaders of Centcom had put pressure on them to describe the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many of the headline press releases, opinions and testimonies for the Congress were significantly more positive than they were in themselves," the report said.
The Centcom authorities, for example, publicly stated that the massive attack on Mosul to return to power could begin even early in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After a month's study, this is very clear," said representative Mike Pompeo, my Republic of the Nations, in his opinion.
During the mid-2014 period, the highest-valued research director of the U.S. military area of the capital of the United States of America maneuvered the intelligence products of the capital to reduce Isis’ risk in Iraq.
The Republicans agreed with the Working Group that analysts had shown concern that information from the Islamic State was manipulated.
The report published in Torstena follows the broader results of the study in the course of its work.
The Ombudsman of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an overarching, ongoing investigation into Centcom's information.
The members of the Committee on Democratic Affairs of the House of Representatives would declare their own findings to be consistent with the conclusions of some of the Group's final conclusions.
"Centcom created a process that was separated between 2014 and 2015, between Isis and Iraq's security forces," said the Committee's representative Adam B. Schiff, a democratic leader.
According to Schifff, this process "expected the publication of research findings", made the problem worse in the middle of the analysis and did not "give enough room for different views".
Schiff and Democrats said that they had not found evidence that the White House would have tried to stress the Centcom analyses to agree with their conclusion "set out or politically".
The Daily Beast reported on the results of the convention’s study.
Last August The New York Times reported that the reviewer of the Pentagon had begun the investigation following the complaints of the Centcom analysis.
Mr Patrick Evans, the representative of the Pentagon, said in his opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the study of the inspector was under way.
But he said that "experts differ in their views on the interpretation of information in a variety of ways, and the Community and the Ministry of Science and Defence hold a healthy dialogue on these essential subjects of national security".
The investigation has other follow-up penalties than what is to be asked whether the United States-led bombings are successful in Iraq and Syria (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
The last year's complaints raised the question of how much President Obama can trust the President's real assessment of the war operations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The assessment of the Islamic state's intelligence reflects more than ten years of controversy when Centcom's research analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the responses of several analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported a small army in Iraq and used very little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also involved in the opening role of the Spanish government.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite its daily public opinion, air-conditioning against the government's rulings were not significantly weakened by the economy of the terrorist group, since it had built temporary branches to sell oil through black powder.
However, the Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the capital.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of war.
General Austin retired in April, and in his position General Joseph L. Votel came to his office.
The United States will win a fourth round of women's paychecks with Britain
The day after he had made three maps for the Japanese 6-1 team, Katie Bam made a toast to the U.S. women's first two maps for the American winning India 3-0.
Five paintings in two games sound unforgettable of achievement, but at the age of 27, Bam said he had not been sure he had done the same before.
"I don't have any idea," he said.
"I'm not really a man who has to write from his land."
But he knows this: Americans are in the 4-0 situation in the Olympics market and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still undisputed after winning Japan's 2-0 tournament.
Britain and the United States will meet on Sunday at the last game of the first round.
Both groups have been identified in the fourth grade, and this game decides who is the first and who is the second in their six groups.
Firstly, the investors avoid strong Dutchmen, the leader of the second group, a little longer than four-year-olds.
As the game ends on Sunday, the Americans have woke up with their amazing success here, four years after they left London for the last 12 groups.
Bam was there for the team.
He grew up in Pennsylvania Blue Bellis and was the first time in his hands as a 3-year-old (his parents played two-year-olds in Drexel) in his 16-year-old rural group, where he became a player of all ages.
He wasn't involved in the Olympics in 2008, because he didn't get his final player.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, the English Craig Parnham was appointed a preparatory officer, and things began to change.
"Culture change, soul change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same jobs in London as we have now.
We've made a perfect rule.
On Thursday evening, Bam started the first half of the painting on the rock floor near the ground.
India had come to the game without any victory in the tournament, but the group was very hard and held the situation in 1-0 reading to the third party until Bam took care of the situation.
He drove the ball to the left of the field, then turned to the center and pushed the ball onto the ground outside of the American 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added four more on the other side of the last floor.
This football game was the first American football match to Jackie Briggs, who had won one in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the final outcome of the game.
The peace of trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Ocean
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on their way.
The events of Rio de Janeiro are perceived as persistent and unwarranted, aggressive in the message of competition and effort.
Just like the Olympics themselves, it would be a moving visual field that is intertwined with frequent storms and powerful currents to triathlonists.
It is impossible to set up a TV, read a dictionary or listen to a conversation on the coffee line without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic primary and future heart attacker, could well be one of the names of all the people who are presented at the best time of sight and who are suffering from sponsors and good minds TV-motors - if he was a vampire, a power worker or even a bully.
But Dooley, who lives at home from the California Lake Forest, 28, competes with the Olympics on trampoline.
The Olympics don't light all kinds of things as much.
Longer in the middle, partly hidden, are the types that not all are generally accepted: air-conditioning, frequency, lock-up, roof-wondo.
We've always had a pain in the ass for as long as it lives.
But if I can make an accurate number out of my special features, I would like to draw attention to the slowing power of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic since 2000, when it has taken its first place in Sydney, its presence between the past 16 years has been so low that many who have been challenged have not realized that it is an Olympic type.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in these types, it has never won this prize, and its athlete has not won the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share the myths of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna are defending London's cult.
However, Trampoline is associated with a certain time-consuming trend, partly because it sounds better to the uncivilized reward than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an indefinable fan.
There are opportunities for interest in the law, as is seen in the color of endless bombs of border movies, but there are also the nature of power and firefighting, two types that are in principle combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means to take action.
The goalors of the Mastership are to push the abandoned trampoline up to nearly 30 yards high, and they must carry out tight business lines (translations, tires and tires) and finally down to their feet.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "airtime".
Russia competes 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The general approach of the Olympics is directly ahead.
What desires must go into their search for gold longer, faster, higher and more - sometimes to the ground, sometimes I prefer to go around the field.
They are not only in the forest but also in television news, but also in other diverse borders: global or Olympic.
This specific goal is to walk, admire and even fanatical, and it can even get into the eyelids.
But it's also the reason why looking at these monkeys can be a little curious.
Trampoline offers a break from this.
Trampoline is up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The competitor adapts to a new rise with no pressure like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then inevitably up again.
Of course, this does not involve competition and difficulty, but there is no gruesome turn towards the end of the programme, no hypnosis to the distance, only time and stress, a constant interruption.
It's as close to the Zen style as it can be found in the Olympics.
Women's carcinomas and then the final will be held on Friday evening at 9:00 p.m. (ET) and men's cheeses will also be served on Sunday at 13:00 p.m.
NCBs shall send finals as part of their evening programme from 14 am to 14 am.
In the middle of the Olympic Games, they offer a quiet, exciting moment that is most likely not noticed in the general event.
And if knowledge is achieved only by providing men with inspiration and representation (as U.S. men's ministers once proposed in The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new fans.
"The Skull Shows His Mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-term U.S. alliance
Impartial Opinions in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has been the subject of violent opposition from the government.
Observers say that ten interested parties have been shot dead in contact with the police.
Is Ethiopia in a state of disintegration?
During the last decade it has been one of Africa’s poorest countries, a western country’s allies, whose economy is rapidly growing.
In recent months, however, the anti-government opinions have continued to spread the country to more and more areas.
Only last week were thousands of people around the streets asking for a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was unassailable.
The observers said that the police had shot and killed dozens of unarmed fans.
The video that is believed to be at the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year shows how security authorities beat young people at the same time when they were forced to stand up against the wall.
The United Nations Chief Justice Office is now required to carry out a thorough investigation.
"Keeping with this country was always difficult, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project head of the African team at the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most powerful country in Africa, and westerners appreciate its stability.
American military and research services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorism in the region, especially in Somalia, and there is no African country that can help so many Westerners.
Ethiopia's economy has grown with an efficient pace.
Its infrastructure has improved greatly, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new job market.
The city's ruins are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organizations have continued to talk about the nature of the government, the country's opposition has been limited, and the rest of the world has been affected effectively.
Many have been deported from the country, imprisoned, killed or thrown into concentration camps for a long time.
But this can be a change.
"If you hurt people and they don't have other options than to show their minds, they'll have to go," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows his mind.
One generation shows its opinion.
The elections are numerous and cover all the use of the coalition to the collapse of the government.
The ruling party after the many critical elections in the last few years has finally been opposed to the place to which it is taking control of all the places in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the border with Eritrea. The war on this vast and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less refined over the last few years, may try to use hunger to accept and rearm.
The closing factors explain why after the death of the above surface for a few years, the deep feelings are now being aroused.
The first effect is without danger: brainphones.
In the last few years, a large number of Ethiopian people have been able to communicate through social media when the worst telephone calls have become public and Internet service has improved.
Although the government would close access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during its comments, many people can still communicate via local media services.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this was how they met for an opinion.
Second, two large ethnic groups, Russians and amharas in Ethiopia will be better able to act.
The roses and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, Amharas, who came from Ethiopia’s mostly Christian overnights, went through politics and business to accept the arguments that many are Muslims and live in areas.
But it's also changing.
"We are on our way towards organizing under one bridge," said the Russian leader Mulatu Gemechu.
Most of the impressions have been made in the area of amrah and rhommo.
Many amrahs and Romans think that Ethiopia is unjustly owned by the tiger country. The nation covers about six percent of the population and controls weapons, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason for non-proliferation is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former Captain, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical neuron, a man who saw the hills around him.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to detect early non-compliance signs and to use secret agents to make opposers undeterred.
"The government doesn't have a basic answer like that," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was forced to fill Meles's reach with a relatively unknown lack of knowledge.
Unlike Meles, who was home to North Ethiopia's tiger region, Haenameriam is south.
Analysts say the security services of the tigers don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased blood circulation.
For the previous time, Ethiopia was in the grip of such a death in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the choices that led to an analysis that the government first collapsed and then broke them.
As a result, many thinkers died, although less than in recent months, and this period of inexhaustibility ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have highlighted Ethiopia's leaders with a view to infrastructure planning such as new unemployment and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the internal power of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
In the past six months, activists in the Amhara city of Gondara have attacked the competition of tiger owners, and hate against tigers is becoming increasingly common in the social media.
Analysts say that the opinions of the U.S. and other Western allies are based on the summit.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as an airport for flights to neighboring Somalia, although it was said some time ago to close this airport.
Although the Westerners clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want to be ready for the collapse of their allies in the region.
"This," said Abdi, "it's a real balance."
Donald Trump explains that Obama-based father-in-law's argument "sarcass"
Donald J. Trump tried to undermine his last campaign last Friday by claiming that he was not real when he read several stories this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders".
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the President-in-Office to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also set up its advocate, who have striven to defend him during a turbulent period of time, a challenge in which they must explain the facts that he does not necessarily mean.
After the guidance given at the midweek campaign meeting, Trump said the same was becoming more and more enthralled in the challenges he felt that his purpose was indeed to say that President Clinton and Isis had promised.
However, in the Twitter post of an earlier holiday, Trump said he was just a boxer.
The publication was complete on the previous day when Trump said in many of his trials that he was really serious about the charge.
When Conservative Radio Director Hugh Hewitt tried to help the trumpeting by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the presidential president of the Republic took this to his hearing corps.
The latter will be in a situation in which Trump has tried to refocus its campaign on its economic impact.
Trump and Clinton were fighting for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
In addition to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he was supposed to speak out as a stimulant.
Trump used to use the cross-sectional defense.
Later in July, after he had received a wide range of consideration when he proposed that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying "I'm sure I'm pregnant".
The approach will allow Trump to use his political speech at the borders and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'explanation' to the direction or to the reaction of others," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both proposals.
But I also think that he is weak in his opinions and knows that they are too limited to be able to pass through many different lenses.
Instead of lowering its forest for a large voter, Trump has been more bolder in the last few days when his advice has continued to decline.
A new, spring release published by the NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump was suffering from severe hunger following Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that there is a severe drought in Florida.
Although Trump is primarily trying to avoid requests for forgiveness on provable matters, he often accuses his critics of mishandling his words or of misinformed his own sense of humor.
In his view of the ongoing review of the presidential campaign during the past few months, the troops of Trump have forced their loyal allies to fail in their position, where they must publicly support him regardless of how provulsive his observations are.
In New York, former President Rudolf W. Giuliani, one of the most important supporters of Trump, saw a lot of difficulty in defending the proposed CNN challenge.
"I believe that he says there are real, political comments," Giulian said when he was asked about the authenticity of the trumpet claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It is true that before Obama Isis was an unknown, small organization he called amateur, completely afraid, and that's why it happened, because he got rid of Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to argue that the Government of Obaman, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isis to decline because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania convention, Trump continued his attacks on Twitter on the media that beat him up as he said and were on his side.
He picked up "bad, exciting" television experts who are trying to get out of him to say "They're not successful!"
Some democracies have challenged the fact that Trump is a new evidence that he is not in agreement with the President.
Previous Closed Coffee Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a nude, just an acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was not an unlimited network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, your fallen Bedford Avenue went too expensive.
The movement that replaced Verb during 2014, Soap Cherie, sells the cupcakes.
The locals killed it as a last resort in the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is about change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is confused and Verb is now a stock trade."
But if New York is about change, it's about finding it again.
The Saved Verb was opened last November to Greenpoint, below the base of the original location.
The new Verbis has wifi and it can pay on credit cards, but part of the staff is still the same and there is the same feeling that it has.
Coffee's still good.
New Verbi is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, an old-time coffee worker who is the owner of a new place and head.
He started in Verbis in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in his new location, he said he was in his heart.
Rodriguez, 36, a small mountain on the ground.
Verb uses the same means of delivery and buys the same espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new materials.
The food list is found on the canal-cancannon-coagulation line, and in the mains it offers, for example, peaches and crushed sicillus.
There's plenty of rice in there.
There's no more fruit in the coffee shop, but there's a little meat there.
For nine months Rodriguez has been saying that he has seen old customers in the same office.
"Williamburg went too expensive for many former customers," she said.
One of the last few weeks of Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and regularly visited Verbis.
After she changed to Greenpoint, she went to the coffee shop.
He says that after Werbin's shut down, he's been off the coffee shop for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verbin's coffee and culture," she said.
Now she has returned to the coffee couple, even though that day she was wearing a traditional chai-juma mixed instead of her coffee, which is one of the new additions.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has faithfully visited Verbis since 2003.
He went there before he worked, and he always did the same job.
"Every day of the fifteenths, more than seven, regularly than an hour, I went in and they were preparing mausoleums for me," he said.
Photo, Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new materials to the food list.
Today, Rosenthal is still doing his usual job, but sometimes because of his change, he's in the mood with a nice bagel, an egg and a cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a beautiful shoe shop that took care of old houses.
In fact, Soap Cherien's owners offered to prepare Verbil a special cup of coffee to be used as a substance.
"I think we can still stick to the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional semi-finals have also accepted coffee.
One of these new customers turned into food, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to set it up soon so that he could get his new neighbors to know his condition well.
There are other benefits in the new location.
The local place of entertainment wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
It's possible that the coffee will expand to the next building.
For many customers, it's enough that they get their old favorites in the new Verbis.
Joseph White was a state-of-the-art client and said he was discouraged when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, White said she felt like she was coming home by going inside and making coffee.
"I've been trying to make it smell," she said.
A Square Meal: lunch to live
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room.
In his pride, President Roosevelt had excellent food for the Fifth Avenue, such as the gas station, and Maryland's spare parts.
On that day, his choice of food was more demanding: filling plants with tomatoes, roots, and pastries.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
And his half brother Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The parishes in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coen's last book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese bread in America, and Ziegelman told me about living from the Lower East Side account of food through his book 97 Orchard.
Their new collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes in the 1980s, is a story of American bread during the great famine in the 1930s.
By referring to some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at the Daily Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unsanitary restaurant in the Fletron region, which has been operating since the spring of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, took the dose at the foot, at the base and at the plants.
When the supplier asked for meat, the parishioner considered it appropriate to discuss eating meat.
"The disturbances were very popular," Ziegelman said.
It was a land mine, a payroll, a pumpkin.
They were made of preparations and some of the bad substances that continued to be the primary ingredient.
Imagine that you ate so many potatoes that they would form your daily food.
Coe irvisi.
"I'm sure it's felt like a lousy bear," he said.
In the years leading up to famine on the American table, especially on the farm, was like food-to-be-to-life-new table.
Women’s groups provided food for male workers on the ground, and milk was offered at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war.
"Then came a central, worrying issue to the Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write it.
One concern was a new, successful choice of food: Mysteries classes, such as concerns and quality, became the main food, and the table was "the cool way to use food utensils", said Ziegelman, as the tastes were able to hide less attractive substances under the German box.
The small fruits were replaced by the worst dried fruits.
From a meat that had been in the center of American restaurants for years, a life-threatening excretion product was obtained.
Special ingredients were tested with calorie and fatty weight more important than flour or even whole juice in the kitchen.
In the course of the study, Ziegelman also prepared a food chain for a book containing recipes, which filled revealed sips in the soil.
"It wasn't recommended for more dinner," Coe said.
Ziegelma's answer was, "It was an inconsequential."
The earth’s surface does not fit any of its surfaces.
This was natural for many households.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Affairs Office from 1923 to 1943, guided more than ever before or after.
In public recipes and articles, they would encourage women to start "budgetists" and respond to the challenge of transforming spaghetti and porcupines into food supplements.
A Square Meal is a historic feast.
There are reports of the government's reaction to hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover, to let me eat two of yours.
At the same time as he publicly surpassed his childhood by simple, ioval food, he ate as a wonderful millionaire who had come from him.
"He was looking for a mannerful bread, like a fish pie," Coe said.
He ate close to gold at the dining room on the couch.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example to himself.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economic operator who had no interest in sleeping, the White House came from a place that "did not only offer the most difficult food in Washington but also the most expensive food prepared."
Many of the petals were abandoned as soon as the country returned to its feet.
The tradition is that we continue to focus on fish and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in practice, how science is applied to food.
The parish said that when they wrote a letter, they were better able to understand Ziegelman’s mother’s diet, for example, how she could not get out of it.
"He was really afraid of food poisoning," Coe said.
Ziegelma remembered, "He even got sick of people."
There's been an intermittent incident.
After the dishes were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe showed up at the follow-up table that they had prepared at home: the grass-roots meal that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called an animal sacrifice," Ziegelman added that the general attack was given to the unrequired recipient's name.
There was no exchange of cereals in the follow-up area, only leaves, a little flour, sugar, water and cane.
They were all willing to put their trust in their fate, their Russian list.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe santas you once and again.
He told his wife: "A few very well-known Germans could help."
For Gilead, expert costs are replaced by hepatitis C for Mercki
In the United States, the Competition Court has found that Gilead Sciences Inc has been entitled to receive expert costs incurred by the treatment of patients with hepatitis C in order to obtain medical advice from doctor Merck & Co Inci.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars for the crimes committed by two Mercki patents associated with Gilead’s successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. This release resulted from the failure of the U.S. judge to find Mercki’s false claims and other unfair practices.
In a trial in Torstena, U.S. businessman Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the fines it brought against it.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which manages the market for new hepatitis C strains, which can clearly improve more than 90 percent of patients with this disease.
The case is based on 2013 when both Gilead and Merck challenged their second right to the possession of the active substance of the medicinal product at Gilead on the basis of sofosbuvir.
United States support groups say they've been completely dominated by the Isis regime, Manbi.
In the United States, supported groups have ruled all around the northern city of Manbì, which is bordering Turkey, after the last Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian democratic groups (SDF) were now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city was removed.
The groups had released more than 2000 civilians who were considered prisoners of war, Sharfan Darwish SDF's allies, Manbbi's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The town is now under our control, but we've been doing research on it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax report, which showed that the presidential presidential election and his share of income in that year were $10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015 the Clintons contributed a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton served nearly $5.3 million, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million customers from Simon & Schuster, who told his wife in the Foreign Ministry.
Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, would have published 10-year tax statements.
In 2015, their actual Union tax rate was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are measuring the economic viability of Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier said in his opinion.
In contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false facts and sets out his previous promises to publish his tax notices.
The President-in-Office of the United States will, as I say, publish its tax notice even if the law does not require it.
The New York businessman Trump has brought the tax administration into the process of auditing the tax notices for refusing to publish them.
"For your sake," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said in his Twitter release a link to the tax announcements of a democratic candidate.
Torstaina, Special Representative of Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he did not allow Trump to publish them before the audits are ready.
The Critics of Trump, including the President of the Republican Mitt Romney and other Republican Members of the Republic of 2012, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his gifts of charity, his business and numerous other interests, for example, in Russia.
Clinton has been exposed to the problem as a public prosecutor on the website of the Republican authorities who call on the authorities to publish their tax.
In Torstana, he got into a problem with his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for the past ten years: his tax notice has been published," he told the public.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid one or very little tax in the 1990s, and the New York Times Business College has published its bill on the basis of numerous tax auditors and bookkeepers who said that the situation could still be the same.
There has been a problem in the presidential elections of the federal state.
Clinton has supported the rule adopted by billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that over a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 per cent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska in Omaha last week, Buffett, where the Berkshire Hataway Conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax notices.
Buffett said he was also having a tax administration check on him, and that Trump didn't "fuck" the tax agency, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax notices by 2007.
The actual tax rate of Clintons in New York’s Chappaqua was approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
In 2015, Clinton’s tax report showed that only $100 of their income was paid, unlike most of the Americans.
Their investment target was a good, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 share and share income.

The Chilean divisions and electronics enhance the protection of Tanzania's nervous system
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unusual market to prevent young people from turning to human institutions - they kill animals in their nests filled with chili-like condoms.
Keino has proved to be effective, and several years ago the idea of finding together with the United States Nature Conservancy Foundation has enhanced its popularity by training free people in northern Tanzania to use violence-free four stages to meet home and hundreds without animals being harmed.
Many people used to use knives to protect themselves.
On Friday is the world's birthday dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we've developed... tools, we've found a change of attitude in these communities. They're now much more reliable than they can keep them out of fear without harming them," said Managing Director Damian Bell in his opinion.
The first two steps shall be included in the box showing the adjustable angle and the sound of the tower.
If it doesn't stop the animal, it's called "chilipper."
The condom is filled with a mixture of Chilean and the country and by electronic means, followed by the condom is closed so that only the surface remains visible.
When a condom is burned, it relaxes in anger and sprays the chili peppers with air.
One case is usually sufficient to send the ring to the other.
The last way is by the floor that shoots without a Roman belt. The result is a loud, church explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticised the Berlinian hotels that removed Israel's Arab target number
A French-Jewish filmmaker released a press release to the audience that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's target number.
Claude Lanzmann, who reported on the Holocaust, wrote an open letter in the German FAQ publication by Kempinski Bristol, Berlin.
During his brief stay, Lanzmann tried to find an Israeli hotel to provide a list of country destinations.
However, the country has not been mentioned in a group of countries where it can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, New Germany’s capital, Israel has been removed and sanctified?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
In his search for an explanation, the photographer took the matter to the hotel counter.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was "crushed him."
The receptionist at the hotel said there was a decision taken by the Kempinski Hotel Board.
The reason behind the decision was even more confusion among filmmakers.
"Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's target number," says the employer.
In the letter from the German Republic of Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "big mistake", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were scared and shocked because of the case.
It's already a big mistake.
But it's even more embarrassing to see you in Germany and in this hotel room.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We're waiting for the hotel to make the right decisions," the official said.
The incident caused quite a response on the network when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "adjusted" the claims of Arab customers.
"Be ashamed," said another publication, which noted that a beautiful hotel located on the Kurfurstendam street stood near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly cleared all charges and called the event "inaccurateness" and "please forgive" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"The order to be excluded from Israel's long list of elections has never been made," said the representative of Kempinski, according to Suddeutche Zeiting.
It adds that the target number has now been added.
The police used gas and ammunition to attack Brazilian students
The students took turns attending Mass together with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when the students gathered to show their interest in the government’s reform of the public education system.
The police used gas and explosives against fans.
The problems began when lawmakers tried to start a school team, which led to police use of coal and coal gas.
Hundreds of thousands of students were involved in an opinion poll to express their fears.
According to the proposals made by the Governor of State Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the opinion were seen writing to the walls of the interim President Michel Temer's graffiti.
This last statement of interest occurred only days after the sponsors moved into the movement as a group to support President Dilma Rousseffa of the country in the vote of the Senate on his office.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is increasing suddenly 71%
After the removal of packages, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Russia’s major representative of Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Following the removal of international commitments against Iran, Russian companies have shown great interest in business activities in the country, he said.
The Russian companies will continue to be located in Iran while the new companies are ready to access the market.
"Probably one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 with a total of 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russia was exported to Iran by 91.5 per cent with a total of $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran rose by 16 per cent to $158 million.
"The growth of copper was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," he said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is waiting for this year for a preview of Iranian tourists to Russia.
In recent years, Russia's foreign minister in Iran has given its citizens some 35,000 visas for the main journey.
Iran was also the first time in a group of 20 countries, most of which are tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that in Russia last year the number of Iranian politicians is going to be falling apart," he said.
At the same time, almost few Russians are visiting Iran, which the great envoy hopes to change.
"I was able to personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shirazin and Yazd, where old Persian civilization has been preserved in good health," he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner ate on the ground while the British landed on a bike
Scotland's Callum Skinner praised the men's group press for the last night at the Rio Rounding Stadium, when the third of the British team was to be mastered from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old woman from Glasgow who was home there was a weak role in which her school colleague Sir Chris Roy was well-adjusted, the legend was a young high when it hit the ground with a win-win at the New Zealand team.
The British took a shock strike four years ago, while Hoy won a fifth of his sixth Olympics.
And they returned to the pellet investment in the World Championships in London for six March, even though Hoy has since decided to compete.
The problem between Beijing and London was the Special Envoy Jamie Staffin's replacement.
This could have been fulfilled just in the time when the Hindus appeared.
The high end also created the trash that Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from Britain's manufacturers who were trying to catch up with the potential that's now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the masterhood with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner performed the Olympics in times of time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the Briton won the gold of the double.
The price was right after his turn, but Kenny jumped to the lead of the team, and Skinner was holding it.
The strategy change was a major part of the change, and this included the Hindu movement in a huge exchange so that she could slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner to stick to their will.
Keep track of your position as a BBC expert and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they took their payroll.
23-year-old glassgowlain Skinner said, "The interview is amazing."
I'm just here to do my best and get my reputation.
We did the final Olympics and won the World Championships.
It was sometimes incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 by Kenny and Hoy on the Hindu coast, he admitted that he wanted to fall into the race after a bad start.
Later he made his comments back, and the British competition partners have not been elected.
This time there was no problem with the triumph of the superpower.
He said, "It felt like he was in London when there were so many Ison-British shoes on his feet."
As a group, we found contact over the last three months.
We've destroyed so many world empires, so it's just great to win the Olympics again.
One event, one for the nation of goldsmiths who won seven out of all ten horsemen, both in Beijing and in London.
If this describes the development of the last five months, we will be expected to succeed in the five-day cycle stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's goodness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's pride, winning three Olympics in one Olympic.
This would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (that is apparently the holy day in the British Games, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farahin and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would raise the total number of metals by six and a half.
It would be the same as Hoylla.
Kenny competes next in the race that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed this one now.
Group competition is always the best.
It'll be won together with friends.
The only victory is really said to be one."
The Hindus said, "If he wins the other two cults, he should be given the value of the guitar."
This was one day's only medal competition, but Britain got more news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul were the fastest four souls in time, four kilometers in group time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London in 2012 the world won the gold prize is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be organised today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time when the officials called him a long time ago.
In the corresponding competition for women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald were standing at 4:13:260.
The Iso-British Group has learned to believe that its powerful wheel crew will take over the Olympics centre and reach the full range of measurements.
When presented in Beijing and London with a truly exceptional and complete management, expectations have been reduced before Rio’s cheeses.
There has been a drama that has been the least of which has been the technical director, Shane Sutton, because of the different sexism and temptation systems in April, as well as the end of the competition between big people, such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competition at the railway station, it appears that the legendary fame of the British is now rising at the top of its peak at a time when it can be expected to take its place again.
The future of the Portland settlement due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium industry, as well as of the hundreds of jobs, is uncertain when an electricity distribution company has discovered that one of the owners is in conclusion of a distribution agreement and is therefore expected to terminate all distribution agreements.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Administration of Victoria not to continue the support required for its operation.
The aid period for 20 years shall end in November.
Even 2000 jobs can be at risk for Alcoan Portland.
Even 2000 jobs may be at risk, either directly or indirectly, through closure.
In addition, the lubricant effect may be possible, as the silica uses about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014 Alcoa closed Point Henry's lockdown, which led to the last year's closure of England's power.
Alcoan Portland's lockdown is going to lose money and is under lockdown.
The measures are now being followed for several years by the future speculatively leading to a strong Australian dollar and have recently been made at the price of production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to the large aluminium industry of Loy Yang An, located in Latrobe Valley, said it is also waiting for three other owners to conclude their agreement.
Most of it is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Maruben Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for Portland to continue its work, which means that the physical power supply of the solution will continue," she said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month expiry date, so they end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the result of contracts to be produced in the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible effects on AGL from 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong market views of electricity support prices.
AGL said it has already reduced the value of the "preliminaries" agreements in the bookstore by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep a balance in operation or to secure a balance of electricity".
The United States company said that it had counted the 20-year contract with Loy Yangin in 2010, and that it had to come into force this year in November, but it had not yet explained why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics have been cautious and in the Portland Valley of Victoria, which is also located near Newcastle because of the possible closure of the area's economic situation.
Last week, AGL's executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts a year and that Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both actions are to be removed from the market, there must be a significant reduction in market demand.
As an electric manufacturer, this wouldn't be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the real-TV of the Kardashian people, is in Vogue in September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is based on the number of the United States Vogues wanted.
Kendall, who is in the brandy of Estee Lauder and who was a model in Milan, Paris and New York, reported news tours on Instagram.
"Looking in this room, which is full of loving people, got me to cry," Kendall wrote.
This was followed by an independent publication (or perhaps only according to the Kardashian style?), a illustrated reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (including the problems Rob and Caitlyn, which was associated with all the best interests, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his visit, but which ended up in a classic translation: they also planned a surprise course.
This is almost every television series of children's "birthday" scene (Seacrest sings "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with a limited amount of credibility), but Kristin had to get his other girls to benefit from this publication.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era from Vogue's place in September.
Kendall's Isososoko Kim may have taken Vogue's position first (she broke it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September is exactly her own class.
The number of birds in September is the most selling weight throughout the year.
Its pressure reminds more of the coffee table than of the form paper, and the number attracts a large number of speakers (Fashion estimates that the last 832-page lesson was mentioned in 615).
Its public disclosure is expected to be so close that the pictures of the newspaper for the last two years have been years before the official publication.
In the past, women have been included in Naomi Campbell, Linda Gospel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has really been more "publics that work as models" than "models that are public".
The Oscar winner and Dior's envoy, Jennifer Lawrence, was named after Lady Gagan in 2013.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, who described his generation as "manipulative", would be part of his first-mentioned category, he's pretty good.
These publications are not the relatives or realists of famous people or today’s young people who are able to do good on the Snapchat video (even Jenner is all of this).
They are basically generous women who succeed in entertainment industry.
The people of Beyoncé have been following the publication of Lemonade for some of its strongest years.
Of course, not everyone is interested in Jenner's success.
In his real-TV history, Jenner's role in the transformation world will always be supported.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, respected Jenner and this colleague Gig Hadidi called them "the worst of this moment".
This feeling rose again on the surface of Jenner's Vogue.
But in the absence of satisfaction, it is inevitable to turn around.
Kendall Jenner's number is based on the number of Vogues.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's gonna sell you Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures to you in their own, paying money in their applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took it to LOVE.
And in free time, just to see the sister of Kourtney and this child, she's a real-TV player.
Community legal centres translate more than 160 000 people per year
More than 160 000 people are affected every year by the Community legal centres when the sector prepares for the effects of the increase in funding on its activities already under way.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight wrong decisions and those who are responsible - are already turned away from their search for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already provided to the beneficiaries of the Community shall be prepared for additional charges.
For the first time in June, these legal centres are to spend 30% of their resources on the financing of the Union.
According to the last National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are now being translated from year to year.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The Community's legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and abusive debt, families in the housing area, job-distributed workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not in need of help.
The Government of the United States will cease funding by 30 per cent in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland have to navigate through multiple legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Ministry of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these financial developments so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
In recent years, the Government of the State has implemented its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average level.
It is now time to examine the needs of the Community legal centre and its clients, and the Palaštuk Government must put this important work in place.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged by law after the employer was charged with a threat
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged by the right that they did nothing after they were told that the head of North Carolina’s activities threatened the workers with guns in February when they arrived at Jeep.
The case was described in the case of Vice-President Vincent Bordeaux's campaign at the Court of Justice of the State in mid-week Charlotte.
Bordeaux said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it shouldn't happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "presented a gun, put his right forward on top of the gun and worked against Vincent's gunpowder," Bord said in his statement.
After being informed of the local and regional campaign management, Bordeaux heard that at least four other persons had had a similar experience with Phillip, who was said to have had the same experience.
"There's no need for weapons to cause damage," Bordí said in his statement.
The challenge will only come two days after the presidential election of the Republicans has given the power to tell the public in North Carolina that "other additional people" - usually referred to as arms owners and arms dealers - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was elected and had to choose judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media had taken his word out of the relationship and that he did not support violence.
In the challenge of Bordeaux, the campaign seeks compensation for the lack of supervision and for violence, ill-treatment and awareness-raising in Philippi.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks did not answer the comment immediately.
The companies that aim at Phillip didn't succeed.
WCCB, the local news company Charlotte reported on the recent campaign from Phillip.
The application for an Innovative Consulting Service to his consulting firm was not answered immediately.
The presidential vice president of the Republic, Donald Trump, has been a controversial campaign.
The Court of Justice of Bordri is against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain has to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings rest and beauty all over the country, not just local communities and different parts of London.
This was the great surprise of Heathrow, just like it was also the surprise of London 2012 when we saw it very difficult to ensure that all our people and our region would benefit from the kisses.
In time, the Olympics benefited greatly from Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
It is feared that local communities will create 10 000 new jobs and 40,000 new jobs and eliminate youth unemployment from the airport.
Like before London in 2012, some will think that the extension of the Heathrow challenge is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for surgery and that we should be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles are always overwhelming, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just for the rare ones.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion green economy, as well as to leave the legacy of art and employment both around the airport and around the United Kingdom.
We have a strong team at Heathrow which has implemented 11 billion red infrastructure programmes during and in the budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal in the last five years, to T2, which was built between the two fastest thanks countries.
The team is now ready to carry out a third thank-you-giver which supports 16 billion pounds of private money.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for the British Isolle, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is also it.
We have time to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a tradition of art and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of State of Finance.
Abblock Plus and Facebook box and mouse game prevention
To companies that receive money from the network, companies end up with statements that prevent the program from being "in-house and hierarchical," said one of the companies that are preparing such a programme.
In Torstana, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent the users from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus would publish a blog post saying that users could update the software's recommendations to prevent the social network from re-examination.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code would be exchanged around the reputations to make it easier for the authors to find out which parts of the page are the reputations.
But now Adblock says it's turned into a new code.
In its blogging paper, the representative of Adblock, Ben Williams, wrote that "probably prior conflict between the Community and its actors opposed the statements of the source code of open war has been on its way since the anti-frauding of these statements was found", and that it is possible that Facebook sought its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much trouble has been brought to industry.
Worldwide, some 200 million users are using the names, reported in the recent year's Pegefair and Adobe research. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1,03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile value now covers 84% of Facebook's popularity.
However, the company is in the wake of computer-based computer-based advertising barriers, as mobile phone users do not operate on Facebook mobile applications for social networking or Instagram, the representative said.
Computers are still making enough revenues to make Facebook view this as an investment value.
Also, on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "majorization" scope to give people more power over how they are addressed.
Torstaina Facebook said that Adblock’s new followers were concerned because they would also stop part of the page other than the mentioned box.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to deal with the problem," said the Facebook representative in an e-mail address.
The speakers of the statements are soft tools that we are focused on building tools such as Ad Choices that give control to people.
A woman left her car under a light motor car, apparently because of suicide
The victim died in the middle of the night on a motorcycle.
The police were looking for viewers after the woman had been on the motorcycle several times under a tortoise in an early hour in case she was apparently suicide.
The event took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight.
The woman did an "inactive act" and was sitting in the dark on the road where she had several walkways, Vaud's police said in their opinion.
A victim who apparently tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old white woman who had several wheelchairs, including a truck.
He died in an accident.
Several of the carriers involved have already been heard, but not all have yet been identified, told the police, who invite them and all the eyewitnesses to report.
The crime investigation has been initiated, which is a "login" step in this situation, Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
"But let's see if any of the drivers get involved in the charge.
Was it possible to avoid confusion?
It's gonna be the prosecutor's solution," Hofstutter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years point out that carriers are not held responsible.
In both cases, in which both persons were walking in a dark motor vehicle, it was estimated that the drivers could not wait to meet their driver on a motorcycle in the middle of the night, it was said in the paper.
In the last year, the police were released from the death penalty resulting from his arrest and execution by a man lying on the road A! near Payinnera one night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim had been murdered and had taken a step in the way, the court was told.
The court found that the police who had been responding to the emergency call started in a reasoned manner, and that the man's location on the road was "indistinct and unpredictable," the judge said.
All persons with information about the worst case near Morges should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA airstrip: Venus had to live once
According to NASA's new climate estimates, Venus was likely to have to live once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Russia using tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether Venus would have hot, waterproofing and air-conditioned fillings of nitrogen and hydrochloric acid could sometimes have been ground conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation speed of Venus explains its pressure to the air.
But last simulation suggests that Venus could have had a dangerous, global climate, and still it could have slowed down.
The model also examined the design of the former Venus surface.
The planet likely had more dryer regions of the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect water from the rapid spread of water.
The progress of ancient Venus was also 30 percent earlier than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals to the sun approximately two months ago," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces a hundred seeds that create a thick cloudy shell that acts as a bridge guard to protect the surface from large sunlight.
As a result, the average air temperature is, in fact, slightly slower than the Earth's present.
The model produced a history of Venus' development, which is similar to what planetary researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to occasionally reside, it was caused by excessive heat and ultraviolet activity over several billion years.
Its powers were destroyed and its waters were turned into ultraviolet radiation.
When I took it away, it was just a heavy carbon dioxide drop into a greenhouse gas mine - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers released the results from the new Venus Aeronautics in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's getting rid of Avalanche's cook's peach.
Patrick Roy resigned from the work of Colorado Avalanche's co-chairman and vice-president, saying that there was no impact on the group's decision-making process.
The Coordinating Director/Chief Joe Sakic confirmed the information and said that the group was starting to search for a new preparer immediately.
"For the last three years, I have been committed to my duties as co-chair of Colorado Avalanchen's ice-cream and head of staff with zeal, enthusiasm and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his opinion.
I have been thinking for a long time and seriously about how I could improve this group so that I can give it the depth it needs and bring it to its higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the Vice-President of the preparatory and wastewater affairs must be fully aligned with the view of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the group’s performance.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who paid Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for this contribution to the group.
"Patric told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we hope that he will be happy in the future.
Roy was appointed the first winner of the Jack Adams Award award to the best producer during Avalanchen from 2013 to 14.
He led the group to 112 points and the middle division to win, but Minnesota fell on the first round of Colorado's football games, and the team has not gone on in the last two years.
Avalanchen games over 2015-16 ended with 39 winnings, 39 losings and 4 winnings, and group lost on the fifth track to Wild lost the card of the West Conference.
Hall of Famee, selected by Roy, won four Stanley Cupia - both in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The oil producers of the North Sea will continue to negotiate and launch the bill
The wage of the oil workers of the North Sea is broken when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading consultants said.
A small oil service company against the Wood Group has been organized successfully under the direction of Royal Dutch Shell on the North Sea coast.
"The Wood Group and the United States and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process which seeks to resolve the current conflict," in a joint opinion, including.
For the next few weeks, we hold several meetings all day, starting early in the first week, so that we can take a fresh look at problems.
According to the employment associations, their recent work-related activity, which they say was the first over 25 years, was in response to the possibility of 30 per cent of wage losses.
This year, the Wood Group dropped the wages of North Sea bankers by about 9 per cent because of the negative market pressure.
The company’s wage reduction is followed by a 10 per cent reduction in the country’s pensioners from 2014 onwards.
The company said that additional distortions would provide the company with the necessary means of transport to cope with the calculation of the markets in question.
On behalf of the Shell, thousands of people have been recruited by the payroll and have announced their plans to leave oil and gas activities in 10 countries, while the company is facilitating its activities as a result of its losses with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the lower prices of crude oil and this economic situation will deteriorate Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Mr Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met earlier this week to discuss one of the largest North Sea jobs.
He said that North America is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many and not only for the rare, both in the North Sea and throughout the country," he said in his opinion.
The North Sea is expected in 2016 to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects, while the average value of the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Plejades Star
The last task of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped star manufacturers to collect a more complete list of star rotations for the Plejade Star Group.
New data will help star manufacturers to understand why star group stars rotate at different speeds and how planets are connected to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star groups, we will now learn more about the mass, age, and even the history of the solar community," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Centre for Caltech's Infrassion and Analysis of Pasadena in the press release
The Plejaden star team is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching maturity.
They're on their way now.
As they speed up their adult stars, they will consume a large amount of time.
When these winds travel along the path of the stars, they follow the stars.
When the star gets older, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by following the signs of stars, such as the rays of the sun.
The recent list of rotation speeds indicates that more massive stars are rotating later than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers whose fathers make drawings slower than smaller ones.
"In "the game" we see that slow bikers are usually more massive, while faster drivers are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since Plejaden's star group is so close, it's a wonderful space laboratory to evaluate the properties of stars at rotation speeds.
"The star group of the Playadays offers a weak star turnout to theoretical models that deal with both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotation speed and so say they depend on their 'flying' song.
Rebull and his colleague described their last analysis of the speed of rotation of Plejaden in three articles published in the Astromical Journal soon.
