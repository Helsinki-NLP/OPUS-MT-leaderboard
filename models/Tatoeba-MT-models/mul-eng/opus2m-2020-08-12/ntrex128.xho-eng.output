The members of the Wales convention (AMs) are concerned about our personal appearance
There are Ams concerned because they are raised to change their so-called MWPs (Wals Parliamentary Member).
This has been highlighted because there are plans to change the name of the convention to the Parliament of Wales.
Ams in politics are concerned that this will bring them together.
Another AM of Labor says his group is concerned that the so-called new name is close to the so-called "Twp" and "Pwp."
To a non - Witness reader in Wales: Welsh utwp speaks a wall while upwp speaks a word.
AAM of Wales says that the whole organization doesn't like this, and recommends it in other words.
A Conservative member of Wales also claims that his group is not in trouble with the change of name, but has found it easy to call MWP as he calls the wall.
In this case, how y is called Welsh is the same as how y is called y is in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is interested in breaking the law to change the name and this new one, says: "The decision to call the members of the Convention will be taken by their own members."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Wales convention permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of human responses and found that many supported the fact that the convention changed the name of the Parliament of Wales.
On the way to call the AMs, the Commission likes the Members of the Wales Parliament or the WMPs, but people also support the MWP.
II-AMS is said to be recommended in another way, but the fact that it's difficult to deal with this matter must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Chief Agent, who is expected to adopt the law by a change in the next few weeks.
This change law will also include other matters that will be changed as part of the convention, including the rules to suspend the Ams and how the committee is formed.
Ams votes will finally be counted when this law is discussed on the question of what they are called.
Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The voters will vote on Sunday even if they change their country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The vote was taken to resolve the decades - long struggle between the Greek Orthodox neighboring country called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long been claiming that the name of their neighbours in the north has made us vulnerable to their territory, and have long opposed their request to be EU and NATO members.
Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, who had voted in favour of the change of name, said that he would not vote for him.
However, people who support this vote, including President Zoran Zaev, say this change in name is a value they need to fight to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's ships are not used as hard as the hankers of the Harlem
Mr. Adams says, "The elders who have spoken with me have said that there has been a barrier and a church in every place."
"Today, none of them."
You understand why the barriers are suddenly gone.
He says, "People enjoy it another way" in these days.
"It's not where people live."
He is concerned about the churches because he thinks that the money he earned by selling his goods will not last as long as the leaders always think, "and soon they will return to their former circumstances."
In addition, churches can be replaced by posters that will never help to keep the remaining holy places.
He said, "Many people don't buy these tickets for white people. Therefore it will be early in the day when the churches will be closed, for they don't seem to be the ones who move to these churches."
The two churches were congregations of white people before the Harlem became a place of black people, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The first white congregation in Wales came out in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation neared that location was built.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the death sentence. John Howard Johnson, who was leading the 125th Street shopping theater, the main street in Harlem, opposed the lack of employment and support from black people.
In 1939 this building was severely damaged by fire, but as Father’s parliaments were preparing to rebuild, they were ordered to be beaten with rods.
Death. David Johnson, his son and he entered Father's bones in St. Martin's, calling it "the bones of the afflicted people."
A man who had been armed with iron and steel, he called himself "the art of art" and "the instrument of history that will never take place."
This song, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also said that this instrument was the first time in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church with many bicycles over the past 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's has put someone in his place.
The first thing they did here in St. Martin's last few months was a bunch of planners and architects, some of whom were set up by non-religious church leaders, others by the rabbinic church.
The governing body, composed of non - clergy leaders of the slave class in July, ensures that the slave is free to charge the congregation, although he has not been involved in the training of planners and shipbuilders sent by the slave.
Some parliaments complain that the slave does not remember things.
A 13-year-old child who is forced to get a lot of lobbysters in California
The officials said, the raid hit and destroyed a 13-year-old boy by the end, when they were taken to catch a logster in California on the day when it was opened for the year to launch the lobby.
This attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel tells KSWB-TV in San Diego that she's been in bed with friends for half an hour at the end of the day when the boy heard a cry for help. They asked her to come and help him get out of the water.
Hammel says, at first I thought it was a pleasure to hold the lobby, but then "he realized that it was a joke, 'I'm sorry!'
'I'm sorry!'
The passage is under the top of the head and above the neck," Hammel says, "I'm aware of this when this child comes.
"I was hoping that everyone would get out of the water, saying, 'There's a hole in the water!'" He added, "Hammel.
The boy is driven by a car to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a state of emergency.
It is not known what kind of plague this attacker is.
The sea rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said when he spoke to the news, his skull was seen there last week, but it was said to be not a dangerous form of cancer.
Gilles added that this victim was suddenly injured in this upper body.
The officers closed the sea from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to be released for security and security.
Giles says there are more than 135 types of crocodiles in this area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
Sainsbury's suggests that its products be placed in the UK's advertising brand
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams because they have a habit of being friendly and intelligent enough to help people.
As an important way to get into the UK's credit market that makes £2.8bn, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, these large-scale passports will be tested at 11 shops throughout the country, and will be available at more than one year to carry on well.
The charge of money on bills is available because these stores want to use empty phones after charge of TV, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will increase its production twice as many as 3,000 times, including today's names by Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw first.
They already have L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have a lot of space to put in areas like those to find themselves in stores like Boots.
The shop will reassess the Boutique repair products so that many people do not eat meat - something that is strongly needed by young buyers.
For one thing, the salesman of luxury goods the Florence Shop will test the needs of two Saninsbury's shops, first opened in Croydon, south of London, this weekend and second opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, during the year.
Buying on the Internet and now that people buy less daily food in nearby shops, this means that big shops do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, head manager of the Saninsbury's, says, these shops will appear to be large factories with different productions, as they try to fight companies with values such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and other non-food items.
Sainsbury's puts where Argos can be bought in many shops and started with the Habits because it bought two of them two years ago. That's why they bought food and bought themselves.
The efforts of this former factory to improve the supply and medical offices have been under way.
His Sansbury's tried to meet Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke up after the fight to share medical inputs in their shops.
This new trend is after the Sainsbury's sold Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's drug business 281 by £125m, over the past three years.
Lloyds also will participate in this project, by increasing the high-level errors of La Roche-Posay and Vicky in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Saninsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance of passports with our trailers to improve our customers.
We have paid special attention to trained people so that they can make suggestions.
The various products we have are made ready for each demand, making it easier for a person to find a place where it is easy to find, now it's a place of entertainment that is interesting and that's not the same as the old way of buying."
Peter Jones' voice because Holly Willoughby has a £11 million business
Peter Jones, a member of the Dragons Den, went "with anger" after the director Holly Willoughby gave up £11 million in the production of life-cycles to make sure that he was fully in line with their new agreements with Marks and Spencer and with TV
Willoughby does not have time for their production of household goods and supplies like Truly.
The business of these two is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
This is the 37-year-old This Morning running system, which is installed on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left her standing at Dragons" Den, Peter Jones was angry because she came out in the last minute of the production business of life--to get her new connections with Marks & Spencer and TV.
Sources say Jones has been "voice" when an important girl on TV agrees at a hot meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements - reaching £1.5 million - do not have enough time to stop the production of household goods and supplies like Truly.
The company is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop production and has received twice Willoughby's worth of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37 years old, put into Instagram to leave Truly, Jones himself died to one of his home in Britain.
The source says: "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
It would be his long - term appointment for the next ten years.
The decision to leave him is a personal one.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, near the funeral.
There's a store full of stuff in Marlow HQ ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's teacher, one of those who have large revenue in Britain, can feed the company with millions of dollars because of the high cost of production from rooms and roads to goods and household goods, as well as other things that can be of greater importance to its establishment.
And this can mean the end of a long relationship.
The three Willoughby’s mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
[Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as a leader in Marchi.
These two go together at the holiday and Jones has 40 percent of the assignment in Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby will be the founder of this M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity TV driver.
A source near Jones has said "We can't talk about his business business."
We talked about 'and we loved each other'
He is proud of the criticism that he often received from the media by saying what others consider to be "no glory" and by speaking well of North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump recommend such things?
Trump said in his exposé of "the teacher in the program."
"I don't think of anything."
He noted that Kim was interested to reunite after the first encounter in Singapore in June that had been held by the trumpeter on Trump as a major step toward nuclear end in North Korea.
But the nuclear war has ended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s High Commissioner Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations about the UN High Court’s decision that the North does not see "the same answer" from the United States to North Korea with arms-free movement.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its own focused pressure.
Trump has hoped in the talk he gave at his party.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were fought by North Korea.
I have not been killed by millions of people.
Now we're very close."
He says his efforts to improve communication with Kim and the fine fruitage of the prison trial, which led to the release of persecuted people and the return of American soldiers.
And he has protected them from his unusual speech about Kim.
"It's easier to be the president, than there are 10,000 outsiders who try to get into this whole game and there may be about 200 people standing here," the Trump said to a group standing right in front of him.
Indonesia and Nykima, destroying the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they did not need it.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's residents have been removed from the area, that place has not been declared a disaster, which will cause global aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for help from the world, so this is a challenge," Nkszn Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children include a group to go to Palu, they are not sure if local workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a national secretary of disaster management, said that Indonesian officials were investigating the situation in Palu to see if the world’s institutions would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the global movement that has always reached Indonesia, this country is not always prepared in a surprising way for the earthquake.
While hiding areas of tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are safe from other oceans.
The absence of a tsunami warning system in Palu, although it has increased, may have contributed to the death of people.
Even during the turbulent times, the visit between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel even more difficult.
A hospital ship living in Lombok to take the victims to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it arrives at this disaster site.
President Joko Widododo put it first to improve the growing development bases in Indonesia when he was in charge of relief aid, and he has spent a lot of money on improving roads and medical care.
But the lack of financial support has led to Mr. Government. The game will be re-elected next year.
Mr. Joko, however, is faced with the pressure of a complex conflict in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have entered the service center.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fight in the streets using knives, knives, and knives, as well as other dangerous weapons.

Artist Brian O'Hagan says: 'The research begins but I urge anyone in the John Street area in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything that does not concern us.
But I would have you know, that the nobles, and the rulers of the synagogue, were willing to make a petition to any man concerning anything that they might ask of us, as long as it has been commanded you.
The police speaker made sure that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found inside the property.
Relatives who think they know this woman came to this place and asked questions about where she was found this morning.

The last photograph of Cromwell was found by a “rewritement of history” group
Their removal will be a figurative justice because of his similar destruction of the Taliban in the most numerous images of nature and religion carried out by his zealous Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Mr. Crick's advice "as stupid" "and trying to re-write history."
[A] John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was unlikely that in this conversation there would be any mention of the removal of images cut off that Oliver Cromwell's carved image outside the Palace of Westminster would become a victim.
The destruction of images taken in English wars was not commanded or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be awarded for his actions by his grandfather Thomas of the first century.
The way Lady William Hamo Thorneycroft describes Cromwell is a 19th - century commentary and part of the history of many who no longer believe that his life should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps the majority of cases at the end of the 19th century than at present, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, the majority of cases in his case are the pressure from the empire.
Whether this way of explaining it is completely dependent on ongoing historical debate.
The fact is that the group that existed in the middle of the 17th century has been responsible for the development of our next country, and Cromwell is the one who has counted himself as one side of the group.
And they shall keep the feast of unleavened bread, and shall remember it.
The Deadly Hagu Attacked China’s Farmer Killed
A farmer has been attacked by a hagu on the southwestern border of China, according to local reports.
A man, described only by his "Yuan," was found a disabled man with a broken bone, bleeding near the Liupanshui graveyard in the Guizhou province, South China Morning Post made that report on Sunday.
A Hagu farmer prepares to harvest his haugas in an aago on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Hong Kong, China.
It is said that he was taking his parents from a nearby corner of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 haugs in the marketplace.
The next morning, his parents found him missing, and he found that the door to the nearby cabin was open.
He says that there was a large blood clot in the mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the hagu pregnancy was a 550 mark that damaged the mother, according to the report.
"The mother's legs were blood and bloody," said the mother always called her name "Wu," as quoted by Guyan Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan entering this mark at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed the caves.
His body was found about an hour later.
The goad did not kill Yuan’s own brother or relative.
The Marquee manager told Evaning News that the bridge was closed so as not to attack other people, while the police gathered evidence at the site.
Yuan’s family and wealthy authorities are said to have argued about his absence.
While it is unlikely, conditions in which caves have been recorded when people have been attacked earlier.
In 2016, the Hagu attacked a miner and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, a man who had been badly injured.
Over the past ten years, a heavy 650 hagu caught the Welsh farm in the trechthari until his wife took it off.
After an Oregon farm was eaten by its haugas in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that the haugas did not hesitate to be greedy but their blood flow could cause them to do so.
In time, they simply play.
They're gifts, they're too expensive... they don't have a purpose to harm you.
You have to give yourself the right amount of money," you say.
The Hurricane Rosafragms bring global flooding to the southwestern U.S.

More than 20 million people had witnessed the Chinese movement of a Supreme Court election by Brett Kavanaugh and a Chinese spy by using violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
According to this moment, the political situation continues, with a message that disturbs the structure of the fifth ordinary procedure to change it in the last minute: the agreement made by Sen of Arizona by Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the trial of the case.
Ford tells the Senate Board that he is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh put his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him of his clothes from high school fees.
Kavanaugh, a physical evidence, says you're 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It is common that they were more than 20.4 million people who had seen Nelson's report on the Pacific.

And you have the right to balance those who have visited the offices.
If this is the case, the same number of followers will be observed when the finals are seen directly on the main stage of the course or at the Education Courses.
The Fox news channel, in its view, has a strong support system for Kavanaugh, leading all other networks through 5.69 million followers during the day-to-day trial, says Nielsen.
ABC was in second place by 3.26 million spectators.
CBS is 3.1 million, NBC is -2.94 million, MSNBC is -2.89 million and CNN is -2.52 million, according to Nielsen.

"I am standing here before you," said the man who had the withered hand.
"Do you think you're telling the truth in the world?
He was told, "You are strong, but most of the spies are weak."
Flake says his office issued a statement and said that before closing the clothing, there was more to the counsel committee.
the media networks and cables were all spreading at that moment in the next hour, while the Governing Committee would vote to continue the launch of Kavanaugh in the full voting capacity.
But Flake says that he will do so only through the FBI where he will have to look at the charges against the election that week, where a few groups of Democrats were proposed.
Fleke recommends that he talk to his friend, I'm a senator of the Democrats Chris Coos.
After speaking with Cons and other senators thereafter, Flake has made a decision.
Flake’s choice is stronger, for there is evidence that the Republicans do not vote to accept Kavanah without having been investigated.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation to appeal to the charges placed by Kavanaugh.

Pro-independence groups have launched a Friday night to stop focusing on supporting national police.
Spectators have continued but have been forced to do so by other means.
Narcis Termes, 68, a mechanic has been involved with ethnic and cultural prejudices and his wife has no hope that the Catalans can gain freedom.
"In the last year we had another pleasure that we enjoyed.
I have visited my parents with tears of joy because they could not vote, but can't continue now," she says.
In addition to the lack of detailed control over the settlement of the islands last December, the Catalan pro-independence groups have begun to maintain the situation this year because their most well-known leaders have kept themselves in custody or under police custody waiting for the prosecution to be discussed because of the role they played in calling the referendum and following the successful sale of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old high-ranking engineer with police support on his phone, says the conference has been influenced by politicians on both sides.
"There's more and more fear."
In conclusion, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans in the pre-trial debate at the end of last year, invites you to take part in the European Parliament's reform this coming year.
"If there is to be a choice in Europe's reform, it is the best way to condemn free conduct and government that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Mr. Livingston's article 1-0 said he was successful in the Rangers
The first article of Dolly Go to Livingston
Livingston's promotion will surprise the Rangers by filling Steven Gerrad with only twice in the 18th game if the Ibrox club manager is made.
The attacker, Dolly Menga, has confirmed the difference as Gary Holt's case increases the level with the Hebrew in seconds.
Gerrrard's case has already been unsuccessful in the Premiership games this season and is facing Hearts leaders, who run eight articles, in this Cawe there.
Earlier, the French had met Rapid Vienna in the European League of China.
Livingston, now, has reported their level of driving in this section to six games, where the Chief Trainer Holt is about to finish the race when he entered Kenny Miller's place this month.
Livingston has missed opportunities for illegal visitors
Holt’s team should have been leading before the articles were put in place, directly by its approach that caused the Rangers to have all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson has insisted that he withdraw your efforts from the article, Alan Lithgow may mention his efforts directly after the entry
Hosts were happy to see the Rangers playing before them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests they loved.
And that is how we come to have an important article.
The Rangers have accepted free kick and Livingston has been active and open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have joined by setting Menga, which has inspired the ball to insert an article from the middle of the box.
At the same time, the Rangers were the most able to catch the ball but found that the attack was strong and that Liam Kelly had no problem.
The behavior has continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced him to close a ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman has heard of Allan McGregor’s role as a Ranger and Lithgow who threw a ball from another player in Livingstone.
The broken letters have continued to come to the Livingston box and continue to be explained, while you have two pints after Halkett's strike without Glen Middleton's place, one was handball-backed up here.
"Amazement" from Livingston-based
Scotland's BBC in Alaska Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
Playing at a wonderful level and the results of Livingstone.
To the man. They were outstanding, and they continued to highlight everything that was expected in this way that was sent ahead.
Their way of play and control not only changes when they get back on a regular plane, but Holt is given the credit for the team’s success.
He had many relatives.
The leader of the group Halkett had his own, including the superbly-subscribed defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral from the animals at all times.
The Rangers needed trouble.
Although they played very well for some time under Gerard, they have fallen prey to these tactics.
Their last ball was probably where they had sold their homeside open and it was something that woke up in the Rangers camps, which they had found in the middle of the table.
Erdogen received mixed reception in Coligne
It was full of mud and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) as Turkish and German leaders gathered together in Berlin for a meal in the future.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's visit that can be opposed to Germany's nuclear power to repair the link between NATO's associations.

Hurricane Rosa disturbs Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by flooding water up the sky (Flying areas can be flooded]
It is unlikely that tropical stress struck Arizona, but it can occur right at the beginning of that week as Hurricane Rosa has the ability to travel in the Southeast Forest, exposing the dangers of high - water floods.
The Service of the Universe has already provided flood control equipment for the Flood and the Second in western Arizona and eastern Nevada, in western California and Utah, including the following cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take her straight path to Phoenix on Tuesday, which caused the rains of the Flood.
The General Weather Service in Phoenix wrote that only on tweets "10 is the tropical cyclones stored in a tropical storm or at the pressure level in 200 miles in Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is not a hurricane within 40 miles of AZ. "
The recent model of the National Hurricane National Park covers the rain in two to four inches, and we will have to travel alone to 6 inches in Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
In some parts of the South-West Forest include the centre of Rockies and Great Basin, they may find the 1st to 2nd century, and travel alone to the 4th century if there is any.
In these dangers of Rosa’s rainwater floods, it is a blessing to see the storm hit by lightning.
Although water travel is of utmost importance, some rains have been turned off because the South has a problem of flooding at the same time.
According to the U.S. The survey of the case, more than 40 percent of Arizona's minority have a major problem with the case, which is the second level at the highest level",weather.com did.
First, the way Hurricane Rosa leads to the fertile land of Baja in California, the island of Mexico
Rosa, which continues with energy from Cawe tomorrow at 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and travels up and down by 12 miles per hour.
A mine has been found in the Pacific waters, and it is still a good source of energy.
Nevertheless, it is expected that we will make a fall in Mexico in the tropical power of a hurricane after the Flood.
The heavy rain on Mexico’s beaches is affecting the proper risk of water travel.
"The rain level is 3 to 6 seconds to be expected from Baja and California to the top of the west of Sonora, up to 10 seconds possible", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north to Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving on the Arizona board at two o’clock in the morning as a tropical pressure, which will then lead us up to Arizona and to the bottom of Utah on the Black Sea at night.
"The most dangerous future for Rosa or farms is the great rain in Baja in California, in northern Sanora, and in the US. The South-West Forest," the National Heritage says
These rains are expected to produce terrible rains as well as the vegetation of the forest rivers, lakes on mountainous land.

Hundreds of Indians were killed by an earthquake, a tsunami that appears to have a growing tide
At least 384 people were killed, many were burned to the depths of the sea, where a great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Indonesia in Sulawesi, where the authorities finally spoke.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu Sea windows on the fifth floor, where over six feet (18 feet) high lay on the dry ground, which killed many people and destroyed them on their way.
Itssunami is followed by the magnitude of a 7.5-threshold.
"As a tsunami promises peace, people would do their jobs at sea and would not leave immediately and eventually be victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian public service spokesman, said the BNPB when he gave changes to Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not travel alone, driving cars, bridges, houses, leaving everything on earth," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami walked at an open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before it reached the sea.
Some people carry trees because they try to escape from the tsunami and save themselves, as it were.
About 6,700 people have been expelled from their homes to 24 Palu homes.
The Aerial photographs produced by an Argentinian service exhibit a number of buildings and shops destroyed by tsunamis, floods and floods.
The tsunami’s fruitage has continued to move the city’s coast by the end.
An estimated 2.4 million people are affected by the earthquake.
The Indonesian Institute of Technology Tests (BPPT) said in its speech that there was a very high level of force at 200 times when compared to the nuclear explosive sent to Hiroshima at the Second World War.
National science in the City, which lasts at the end of the period, the closure of the roof, can increase the size of the tire, the speech.
Unugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shop rooms and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of other victims are trapped under the wall of broken buildings, and it adds that 540 people are injured and 29 are invisible.
Nugroho says victims and damages are as high as 300 kilometres (190 miles) in the North of Palu, in what is called Donggara, and is the shortest in the epicenter of the earthquake.
The contact "expressed completely" from Dongala, and Nugroho's speech.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in their speech, adding that their employees and volunteers would take them to the affected areas.
"It's a disaster already, but it can be more," he said.
Jarrente was generally criticized for being attacked by Palu's tsunami, although officials have come to the scene at the time of the warning.
The pictures of people who are still learning how to dress have been shared on the lines of communication where a man is more than a hearer at the building’s hearing level warning of despair when the tsunami reaches people and the streets below.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the coast and took buildings and cars deep into it.
Reuters could not move the image immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive explosion of electricity that caused the explosion in the Palu area and made it difficult for them to carry out their rescue efforts.
The troops began sending cargo vehicles and aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities, but those who had left their homes needed much more food and other necessities and necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widododo arranged for a visit to the homes of people who had been left behind by the church in Palu.
The Toll Soars of Tsunami Indonesia are over 800.
Some of them are Khuhu.
While the World Vision workers in Donegal arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers were settled in areas where they were prepared to live in their offices in Tarpaulin, they passed through the events of concern in their area, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me to see a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
Very bad
And as a relief team that begins to express the violent feelings of starting disaster relief, some complain that foreign relief workers have been denied access to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian principles, financial support, support and employment for workers from overseas can only begin to travel if the flag flag is added as a place of disaster.
That's not possible for me.
"It's a disaster at the London level," says Aulia Ariani, a Red Cross speaker in Indonesia.
"The speaker once said, "Oh, God, this is a disaster of the country," we could open it up to the whole world but we wouldn't be at all right now."
As the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami, relatives and relatives were still not visible, hoping that relatives and relatives would come and leave this miracle behind a sad story about the natural disasters.

Mexico's AMLO promised he wouldn't use the armies to live
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use life-threatening security forces as the country has reached the 50th anniversary of the loss and non-refoulement of students.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never use the forces to force the people of Mexico."

U.S. is again supported by A.I.
China has been more committed to the inconsistencies, the U.S. needs to spend more time in the research department, saying financial support and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who are working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments will come after different sections of the U.S. government make AI's ads, as well as U.S. based on all legal ways of AI.
At the present time, China announced its plan in the last year: it was focused on the 2030 AI.
"The repeat of the AI research budget will be an appropriate start, as all other countries back to the U.S., and we look at the next AI," said Lee.
Repeating financial support can double the chances of the next major success of AI to be made in the U.S., said Lee in a conference with the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Great Powers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Innovation Ventures, supported by one of the largest AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon who was working at the AI program, Othello player in America, who was later director of Microsoft Love, and was president of Google at the China branch.
Lee has accepted the past U.S. government technology competition as the R & D R Project Challenge and has wondered when there will be a next time, so as to select the following ideas.
U.S. researchers need to work hard to get government support, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes educational leaders; it's a united group," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies hire university professionals to work for AI in recent years.
Lee says that the change in foreign travel policy can help support its AI efforts
"I think a green card will be given automatically to those who make PhD's in AI," he said.
The National Council of China issued its Ninth-Nyhan National Dissemination Plan for the Follow-up Generation in July 2017.
The China Foundation of the Universe of Science provides funding for learning from students of the same educational sciences as it does the Science and other government institutions that offer money to U.S. researchers, but it is below the level of education in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Security Department established the Non-Discrimination Advisory Committee, which was organized into working groups from production to education, and White House announced the establishment of the Committee of Innocent Guidance Committee.
And this month the DARPA announced $2 billion savings as the start of a trial called AI in the Next.
As NSF, it now accounts for over $100 billion a year and has been prepared for research in AI.
At the present time, the U.S. law is determined to establish a National Security Commission for the Non-Neighbourish Council in recent months.
The Macedonians voted in the referendum to change their country’s name.
The Macedonians voted in the referendum on Cawe to change the name of the country to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia," a movement that has solved the long-standing conflict for ten years with members who have called values in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, wants to be close to its northern neighbours and close the door to NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement on June on the basis of a new petition, but the Nationalists' opponents object to the change in the name they claim to undermine the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonian's Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote for the irferendum and the campaign to work together was not sure that voters could meet the requirements to include a 50-percent reduction required to implement a valid referendum.
The question in the referendum vote is read as follows: "Can you be a NATO member and this EU who accepts the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that the payment price is appropriate for approval on such boards as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of which will meet at the end of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, I am making new people here in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that will mean a secure life for all of us," says Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although there is no legal error, members of the parliament state that they will be bound by the results of the vote to make it appropriate.]
The change in the name will require a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
The country's reporting commission did not contain unusual reports of 1 p.m.
However, people in attendance stood at 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary review where 66 per cent voted.
"Here I will vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, and will vote in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name that will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, repaired a small cane and moved it to the front of the halls set up by those who opposed the referendum.
"We don't have NATO and the EU, but we want to join freely, not by door services," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not like Macedonia, we can turn such countries as China and Russia into part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says the NATO membership will bring us the most needed funds in Macedonia, where unemployment rates are more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like you because more than 80 percent of Nato's and EU's people will love you," Zaeveva said in writing.
The word "yes" will be the result "to guarantee our future."
The list of votes will be printed by the latest Macedonian Police Report of the Poundo which is held between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of the votes that will take part in the referendum here below the number required for the vote to be successful.
Another list of voters, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, has been found in 57 percent of the people who have arranged to vote on Cawe.
Today, 70 percent would vote for them.
For the referendum to succeed, 50 percent of people and more than one person must vote.
The failure of the referendum will lead to the first strong appeal to the pro-Western government police since their takeover in May last year.

Scherzer wants to play when playing Spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals filter is conducted in a playoff conference, there is no reason why we force it to be restarted.
But Sherzer, who was always at odds with the hope of finding a comfortable place in Cawe when he was playing with Colorado Rockies, but only when the results were recorded in Rockies' pylaffes, and had a lead to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West of NL.
The Rockies completed at least a wild-card spot where they won 5-2 in the Nationals on Friday night, but they looked at their patrol in the first section.

Irish of Trump in West Virginia
The President is not directly referring to the situation surrounding a person elected in the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh when he speaks of the importance of the issue of the Republicans to vote in a midterm election.
"All we've done can be lost in November.
The remaining five weeks before history’s restoration is especially important in our time.
This is great, great—I don't run away and I don't run away from this thing I'm full of everywhere I'm struggling to find people who'll represent the right people," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You saw the bad things, the bad things of a group that are violent against the Democrats, you saw them happening right now.
And he is determined to take control of them by using any means he feels fit, corrupt, insensitive.
For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, to him will be taken away even that which he has."
Democrats, he says, on the mission are on a mission to "to oppose and disrupt."
"And you've seen what happened in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "because they are angry with corruption and lack of compassion and injustice."
He referred to the Senate Control Committee at the level of St. Stephen Feinstein by his name, even when he received information from viewers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you submitted the document?
Uh, uh, yinton.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one -- it's bad talking about the body-- talking about the body the most bad way I've ever seen."
Labour will no longer be destroyed.
Do not be impatient with what others are saying
While Momentum's activists in my local group voted against me, she became a woman.
After all that, I'm the first on the lab's MPs list to be told that they don't want everyone to talk about it.
A fellow worker with me in the parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar prize from me and then stood up confidently against the Jews.
In my case, the situation of my criticism and opposition was not consistent with Jeremy Corbyn.
In an important policy of the current economic system, national security, in Europe, followed by similar cases where Jeremy disagrees with former leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour report of the Ffulu-based Meeting states that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and have good results."
Almost all these eight years I'm a Labour MP at home, the night's GC meetings on the Fridays were exactly the same.
Where bad is it today, this meeting today is not a shadow of a meeting that has often had "humanity and flesh, under" of politics that has disappeared, but can begin again.
It appears that there is a growing difference of views that are not accepted by the Working Group and that the whole opinion is being examined before being accepted by the Group.
This begins after Jeremy's entry into the board of directors, as a person who worked with me and I had the idea of sharing with him a similar view of politics and the prospect of returning it quickly and taking places I didn't agree with - whether it was national or trade protection or one of the EU.
I've always spoken out -- and what I don't care about has been followed by abuse on the dialogue pages is said to be removed from the seat, there's no policy of the state, I'm told I don't deserve to be in the lab.
And that’s what I feel.
Thus, I know that I am more modest than others at work, as the comments I receive are directly supported by those who like to be political.
I respect the art and the determination of my fellow workers who face sexual or racial torture every day but who have no way out of it.
One of the most disturbing things in this political environment is the way the levels of violence are and still tend to be common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Working Group took up the art of endurance.
The truth is that we are no longer big and because of "untrusted" or changing the rules of a group of secretaries.
I've got a lot of money over the past two years asking me to leave, not to talk about it like this and then "it's all right."
But this is not what I will do with politics.
That's what I said when I joined Labour in the 32nd year as a school student, the government of Thatcher doesn't care if I don't miss the room I've been reading from, since then I swore I'd fight for the best human services and their needs, especially if I was rich or the government's manager.
I hid my involvement in politics, including this past reform.
No one in the East of Nottingham can escape any way about where I am from my police, and where I do not agree with the current leaders.
In these situations now advanced in the fifth century, I can say to all of us that when Brexit is under pressure to damage our homes, businesses and services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy in my trust with the manager of the lab.
The most important thing is that one message I have is not going to Nottingham Momentum, you go to my people, whether they are members of the Labor or not: I am proud of working under you and I promise that there is no value to being left out of fear or political help that can prevent me from doing what I believe are your needs better than all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Air is moving forward
The two latter events tend to last almost directly lead to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this good opportunity to celebrate the day of the Tennt's Premiership.
Now it is growing, the most widely divided.
Finally, it was their high - ranking protection, their hunger and opportunity to take a better opportunity, which resulted in the execution of the family’s guilt along with the trainer Peter Murchie.
"We've been tested in our games until now, and we're not even touched, so I should be happy," he said.
Robin Christie said to Melrose: "To commend Ayr, do better than we did."
Grant Anderson in his trip to 14 minutes, changed by Frasier Climo, and put Ayr ahead of him, but, the Scottish Cap's yellow card, Rory Hughes, was copied by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make his own list and Jason Baggot took no changes.
Climo has taken over Ayr's leadership with penalty, before, for half the time of the game, has put an article after changing the solotry to Ayr 17-5 during the rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's tract, translated by Baggot, reduced the opportunity for five articles.
It has been said that for a long time because of the extreme damage done by Rudolf Knott, who was expelled from the streets, Ayr has been on the move with the help of Stafford McDowell, translated by Climo.
Ayr’s master - in - law Blair Macpherson has been awarded a credit card, and once again, Melrose has paid another man for Bruce Colvine’s translation of the tract, under severe pressure.
However, it is returned home and when Struan Hutchinson was given a credit card because of creating Climo without a ball outside the pentalline, MacPherson has gone back to sleep as he was shot by Ayr.
Climo has translated, as has almost since its reopening, after Kyle Rowe has included David Armstrong’s letters in the box and sent the bottle to Gregor Henry for a long time by inserting a fifth line.
The Styl Game puzzle looks like a new team in the classroom
The Still Game poet Ford Kieran seems to be determined in the guest reception section after it has been found to have been appointed as director of a licensed school company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which also writes another novel that starts with Greg Hemphil.
The two have already explained that the next nine will be the last in the course of the show and that Kiernan is evidently preparing to do something else after Craiglang.
According to the list of legal reports, he is the ruler of the Apionmorn Limited.
The player has not wanted to comment on this article, although the Scottish Sun source has said that Kiernan wants to enter "the best school business" in Glasgow.
'Wet Sea': Bolivia's closed in the world hope that the road will open its way to the Pacific
Shipyards have always been the main cargo in La Paz.
The public buildings protect the blue flag from the sky.
The maritime military systems from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bona fide with the words: "Our sea is legally ours.
To get it back from our job."
Throughout Bolivia, the memories of the sea of Chile in the 19th century's war on wealth have still remained in mind - as well as the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been the highest in the centuries, as Bolivia is awaiting a world court judgment on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and peace, and we expect a good spirit of results," said Roberto Calzadilla, an expert in Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will listen to the Supreme Court’s judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on the Bolivian issue of ten years later and again in Chile to consider Bolivia’s large entrance to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s president and cousin - in - law, faced a heavy debt that was rebuffed in the coming year, has much to do with this judgment of the Supreme Court.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he confirms with a statement at the end of August.
But some commentators believe that it is not possible for a court to judge the case on the Bolivian side of the account to change it so much.
The United Nations Commission in the Netherlands has the power to expel Chile’s land, and it is said that it does not know the results of any possible speech.
The fact that the trial of the World Law Court is only six months after it was discussed shows that the case is "unconstitutional," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean lawyer.
And instead of being in conflict with Bolivia’s desires, four years may well have gone back.
"The port of sea access has been closed by the existing government of Bolivia," Zarate said.
Morales ’ words of fighting have ended any kind of kindness that Chile has ever experienced.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be very difficult to talk after this.
These two countries have not been in contact with the future since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, has been responsible for the sudden decision of the court.
The Rain will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to discover on a new page of cooperation with Chile" and "to end 139 years of non-conformity without benefits," he says.
Calzadilla quotes the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses the sea as a political pillar.
"Bolivia won't just give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," she said.
"This is an opportunity to see if we're going to have to bring things back."
North Korea says it will no longer abandon nuclear weapons until it can be trusted by the United States
North Korea’s Research Director Ri Yong Ho says that his country will no longer be separated from its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
I was talking about the outcome of the United Nations Legal House.
He asks the United States to follow the promises made during the Singapore convention among the leaders facing the blind.
He says these words when National Council Mike Pompeo appears to have begun a nuclear war more than three months after Singapore and Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says "it's nine days" because the United States itself is the beginning of the Korean War until the North is giving up.
Washington warns us to accept this agreement before Pyongyang takes steps to break these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump were looking for a second convention.
But many people doubt Pyongyang’s willingness to praise the world’s weapons as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang this month to prepare for Kim’s convention with Trump.
Paris’s fashion exhibitions depict a variety of recent events that will be seen on city streets near you
If you want to increase the amount of energy you have or if you want to take the sun away, we will go somewhere else.
Artists Valentino and Thom Browne have begun to make a series of the most unusual scenes of SS19 showings that are next to the level set at the Paris Fashion Week.
These shocking reports have moved to Instagram in this way and these readers have sent their surprise reports to the scene.
Valentino’s sole traveling merchant with a driver’s belt is toss the whole head of the cargo.
Some large jars that are too large include cassavats, even a pianist, but they were not designed to heat your head.
And Tom Browne brought with him an amazing mascara at the time of Nohepeni.
Many of these masks are colored with colorful fibers and are similar to the Hannibal Lecter.
One scholar would say that entering into the water has respiratory and renal function while the other is similar to the complex ice cream.
And if you like the things you don’t know about fashion, you have a sense of humor.
Facts claim that these signs may also come from where they live.
These are prominent maps in La Bomba', a two-footed solar cluster of people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The book that filled the pages of the conversation has brought another big piece of paper on the coast of the sea and is as big as the shopkeeper’s clothing.
Irfia bagi in orange, with top raffia edges with a white hair of the dead, moving forward to the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week.
"I'm waiting to see big ships and seafarers coming to people in the next kind -- as the designers have gone along," says Luke Armitage, "it's gonna be hard not to miss people who would be selfish" here.
John Edward: Important language skills for people of the world
Schools in Scotland have a reputation for advanced education, and this has continued in 2018 with other non-examination outcomes, which will be strengthened by each individual and the success of a group of sports, art, music and other crimes.
As they have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide a high level of service to their students and parents.
Voluntary schools try to prepare their students for higher education, higher education, and their place of employment as citizens of the world.
As part of the educational program that can be built up and put on a school curriculum that is suitable for conditions, we see the existing languages continue as a favorite and vital education in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, you reach his mind.
If he speaks with his tongue, he speaks with his own heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build up relationships with relatives from other countries.
From the recent results of tests, we can see that the languages are higher in the library at a higher level than in the formal schools.
A group of 68 percent of the students who have learned native languages have found articles in Higher grade A.
The data collected, in 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 per cent of students have received High grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who have learned German, 69 per cent of those who have learned French and 63 per cent who have learned Spanish have received A.
This shows that schools in Scotland are supporting native languages as important skills for children and young people who are desperately looking for themselves in the future.
Now languages, as a choice study, are equally appreciated as STEM (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of the standard schools and others.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by professionals there is a problem with job satisfaction, 17 percent are linked to the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills will be needed in preparing young people for future assignments.
As opportunities for work abound, these skills are important in a cooperative world.
No matter what job a person chooses, if he learns another language, he will have more opportunity in the future to have an endless capacity like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nations has given them many opportunities to learn many languages.
According to the YuGov trial carried out by over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could speak another language well enough to speak and only French spoken by more than 15 percent.
That is why spending money on language is now important to children today.
Learning many languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with the best opportunities to find a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in its own language.
Several schools will pay attention to the existing languages, while others will teach languages that are considered very important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child likes, there will always be several languages in which you can choose from which schools you can study.
Schools in Scotland are determined to provide education that will equip children with the skills they need to succeed, wherever they may be in the future.
It cannot be denied now, in the world’s business situation, that languages continue to be important in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, these languages must be considered "as the ability to communicate with the world."
Voluntary schools will continue to offer this option, sharing and handing out to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron will record Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Only those who want to see LeBron James from the Los Angeles Lakes will be waiting.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play at the Sunday school competition against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it will appear that you will be playing for a few minutes.
"You'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers ’ story says that it is likely that James will spend a few minutes.
After preparing for the week’s training, James became a nationalist with his plans for the Lakers concentration camp.
"I don't want pre-school games at this level of my job to be right," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his early organizations in the morning crowding in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of the five scheduled sessions of the Trump convention this week, which included a visit to the places with which they were associated, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate vote has been suspended until it has been elected to the High Court’s office, this Trump is attempting to withdraw the second aid because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress at the time of the vote on Nov.
When will Trump’s convention in West Virginia be held this morning, and how can you view it online?
The Tromp convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch a West Virginia Trump convention online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak at this week’s meeting of the Supreme Court’s chairman, Brett Kavanaugh, in a difficult situation because of misbehavior complaints that a vote will be taken every week while the FBI is investigating.
But the front cover of this meeting is helping the Republicans to resist the outbreak of November.
As a result, President Trump's crime said that these five meetings this week were focused on "to strengthen the hearts and supporters as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase their numbers in the House of Lords and Houses," the Reuters said.
"The control of Congress is so important to him that the president will come to so many countries as we approach the right time to vote," said Tump's spokesman who did not want to know what the Reuters said.
Organized in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this tonight's event can be supported from "e-Ohio and Pennsylvania and also known in Pittsburgh on the subject," reports West Virginia City News.
The end will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, a government section that won over 40 percent of the articles in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican Useer Patrick Morrisey, who is following this trend.
"It's not a good sign of Morrisey that the president is forced to give him support," says Simon Head, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Riyadh Cup 2018: The American team shows that if you succeed, you will continue to fight as you look forward to each other’s games on Sunday.
After three solo games, playing as the first four is the most important thing this Ryder Cup needs.
The position of progress toward any group has made the idea of real players believing in it, and a similar competition.
In this way, who is making progress now?
"They've paid for six articles and now they're dating, so I think we're moving forward," Jordan Spieth said during that long day.
Europe takes this opportunity, in fact, has four above articles and 12 others can still be confirmed.
The Americans, as Spith says, if you hear that they are going well and that there are so many interested ones in you, it includes the way they play well every day and the two have only three articles.
She has always played well from the start and has been paying for example.
When people were so excited about the joy they were having, they put a ball in an important time to win the game after he and Thomas had been hit by two articles.
Exploiting a ball in a ball can make the game a success when it reaches 15 makes it easier for people to relax the same way, in a way that tells them that the American team can’t be defeated.
"You must be worried about your game at the end," said Speed.
Leave it alone.
The number of digits to round the value to.
Players over Spith and Thomas for the past two days by Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, a story that can be debated by Ryder Cup
Europe’s ways create two kinds of problems and cannot do anything wrong.
"The second called "Moliwood" is the one that can break the bogey in the spring of Saturday and the morning at the end, on Friday and back Nine in the morning.
Such cooperation, along with their interest, seems to be nice to groups as players to be brought to church, and no other famous player can conquer Europe when the sun rises in Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to play both at the same time in different places.
Talk about Europe’s success is not visible, yet
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-year-old bird in the morning, when he got a job with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two other articles on the four front and the Spanish flag and the Swedes were unable to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of that mess.
Four letters and four players will be pleased to see you briefly because of the cooperation of the associated people, their advice, their advice, and how you can change the schedule for a short time.
Europe plays better as a group until now and leads to the last day but four players have shown that the American team is pursuing incredible success if possible, especially the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will be well leading on the last day of Ryder Cup after four articles and four players pay 10-6 in the United States.
A second interest is Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to take Tiger Woods sufferer to make progress in Le Golf National with four articles.
The European Thomas Bjorn case, seeking to win a man who broke up in Hazeltine two years ago, won an American case in the morning with four articles, winning 3-1 games.
The United States did not accept four games, two games, although they were not able to finish the debt.
Jim Furyk’s case requires eight articles from each of the 12 games to be played
Fleetwood is the first European to capture four points of youth at the same time as Molinari, called "Mollwood" after the first two major players win four articles when the Ryder Cup is opened.
When Woods and Patrick Reed were on four rounds, they won Woodsn and American students Brysin Dechambeau on 5 and 4.
Woods, who is left in two final games, shows where he's interested but divided 19 of 29 games into four balls and four players and serve in a row
Justin Rose rested on the morning of these fourballs and returned with his cousin Henrik Stenson to the Foursomes in 21 and 1 that separated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who made progress throughout the world
Europe was a simple father in France.
Jordan Spieth, father of three, and Justin Thomas, did the best they could for the Americans by getting two articles on Saturday.
They got 2 more than 1 when they played with Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter on these fourballs again split Poulter and Rory McIllroy by 4 and 3 of these foursomes divided by two openings.
Both of the Ryder Cup teams return to the division by four articles to each other’s games, although Furyk’s case requires playing in front of the owner and the other to get the prize
After two days, the attack on the Church protected them.
North Korea says 'no' has finished its weapons before it finds security.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs in North Korea has told the United Nations in its conclusion that these judgments are reliable among the Americas and there was no way that America could complete its nuclear weapons when it could receive security assurances.
Ri Yong Ho tells the board of the audience to take positive steps last year, such as halting the testing of weapons and the destruction of nuclear facilities, and to make a promise that we can no longer make nuclear weapons.
"Even so, we don't see any parallel steps from America," he said.
"If there is no promise from America that there will never be any hope for our country's security and in this case we will never take our weapons for America."
While Ri also stated what North Korea had said about the United States’s refusal to resolve nuclear weapons under the terms of which North Korea was rewarded for its small steps, his report did not reveal what Pyongyang had done to solve the problem.
Rii speaks of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between America's president and North Korea's governor in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work "to end nuclear weapons in Korea" while Trump promised to protect Korea.
North Korea wants to end the Korean war of 1950-53 in justice, but America says Pyonyang should end nuclear weapons first.
Washington has rejected requests to reduce the country’s severe justices in the face of North Korea.
"The United States stresses "the end of the first nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure by the courts to achieve their purpose in an oppressive way, against the end of the war," Ri says.
"The idea that the courts may threaten the dream of the lies of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that these judgments increase mistrust."
I had never talked about Kim’s plans for another convention with Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about before the United Nations this week.
Instead, the manager speaks of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean ruler Moon Jae-in over the past five months and adds: "If a group in this nuclear-weapon-free situation is not South-Korean America, then the end of nuclear weapons in Korea would not be me."
However, Ri’s speech is different from last year’s, when it comes to a general U.N. convention. It said that the use of North Korea’s explosive weapons in the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim "the man of deadly weapons".
In this year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, gave Kim a brave song by taking measures to end weapons, but saying that there is more work ahead and the courts will stay far away from North Korea to complete nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time to do it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter"
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, American writer Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's judgments will not allow us to see the complete and secure use of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has reported judgments in accordance with North Korea since 2006 for the purpose of ending the Pyonyang nuclear weapons system.
Pompeo met Ri at the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit the Pioneers again to prepare a second session.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyonyang in July saying there's been progress made, but North Korea itself insisted that he made "the same demands as thieves."
North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could track down the nuclear arsenals that America is "coherent action."
Kim tells her that "coherent steps" she wants security assurances from Trump promised in Singapore and progress towards a common relationship with Washington.
Harvard students have learned enough rest
A new study at Harvard University this year has made all the students who have not yet had enough of this stuff to fight the art of learning all night using caffeine.'
One expert has found that students at this university do not know about the basis of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, a nurse who slept at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist at Brigham and Women's, conducted this study, believed that this was the first time in America.
He was encouraged by his speech about the consequences of inadequate schooling.
When we had finished one of his classes, one girl came to me and said, "Why do you want me to finish school?"
He told me that no one had ever told him the importance of sleeping--what surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
This study was started this year, explaining the benefits of sleeping about education and sports, including improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and a senior medical director at the university, says that the university decided to bring this study back to life after finding students who are not really asleep.
This study takes about an hour to include enjoyable successive activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students emphasized coffeemakers, choices, training materials and books for explanation of the effects of caffeine and light and how sleeplessness affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how sleeplessness increases the risk of heart attacks, heart disease, depression, and cancer.
A school map, with interesting features, encourages participants to think about what they are accustomed to doing on a daily basis.
"We know that the conduct of the disciples has not changed at all."
Even so, we believe they have the right to know -- as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," it means we plant Czeisler further.
The art of casually sleeping is still there, which we say, adding that the art of this time and the pressure on students that makes sleep difficult is growing.
To make sure that you sleep well should be a weapon that is not known to man to deal with stress, stress, and anxiety, as well as to avoid materialism, as sleep is a distraction, making it increasingly difficult.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old in California who studied chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to study the class, after going to his first class on his first year in Harvard.
He says that the class is open - eyed and is interested in making it available to the entire class.
He hopes that this next step will call on the graduates to do the same study program before they enter the class with a competitive spirit.
Czeisler’s concern suggests that students think about making a bedtime alarm, as well as getting up, and being aware of the dangerous effects of electric and LED lighting, which can interfere with your daily routines, which can lead to problems of loss.
Ilvingston 1-0 Rangers Imamga told Gerard's men about one article
The Rangers also had a problem when they listened while Dolly Menga killed Steven Gerrad with one article in Livingston (1-0).
The Ibrox case was interested in winning the first race after St. Johnstone hit it on February 4-1. But Gary Holt's team hit Gerard second in 18th of the game that he started as the manager as eight points were revealed outside the leading group in Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Munga found an article in seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' players were interested.
As the Rangers settled in the sixth place, Livingston rose to the third floor by the Hibernian who left it with one article.
And there are problems with the Rangers after the linassman called Callum Spence was caused by a head injury after he was hit by something that was thrown from the side of the players.
Gerard changes the seven-time player to Air in the game before the end of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, continues with 11 similar players from Livingstone who took one point in Hearts last week and rejoiced in the way his group spoke of its opponents in every way.
The Rangers did not control the game, but Livingstone did more when it found a ball.
Whether to play an article in the second minute when a Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass through Allan McGregor's palaces but the middle player has not found it.
Keaghan Jacobs won a ball won by Craig Halkett, but his wife, Alan Lithgow, was able to open up a lot in the back pockets.
The Rangers did not have control but seemed more reliable than the third game before the end.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should have found a penelope at half an hour's mark as he and Steve Lawless were dating but stormer Steve Thomson had never given up on this Colombian player.
The Rangers were given the opportunity to fight near the ball and the balls before the first part of the game was finished but with trees that had passed the Ibrox Liam Kelly before they had a problem with the ball hit by Lassana Coulibary and Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingstone finds the first article in 34 minutes that has been difficult to find, no one can point out that it is right for them without working very hard.
The Rangers also failed to prevent the football played by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield never acted like Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was not concerned about the purpose of making Menga.
Gerard made a change at first as he changed Couribaliy introduced Ryan Kent to this change and immediately showed the results as the player opened Morelos but the prominent player even ran away from him.
But Livingston continues to make this team go on to play what it wants, and both Lithgow and Halket were playing the ball again.
Holt’s group had an article at the beginning of the game, but McGregor stood firm and looked at Jacobs before Lithgow put his head on the ball.
Another player of the Rangers later named Glenn Middleton has another subject of trial as it was difficult for Jacobs but also rejected Thomson.
Almanc: The founder of Geiger Counter
And now a paper from "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and SIBALA... was born by scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of researching and measuring the function of bees, which was produced by this development a tool known as Geiger Counter.
Since then, Geiger Counter has been used with pop art in this way, as shown in a 1950 film show known as "Bels of Corondao," which interested players are unlikely to be scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things in your ears, you will be able to hear the results of the atoms released from the orbits."
Evans: "Tell me, it's coming true now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his 63th birthday.
But this declaration bearing his name is still alive.
The new strain of cancer teaches body soldiers to ‘see’ hard cells
The new cancer system teaches body soldiers to ‘see’ heavy cells and kill themselves.
Violence teaches body soldiers to see heavy cells as part of a treatment
How to do this involves removing the body’s immune cells from the patient, and changing them into a lab
So they can't see normal proteins in cancer and they're returned to the body.
The strain produces promising effects on patients with various types of cancer.
Another survivor who was treated with this bone, who taught body soldiers to see unusual cells in the body, saw the cancer of the kidney only after 18 months.
How to do this involves the removal of the body's oxygen cells from the patient, and then switch to the laboratory until "see" normal proteins in cancer called HER2, and return to the body again.
A university farmer named Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Agency at Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that we be hit by something that doesn't work."
The HER2 "gives growth of different interest-related cancers." It includes breast cancer, kidney cancer, lung and kidney cancer, explains the University of Bezzofsky.
The same way of removing body soldiers from patients and "instructing" the search for cancer cells has worked on a leukaemia-like scale.
Kanye West Takes Trump's Support Through Speech, Bringing the MAGA Messenger, After his release from the SNL.
Not a Good Journey
Kanye West had never received a study support during Saturday Night Live after a song - singing conversation with American president Donald Trump and said he would enter the program in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, Ghost Town sang a poem written by Make America Great, then spoke against the Democrats and repeated what he said about his support of Trump.
"Many times I'm talking to a white man when they say, "How can you love Trump? You're a man of race."
And I said, If I may take upon myself by reason of the race that is set before me, then I will go away.
The SNL begins its program with a video showing Matt Damon smiling at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Committee of the Court of Justice on sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this video has not yet been released, the West video is placed on the right to speak with readers of Chris Rock.
There is no indication that Rock was trying to joke West with this video.
Also, West won’t be angry with the viewers by joining in with the difficulty before they get into his mood.
"They beat me back here.
They said to me, "Don't go back to your assembly."
I was shocked!
And they took me to the lost place," we said, according to Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see where you're dead?" which means you're going to wear "a suit like superman, because it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try to show love."
His talks had never been supported by SNL viewers and employees with shame, says Variethy, and another person who said, "All our studies are boring."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, who was killed by her uncle, rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
West ranks many by singing I Love It, dressed like Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the PTSASA team, Candance Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "I'm talking to a very brave person: I'm going to make it up to you."
And editor Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "they behave as if they're not real and that's amazing."
"But I made a decision not to salute a person (by buying his music or giving him "not his" support) which I believe has been accepted and exposed to the dangerous ideas of my people.
You are free.
So also do we, which say unto us, If we shall do likewise.
Before the program, this rap singer informed his followers on Twitter that he had changed his name fairly, which was known as "I'm One West in justice now."
He is not the first to change his name and follow Diddy’s steps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His rap partner, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion and an old-fashioned artist named Prince who changed his name to a character.

Game of Thrones pilot Kit Harrington speaks of trying to make a man into a dangerous situation
Kit Harrington was known for carrying a gun as he was imitating John Snow in an ancient HBO violent movie show, Game of Thrones.
But this 31 - year - old example speaks against many people who believe in this powerful image, saying that such roles make young men feel that they are forced to exercise their power in order to gain honor.
Speaking of Sunday Times Art, Kit believes that there's a ‘good thing to go’ and wondered how this problem can be viewed as a dangerous way to try to make a man live in #MeToo
Kit, married to her partner in the Gme of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has allowed her to "feel hard" about the problem.
"I don't know how to speak," he said, "that I am a man."
"The horse that taught men to ride on the colt of an ass, what do we now see?"
Kit believes that a blind person is responsible for the problem of trying to make himself a man in a dangerous way because of her male peers.
He added: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, making boys feel pressured to be just men?
How do I feel about the most important question at this time?
For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
He even agreed to play again at this movie show when he ended up in this kind of future, 'complete with war and horses'.
Since November, Kit will be highlighted in a renewed movie show called Sam Sherpard's True West of the exhibition's storymaker's dance and his ball, which is a thief.
The model says that meeting Rose is the best thing that comes from Game of Thrones.
"I have been with my wife for this time, so that it has been a pleasure for me and for my life from now on."
Rose was like Ygritte, who was in love with John Snow, who was tested by Kit, in this video game to win a lot of competition.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie’s home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new patients
China reported an increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
There are over 820,000 people affected in this country, reports the medical authorities.
The number of people living with this disease is estimated at 40,000 in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
In many cases people are affected by the disease sexually, which is different from what is common in the past.
Generally, most people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected by this decline ended completely, and medical officials in China regularly spoke at a convention in Yunnan.
Last year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV infection is a real problem for the LGBT population in China.
Homosexuality has no longer been a concern in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT has been reported to be difficult.
Because this country has such a negative view, research has shown that men who sleep with 70-90% will marry more people.
Often the impact is not sufficiently protected by the severity of this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters contradicts the details of the GOP's official data published by an employee in court, there has been a 'hard lie' and 'existence'.
U.S. representative Maxine Waters of the U.S.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that these charges were sold by experts and prosecutors.
"A lie, a lie and a lot of lies," said Waters on a Twitter report.
According to reports, home addresses and phone numbers were published by these U.S. netizens. Lindsey Graham and Caroline, along with Mike Lee, including Orrin Hatch, Utah.
These details are posted online on Wednesday, by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at the time of a statement on the lack of self-government and the charges of injustice by the Supreme Court’s judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
These details are published after a while by the negotiators asking Kavanaugh questions.
Wise guides such as the Gateway Puntat and RedState report that IP addresses indicate that the source of data is from the Waters office" until they also published the details of Waters staff, says The Hill.
"These baseless charges are completely false," adds Waters.
"A member of my servants - who is at risk of having his personal details removed because of these non-existent lying buildings - would be responsible for the disclosure of these data.
This baseless accusation is not a lie at all."
Waters' report has been quickly criticized on the Internet, including a former U.S. president's secretary, Ari Flescher.
"This light is better than the sound," Fleisher writes.
"That shows that it doesn't mean to be a Congress member.
When a person is led by something he does not need to feel angry.
You are not obliged to do this too.
There is no need to ask for miraculous purposes.
It's too late and it's too late."
Fleisher might have compared Waters’ response with the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh’s Democrats, who were convinced by critics that he was very angry with the Thursday issue.
Omar Navarro, a Republican audience who attended the Waters graduation during the year, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's big news when it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his peace, Waters says his office announced "the appropriate powers and legal bases with false charges.
We'll make sure that the guests are revealed," he could say, "and they'll legally pay for these dangerous acts of my servants."
Johnny English Strikes Revision Again - Rowan Atkinssos' broken throat
It is common for a few days to look at Brexit’s appearance when it comes to English - related banners as well as that of an old and violent banner by Johnny English - born in 2003 and then came back in 2011 named Johnny English Reborn.
Will this exciting event be the subject of the news that we are no longer able to sell outside nations?
A papyri named Johnny English has found his license to renew his name, which shows that he is a source of encouragement to non - English audiences in other countries.
It is indeed the work of the corrupt government and it is acting in a different way with the smallness of Clouseau, and Mr. Bean and at least one of those young men who sang a song in one of the Chariots of Fire at the London Olympics opening in 2012.
He was also a traveler and a well-known mystery man, known all over the world as Atkinson, who had been imitating Barclaycard's signs, leaving the competitions where he went.
There is a time or two for this show to watch J.J.
I like this time Johnny English comes to a helicopter wearing a front - seat safety suit at a time when he is not wearing his suit.
Atkinson’s gift of non-verbal fun is interesting, but it is not strong when compared with such hard products as 007 and Mission Impossinle that include now.
These stories seem to be about children not adults, when I blame Johnny English’s laughter on my part, it doesn’t show any skills compared to Atkinson’s flashing performances when he plays Bean
The news in this exhibition is that the English are in serious trouble
An online kidnapper entered the online counter, saw the details of all English players working, as well as the role of Kevin Eldon at work - a very small part of Kevin Eldon.
This is especially true of a proud senior manager, who is facing a problem that is not like politics: Emma Thompson is trying to do what is right as Teresa May plays, but her writer is not impressed when she writes it.
Wise counselors tell him that just as all athletes are in danger, it is forced to return to the one who takes the lead.
And that means Johnny English himself, who has been given the position of raising my head in a nice school, but who provides non-principal lessons that are unknown to anyone, at this time English is teaching in an unusual way how to be a actor rather than in real times.
English was returned to Whitehall and was told about this conflict with his former friend Bough, who was suffering with him, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to the captain of the ship walking under the water.
These two capable of doing wrong things in civil service are returning to work, they have met with Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko
Meanwhile, the superintendent believes in a billion - dollar technology that can solve these problems of English computers: this evil man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
English and Bough began to do so: they made food suppliers, burned the French food store; started problems when they boarded Volta's rich ship; and English launched an attack as they tried to use the virtual Reality material for the purposes of learning inside Volta's house.
Everything has been done in the final section, although interesting and enjoyable, there are programs for children who talk about all of this.
Common objects.
Like all other shows, Johnny English plays the harp: Am I wondering if this show can’t give Rowan Atkinson a proper role in his ability?
The task force makes it clear that the British residents are working for four days but are paid five
Jeremy Corbyn’s team arranged for employees to work four days a week — but they were paid five days ’ wages.
According to the report, this group requires corporate managers to require employees to pay for the money they receive when companies operate Artificial Intelligence (AI) by giving them a date.
This change will result in the three - day need for workers — but they will be rewarded with the same reward.
The sources say that this scheme is a 'appropriate' and the economic ideas of this group and the change plan of this country take the responsibility of employees.
Change in a four - day week provides the support of the Trades Union Congress as a means of employment to take the opportunity to economic change.
The top source of the Labour Party tells Sunday Times: ‘ The examination of the programs is expected to be informed before the end of the year.
‘It will not take place immediately, but the working week with four days is an appropriate idea for the new economic balance group to be next to employees and the business plan of this group.’
The working group was not the first to give support to such ideas as this, and the Green Party made a four-day plan when it came to support the upgrade in 2017.
This scheme is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party, however.
"The four-day working week is not a group and it is not a matter of concern."
Assistant director John McDonnell uses a week’s work source to clarify his point of view about the economic transformation that helps people.
Mr. McDonnell says he's willing to take power from 'controlrs who don't want to be seen' and 'profits' in big machines.
The manager's scheme means that the owners of the water-producing machinery do not receive their share as a government of work can pay a ‘tax’ that they do not do well.
He also confirmed his plan to place employees in business positions and made a pool of personal identity funds for the purpose of granting employees a 10 per cent share of the non-profit government to pay them £500
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges imposed by the judge, Brett Kavanaugh, challenged the final vote on his trial in the Supreme Court every week, and raises the question whether the results of these investigations could turn Republicans into changing their minds with their support.
In a conference to be broadcast on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" speaker Scott Pelley asked the Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could help them change their minds.
Kennedy felt troubled by the words of his cousin from South Carolina.
"Yes now" means Kennedy
"I say, 'I will enter into the court,' and 'I will speak to the judge, 'Kavanaugh.'"
When I called to him after this, and said to him, "Do you commit this great sin?"
He was calm, secure, and I was not afraid."
However, it seems to us that Graham’s vote never included it.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there's gonna be a hard fight," he said.
Mr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I don't know what's going on: Brett's got a strong look at these toys," adds Graham, talking to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who speaks of him can assure you of these charges.
36 years
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce the risk?
In this Conclusion, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an event of the annual event with a musical performance that will be followed with a good purpose; the end of the disaster.
The event is now seven years old, and it will host tens of thousands of people in the center; Park is not just to entertain themselves with such airplanes as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to inform them of its purpose to end the disaster by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an additional part of the Global Poverty Project, a global school that hopes to eliminate the threat by adding people with disabilities to its fight.
In order to get a daily ticket (except that you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), you must do a voluntary job like writing an email, phone calls, or whatever means are necessary to appreciate others for their purpose of eliminating danger.
But how successful has Global Citizen since she was 12 years old to achieve her goal?
Is it good to give people a daily thing is a good way to get support - people feel that they make a difference by signing a Web site or by posting a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it is estimated that 19 million actions by its supporters will be taken against different purposes.
These actions have helped to encourage world taxpayers to report commitments and more than $37 million that will lead to a crisis in the lives of more than 2.25 million people in 2030.
Starting in 2018, the group explained the commitments and 390 reports for their actions, resulting in 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that as many as 649 million people around the world earn enough money.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a cooperative fund that has become a tial money with U.K. people who are "to help children grow up to this level," the government promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help address the country's deficit after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Cities.
"With the support of the UK government, the supporters, the governments of different countries and the Global Cities like you, we can be able to address the injustice of the poor," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd about a tragedy in London in April 2018
The group said after 5,000 actions asked the U.K. to improve the proper diet for mothers and children, the government announced money to deal with the problem, using The Power of Nutrition, which helped five million mothers and children to provide food.
When they answered one of the common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can solve a difficult problem?"
The Global Citizen says: "There will be a long and difficult way -- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as human rights reform and antidiscrimination movement in front of us, we will succeed, for we are powerful when we are others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monée, and others will be delighted at this year's event in New York, which will be welcomed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use a water reservoir to prevent Russia from releasing energy from the World’s Central American power plant
America can find security under the water force in order to prevent Russia from selling electricity, including in the Middle East, explains American Secretary of State Ryan Zinke as Washington Examiner.
Zinke complained that Russia had a crisis in Syria when they worked under the government in justice - making a plan to investigate new ways of power generation.
"I believe that their purpose is that the Middle East is to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the power, by the Navy, to make sure that the maritime routes are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their electricity is not on sale," he said.
Zinke speaks with those who are at a conference adopted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that makes no use of what they call "the sound of energy use" in the United States.
He compared America's approach to Russia and Iran, which says they haven't changed yet.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia, almost always, to raise prices and get something else they will put in oil," he said, calling Russia a potential power plant.
The report comes after the Trump government has made efforts to encourage the sale of water - produced countries in Europe, entering Russia, with no high value for Europeans.
As a result, government officials of Trump, including U.S. president Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting North Stream 2, according to Trump's work, has made Germany a "prison" of Russia.
Russia also claimed that this North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, will double its current current to be 110 cubic meters, a very good economic job.
Russia says that the American opposition to this work has economic reasons and is an example of bad competition.
"I believe that the forces are not fit for pressure, and the buyers are forced to be able to select buyers," Russian Force Manager Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with American Force Writer Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The stand taken by the United States in this situation in Germany has confirmed its commitment to this work.
Progress in this business, the German Government School of Commerce (BDI), requests America to move far away from the EU's energy systems and agreements with Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third world is disrupting our power." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Business Government (BDI) after a meeting with German director Angela Merket and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

At the Hall of the City of Holyoke, Warren of Massachusetts, you will be sure to enter the building.

He was arrested and sentenced to house arrests and nightbreaks
"What my son doesn't hear, what he doesn't hear again, I look like other families facing the problems of PTSD and other damages our soldiers are coming back." He told those who were at the level of Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 parts of the U.S. government and D.C. Supporting the light of a new law required their protection
Eighty - eight government departments and the Colombian region are supporting the promotion of a new law on the victims of gang rape or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 parts of the government and the region have put in the form of supporting one of the victims seeking protection against this law, says the NBC.
The complete name of the miracle in this case between Grace and Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union, held on August on the law of an undisclosed country.
He says "with the sons of his violent friends," they abused him, but the US officials denounced his request for protection on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas
Representatives of government departments provide Grace with support from El Savador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the most important places for many people to seek protection in the United States, such as areas facing difficult problems with groups and homelessness.
This new law on security in the United States highlights the 2014 decision made by the refugee complaints board that allowed refugees to flee their home country to find security.
General representative of the Colombian region Karl Racine reported on Friday that this new law "evicts old laws, government departments, compassion and global laws"
"The laws of the public require that all requests for asylum be taken into account in the truth and circumstances of that request, and this law will eliminate it," says the paper placed in the court. "
The officials also said that it would prevent refugees from entering America from ruining the American economy, saying that they were not in business and doing the necessary work.
The agent General Jeff Sessions issued a law that judges may be protected if they run away from domestic violence or gang violence from June.
"The security will be obtained by anyone who goes home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," said Sessions on June 11 when he makes a report on this law.
Security has not been made to deal with all the problems -- I say and hard -- people who face them every day around the world.

I hope you're safe now
A representative of the United States now leads China by using "false statements"
After a week’s legal paper in China has made a daily four - page press announcement about the benefits of America and China, a representative of the United States in China directs the country through the media to spread lies.
U.S. president Donald Trump last week speaks of China’s Dayly blessing on the DesMones Register - the most selling newspaper in Iowa - ema for its purpose of disrupting the Christmas season on November 6, which China condemns.
Trump’s claim that China is trying to disrupt the settlement is what American officials told Reuters that a new section of crime continues before America puts pressure on China.
While it is common for governments in different countries to place advertisements in order to encourage trade, China and the Americas have fought against the current trade and have introduced unprecedented values.
China adds value to the start of the business problem and is being affected by foreign suppliers in government departments such as Iowa support the Republican Trump group, says Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a representative of the United States in China and the former governor of Iowa, sells China a lot of food, say, China has ruined American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes his opinion to the Des Moines Register, "he is now willing to abuse us by putting false ads into our daily newspapers."
"When we spread lies, the Chinese government puts itself at risk of hearing America using its usual habit of freely speaking as well as with news and advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, in the news area here in Beijing when you get off the street, you'll get a little different ideas and you'll never see how the Chinese really think about economic progress in China, we think you're under the Chinese communiqué," he wrote.
He added that "one of the general newspapers that appeared to highlight his request to issue this matter" no matter what paper it was.
Republicans remove excess people before they have been eliminated from the Kavanaugh crisis, warning refugees
As the high - ranking Republicans stand alongside the Supreme Court’s prisoner Brett Kavanaugh and defend him from his criminal charges, the prosecutors say they will see bad lights, especially for the oppressed, in this coming attack of the first half.
The feelings about this situation were too numerous, and the Republicans again said they wanted to continue.
These things you can't repeat later," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of political studies at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill while writing an article published on the Final.
Reeher says you may doubt that recent attempts to influence Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to initiate an FBI investigation may change the mind of angry voters.
"People who are too poor will soon forget what happened to them - they will not steal by face or by November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and a member of the group's group's public press on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors retorted, "Come to November!" on a fragile passport as the Republicans ruled the Justice Committee and decided to continue with Kawanaugh's arrest despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The interest in freedom and encouragement will be great," said a non-human director Stu Rothenberg, telling this story.
"People have begun to say that it's above now, that's true
But it can be much more than this, especially for people who don't decide who will vote with young voters, who are 18-29 years old, who don't like the president but who don't usually vote."
Even before the Ford’s evidence of public prosecutors’ complaints about the Supreme Court’s criminal offence, the prosecutors claimed that there could be adverse consequences when republicans seek confirmation.
"This has become a problem about GOP," says Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee last week when it starts, according to NBC News.
"It doesn't matter whether the vote of the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh enters the jury, about how the Republicans deal with this situation and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil of this press conference, a US Prime Minister, a group that helps to combat democracy
However, the media seem to be unaware of who is trusted between Ford’s testimony and Kavanaugh’s testimony, although there are many who take the latter’s side.
The 41 percent who participated in another survey showed that they may believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent showed that it is possible to fully believe it or believe it as it is in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanaugh could be very likely to be mistaken while giving a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake took an interest, the FBI conducted a study on Ford’s charges and another devil, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford silenced the evidence before the National Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh abused him for 18 weeks when he turned Kavanuagh
Ramirez leads that the Supreme Court officer revealed his secrets to him when he was in trouble while he was in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
A web author designed to create a new network to interact with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the online producer, is starting a new business with a view to interacting with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology channel has a new Inrupt system, which produces a Solid system that is available to anyone.
Isolid allows its users to choose where their details are stored and who is allowed to see those details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee spoke about Inrupt's purpose "to control the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said about this machine.
"It's an unforgettable moment"
This technology access system allows people to make themselves "the data storage site" or the POD.
It can include a list of telephone numbers, a list of things you are forced to do, your calendar, your music, and other personal and business matters.
It is similar with Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time.
Different from this location to store data if the user chooses what they cannot see.
This company calls it "by personal equipment with knowledge."
The Inrupt arrangement, according to the company's senior company John Bruce, to bring together the tools, systems and related skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a program purchased by IBM, employees who improve the system and the people of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology manufacturers around the world can show up a program that makes them all by using the methods available on the Internet.
Berners-Lee says he and his group are talking "with Facebook and Goodley about whether they've published a major change that could end their business immediately.
"We won't ask their permission."
"Berners-Lee says when he wrote to the Media on the conclusion that Inrupt's purpose "is to give business interests and places to protect integrity and the level of the new Internet created by Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while making the World Wide Web Consortium at the University of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in this Internet chat.
And when honestly opened Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet School and the Open Data Foundation.
"I am very happy with the new online section," adds Berners-Lee
Bernard Vann: Victoria cross by WW1
The first and last church to find Victoria Cross during World War I.
Ult. Col. Professor Bernard Vann won this award on September 29, 1918, during an attack in Ballenglish and Lehacourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a fire -fighting cat driver and was no longer aware that in 4 days he would receive the highest salary in Britain.
The monument was opened by two of his descendants in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his descendants, Michael Vann, says that it has been difficult to escape because it has been shown more than 100 years since his grandfather’s death.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Ltd. Col. Vann paid men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with heavy guns and heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled from those who shot him, and with much courage he took those large guns and one machine gun.
Ult Col Vann was killed by a German with the ability to shoot a cat on October 4, 1918 — more than a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's actions "what he doesn't know he'll never be able to do but says it's embarrassing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, had developed a history that became a puzzle after the head of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he feels "as proud as he has participation in the youth" and adds that "the courage of the truth will be shown by many supporters."
MMA supporters did not sleep to see Bellator 206, but they found Peppa Pig
Now think about it, you were asleep because you wanted to watch Bellator 206 just to get together and play.
San Jose's system has already had 13 wars, including six broadcasts at night in Channel 5 in the UK.
On the 6th of the morning, Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were surprised to see the change in Peppa Pig.
Some are as weak as they are all night long as they are in the morning to see the war.
One follower explained that this change occurred while the game was being played as a bad song
"The government's law that since 6 a.m. of the morning of the program may have been inappropriate because they had to change what was not seen by the children, "it means support for the advertising and communication representatives of Bellator, when asked as appropriate.
"Uppappa the Pig," yes.
Belletor's president Scott Cooker says they will change their next time to see the UK's viewers.
When I think about playing it again, I think it might be possible," says Cooker,
"The problem if it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday we won't be able to do this until Sunday.
But we also help with the program
I believe that when it changes with it, it goes into many forms and everything is baffling.
We tried to fix it, thinking at first that our machine problem was our problem.
But it was not so, it was a government problem.
I promise you it will never happen again.
We are going to slow down the wars to five times as much as we used to bring what they expected but we have done so much.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley uses 'small profits' for his sex
The Pacific Ocean pilot Tom Daley says that he is growing up as a minor because of his aggressive nature — but he is interested in success.
This 24-year-old says I see where I'm going to secondary school if I'm "not like other people."
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs program conducted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he says that he speaks of the rights of people from other countries to give them "hope."
He says he's a parent who pays him because he doesn't want to win the Olympics anymore.
The general director of the program, Kirsty Young, has been suffering from illness for months.
Being like someone who was abandoned at Laverne's first funeral, Daley says he felt the smallest while he was growing up because "he wasn't allowed to love boys and girls."
He says, "To this day, the feelings of a child are small and different, the things that have given me interest and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show himself as "something," which means, so that no one would call anyone when they find out about his sexual nature.
The winner who won the victory of the two-twentieth Olympics is still popular with LGBT and has used his fame this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to request non-profit countries to make slavery fair.
He says because he feels so tired to know how to live without seeing problems and wants to give others a "hope."
This world winner three times says to love another man - the founder of America's exhibitions in 2013 - "unexpected."
Daley is married to this Oscar winner, 20 years older than he was last year but says that the space they left behind was not a problem.
"When you look at things like this when you're young," says his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later -- he says it was hard to find a person of the same age as a friend and the same problems of life.
The two of us were parents in June, they found a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "all his ideas" have changed.
"If I asked you about last year, I'd tell you that I need you to get a gold chain," he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Olympic Gold.
My love of gold is Robbie."
Her son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the doctors contracted brain cancer.
Daley says that Dad never accepted the challenge and that one of his final comments was whether he had London tickets in 2012 as he wanted to stay.
"I couldn't say 'you won't be in the front seat'," she said.
"I touched my hand when he finished breathing and I saw that he was no longer breathing if he couldn't live forever," she said.
The following year Daley competed in 2012 contests and won a prize.
"I've seen that this is what I used to dream about -- swimming in the water before the crowd in the Olympics, no way I could feel it," he said.
He was also interested in expressing his first song, Proud by Heather Small - who was always interested in the faces of the contestants and who threatened us.
The Idisert Island Discs is found in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not in playable in a band in the Ryder Cup game on this score
American Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game but has to change how he plays it so that he doesn’t make this movie.
Mikkelson, who plays twice a 12 - year - old game, is placed on the stage by Captain Jim Furyk in a 4 - ball game with 4 people.
Instead of being surrounded by crowds, as is the custom when he obeys the United States, the winner five times uses half of his playful day and once again training them for the purpose of resolving the problem.
The 48 - year - old player is not quite right to play in the Le Golf National, when the game is present and makes it difficult for them to play the ball.
If the color of the game will scare itself, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, confronts Francesco Molinari, who is very fond of the British Open football, who is working with Tommy Fleetwood, who is still studying to win all their games this week.
If the Americans, under 4 articles. That could well start 12 single - game games, Michaelson’s game will be very important.
Furyk shows confidence in his husband as he is expected.
"He would fully understand his role today, he would hold me back a little later and shake my hand and say, 'You'll be ready tomorrow,'
"You really hope.
He found a place in the hall and added more to this group last week, and this week.
I thought I could play two games.
I thought you would play more games than that, but they didn’t go as we thought they would.
He wants people to know him, just as everyone else does."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of many games in Ryder Cup in the Church game.
You can make a decision to play on the Ryder Cup unlike your own record as a person.
Michaelson won 18 times, 20 times divided into seven and a half, even though Furyk said his uncle had brought some invisible things to the group.
"He's funny, he's got broken lungs, the answer is quick, he likes to joke about people, and he's the right person to be in the group room," he explains.
"It was a pleasure to see young players laugh at him this week and enjoy seeing it."
He gives it to them for their good."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that rapid progress can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that we can quickly lose the position of progress as a group is still moving toward Ryder Cup but that can never change.
The race started in 1997 at the game in Valderama, where the case paid by Seven Ballestros progressed five more articles than the United States but was later completed, winning by 1411⁄2-131.2.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderram; you have many articles in Brooklyn, where we are and Valderram, where we have won, hard," said Bjorn, posted in the picture, after watching the 2018 class, he won 5-3 on Friday and he has 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will teach me and everyone in the group that this is not over.
We're going to take out everything we can right now.
We will do everything we can to do what is right.
This does not end until there are items on the board.
We have a purpose, and we can try to overcome this obstacle by focusing on it.
In my speech again, I am referring to 12 players who are next to me, but we know what we're dealing with in this case with one of the most powerful players in the whole world."
Impressed by the way his players played in this hard game, Bjor added: "I never really thought about it.
Then we will talk about something different.
The ability to play is immediately sought, and it is different.
It’s good to have a mate here when things are going well, but when you’re alone, you’re tempted by your own strength as a golfer.
This is the message you are compelled to be found by all players, which must be displayed immediately.
Now, if you don't go with your mate, he will show himself to you again."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, on the other hand, will look at his players and not as a team, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who have only three articles.
Furyk and once twice this last day's revolution, he was next to Brooklyn when he won and when he was split up as Europe did "a miracle in Medinah."
"I remember everything she said," which replied when Ben Crenshaw was Captain of 1999, how he took an interest in them when they were going to the last day.
"We have 12 games right now, but you don't have to think about that as you saw in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When you start winning a game, you put the pressure in the game you're in.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that'll have good results, you know, we want to do something about it."
Thomas is given the task of reimbursing the war and facing Rory McIllroy in the top game, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter from the upper class of Europe.
"I'm going with this group of men in order because I think you're face-to-face," Bjorn says this choice of people.
The German warship has been restructured
The new ship should have been released in 2014 to replace the warship known as Cold War, but in the following year it will not be released because of ship problems and values, says the news.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a ship which pays some of the Baden-Wwettermberg-class frigates, was adjusted in the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit as a military spokesman.
The ship should not have filled the water force by 104, but the arrival of goods has made it possible.
These four Baden-Wurttemberg ships in 2007 and will be replaced by Bremen ships
There was going to be a big powerful instrument, as well as other ships and aircraft and other technologies that made you invisible to radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important step is to take a long time before two years of adjustment are needed.
However, continuing obstacles make new ships - which are said to give Germany power over - are lost in time when they are driven
This ship was released in the past year from the news, while the German Navy was protesting the fair release of the ship back to Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the water force brought the ship back to the manufacturer after it had been brought back.
Little is known about the reasons for the return of this ship but German news reports suggest that there are "mechanical and cargo" problems that make the ship work well which has made this ship useless during the war.
The machines are more efficient as Baden-Wuertemberg ships are used by 120 people at the end - half of the people forced to use Old Bremen.
For one thing, it seems that this ship has a very heavy volume to reduce its ability and that the Navy will not be able to improve it in the next six months.
This 7,000-toned "Irheinland-Pfalz" ship believes that it survives twice as much as such ships used in the second world war.
Despite the materials that are not working, all the values of this work include the training of employees to start using them as a problem.
It's estimated to reach $3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from €2.2 billion.
The problems of new ships become important when it is shown that German Navy forces are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Security Committee, admitted that a water force "was lost by ships that could go to war."
The government says that this problem is as old as it has always been, since older ships have been driven out of the army but have not been put in new ones.
He then said that no other ship of the Baden-Wuertemberg could enter the Navy.
New Trust listens to reports of flying creatures like dragons
A new call made in Scotland’s Highlands wants to explain whether these animals use their own habitat for food.
It was hoped that the results would shed light on the behavior of these animals and how they could be protected.
This is a survey by Scotland's National Trust scientist to follow these common animals, making a sound like soprano, with long ears and daubingtons in Invewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed at an important location in this area to show what they do during the year.
NHS employees and volunteer workers will carry the virus in hand - operated machines.
Sound experts will examine everything recorded to show how often animals call them and what they do.
A map of the habitat of these animals and reports will be made to provide a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation counselor, hopes that the results will be to see how these animals come to be in any kind of place.
These details will help us to identify the benefits of protecting wildlife habitats and how we can preserve wildlife habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has declined over the past 100 years.
They are at risk for the construction and development of habitats for these animals.
The Turbines of the air and light can put these animals at risk, as well as toxic paper and chemicals from buildings, as well as cat attacks.
These animals are no longer invisible.
Nevertheless, the need for daily food is more important to their ears than their eyes when it comes to eating.
They get their food by listening as they come back to their ears and see if they can see what food is or what obstacles they face when they are tired.
The NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 old areas, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in this country, thinks these animals are important.
He has ten trained professionals, who also perform surgery, testing their habitats, and other times of rescue.
This facility provides a place to visit these wild animals in Scotland in Thureve state of Dumfries and Galloway, with 8 species of animals
Local administrator David Thompson says this is the right place for them
"Here in Threave we have a good place for these animals," he said.
"We have old places, old trees and a good place to live.
There are so many animals you don't know about, so our work here and elsewhere will help us explain what they need to live."
He says that it is important to examine these animals before you take care of the area as if the habitat of the animals could be damaged by 400 children and excess, which could end all of this.
These animals are safe and are not illegal to kill themselves, disrupt them, and abuse them and their places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust official, encouraged the public to help.
He says, "There are many things that we must know about these animals, and many other kinds of animals that we don't know about."
Ronaldo has been arrested and his representatives are going to print a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando calls violence a lie, saying that people want to be honored by his name.
Her representatives will pay for the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which is the most in charge of these charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus player has been raped by the American slave trader Kathryn Mayorga, who spent 2009 in the hotel
It is said that he was in debt for $375,000 to say nothing about this event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the Instagram that spreads to 142 million of its followers after only a few hours of these charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, insisted on "false."
"Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha.
What they say today, the lie ended," the winner of Ballon d'Or said five times in the camera.
"They want to make themselves known to people in my name.
It is normal.
They want to know my name, but it’s common to me now.
I'm happy and I'm good," added the player, tired.
Ronalo's doctors say he's willing to punish Der Spiegel for these complaints that say "the unacceptable report of crimes affecting personal life," says Reuters.
Judge Christian Schertz says this player wants a "spiritual damage due to the abuse of personal rights in the past few years."
This event is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a hotel called the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a drinking area, Ronaldo and Mayorga are told to go to the player’s room, where he is raped later, according to the paper placed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga says Ronaldo fell into debt after the incident he was accused of and what "good person" "99 percent" is the problem of one percent."
The paper says that Ronaldo made sure that the couple stayed together, but they agreed.
Miyorga says she went to the police and took pictures of their injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to speak outside the courts because she was afraid that she would bring them back and she was worried about the treatment."
This 34 - year - old says that he wants them back home because he says that he has caused Ronaldo pain.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of his trial, and in this way he went to a large Italian group of Juventus sold for a million euros.
Abrexit: The UK 'will regret it forever' for the loss of car owners
The UK "will regret it forever" when it loses its position to move forward in the production of cars after Brexit, says engineer author Greg Clark.
He added that he was worried that Toyota in the UK would tell the BBC that Britain could go to the EU without a discussion to produce a small amount of fruit in their fields in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," said Mr. Clark.
The manufacturer of cars from Japan says that the speedy exit of goods on the border if there is no report of a merger in Brexit can complete the task.
Burnaston’s production – producing Toyota Auris and Avensis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were imported into other countries into the European Union.
"My idea is that if Britain goes to the EU when Mashi concludes we will see production ceases in our production," says Marvin Cooke, governor of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers expressed their fear of going to the EU without any help as to how to trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will stop its production of the Oxford Mines within a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this can also pose a risk for a neighbor if there is no connection to Brexit.
Toyota's production list is run by "time-to-time" system, and vehicles arrive after 37 minutes from customers from the UK and EU with the aim of producing cars for immediate purchase.
Even if the UK goes to the EU without an addendum on 29 March, there may be a disturbance on the border where the company says there can be tension and supply.
It will be possible for Toyota to have equipment for the day of her production in Derbyshire, which means the factory, and the production will continue.
A colleague Clark says that Theresa May's arrangement with the EU "was designed to address this border issue."
"We need a connection. We need a very good connection that will allow us to take this opportunity," told BBC Radio 4 in a conference called Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we are with a completely successful production."
Toyota did not know how long the production would take, and she says that in the long run, cautioned that increased values would reduce competition capacity in time to finish the work.
Peter Tsoullavaris, who worked for Burnaston for 24 years and who is suddenly the Unit in this report says he's worried about it again. "The time I worked for me I know when this work is going to come back"
A government speaker says: "Instruct us a reliable plan on the future EU
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be resumed, says the U.S. president's office
An important meeting of Donald Trump and with the support of general representative Rod Rosenstein can be resolved once a week as the battle of the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the president.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted research on the disturbances of Russia’s invasion, and a convention between the Trump and Russia’s coup and the presidential coup d’état
That Trump throws something away a general agent, risking Mueller's suicide, has been causing a lot of jokes in Washington over the past few months
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein said he was going to have a talk with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by order 25
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on the last day he went to the White House, among the reports he was going to throw away
_Other Organiser
Trump says "it wasn't an option" to expel Royentin but the meeting was based on the decision to avoid contact with the Senate of the Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the activists who accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Tump approved a FBI week's study on issues contrary to Kavanaugh, which has greatly challenged the full vote of the Senate.
The journalist of Trump, Nksz Sarah Sanders, comes to Fox News on Christmas.
Asked about a meeting in Rosenstein, he said: "The day you were not used, not this week, I saw that the return week was given all other events in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some researchers disagree: Sanders have not been on the White House line since September 10th.
The poet Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says there was no lack of information due to the interference of the "great" TV vendors, although he said, "I won't agree with what they're looking at."
He suggested that you contact directly between Trump and the upgrade press.
"The president made Q&A sessions and sessions rather than any previous president," he added without counting the evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The reports will happen, Sanders says, but "if the printer has an opportunity to ask the president of America questions directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this and you've seen us do a lot of things in the last few weeks and it'll take the place of the press when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump always asks questions when leaving the White House or taking part in an open session or combining sessions with visiting publishers.
Solo news sources are disastrous.
In New York this week, perhaps the president showed why, he made freehilling and some time before he met with the media.
Health writer writes EU employees in NHS Scotland about Brexit fear
The Health Letter writes to the Scottish EU employees in the NHS to express their appreciation for the country and wants them to stay in Post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter of less than six months to the UK moving to the EU.
The Scottish government has devoted itself to meeting the costs of EU-style applications for public services.
In his letter, Nksz Freeman wrote: "At the same time, discussions between the UK and the EU on the issue have continued, focusing on the most important decisions in the world.
But the UK Government has broken down its provisions on the impossible situation.
I know that this must be the most disturbing thing.
So I want to reassess the role of all members of the staff, regardless of their country.
Brothers from all over the EU, as well as above, bring important experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, and encourage patients and the people we are using.
Scotland is yours to stay and we want you to stay here."
Abercrombie Chrisby Ingoes Surgery Emergency After Hearing Head Injury
Tennessee State I-backer Chrisy U-Abercrombie was quickly captured after the 31-27 head attack on Vanderbilt Commodores, a report by Mike Organ.
The Head of Government of Tennessee coach Rust Reed told the press that damage would occur shortly before the time.
"You came to the side line and fell down," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in the way before placing it on the ground and returning the test.
An official from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was not opened at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris adds that there is no "information about the current type/size of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurs.
Abercrombie, the redshirt of phomore (Junior at University, but only in their 2nd year of college football), the first vacation and the state of Tennessee after being transferred to Illinois.
He had five holidays on Saturday before he left the game, which he spent his entire time at 18 o'clock.
Other buyers will be paid when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be paid when they buy a property in the UK and additional funds used to help homeless people under the new Tory arrangements.
Upgrading will reduce Corbyn's success in running a low vote
The increase in camp work will be paid to those who do not pay part-time in the UK
The Fund is expected to raise to £ 120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers of other sales are used to pay higher rates of camp work when they buy goods in the UK - and additional funds used to help homeless people, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will appear to be an attempt to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract small voters by promises to provide for purchased houses and focus on higher education.
The increase in camp work will be paid by people and non-paid offices in the UK, as well as additional funds to improve Russia's fight and sleep.
The increase in the work of the current stage, including the high levels set in the two years ago in the second house and the purchase of training can be about thirty per cent.
Nondwebo expects to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings built in London are sold by people in the UK, to conduct prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet on the level of housing.
Many of the country's riches - especially in capital - have become "city" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend their time in this country.
The new principle comes after a week after Boris Johnson has asked for the shelter to be established to help new people with their homes.
He persecuted large farms in the construction of the maintenance of high - quality property prices by removing the land but not using it, and asked Nksz Mayi to leave the corners of the houses sold to repair British "house shame".
Ms. Corbyn has brought up a list of proposed house - to - house renovations, including rental controls and exits.
He also wants to offer many large bridges to build new houses.
Nksz May said: "Last year I said I'd give your primership to restore the dream of Britain--that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means adjusting our house - to - house work.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not easy for people who do not see in the UK, as well as companies that are based outside, to buy homes like British workers who work hard.
For so many people the dream of home ownership has been too far away, and the destruction of painful sleep remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My top pride is being dominated by Scotland'
Sunderland administrator Jack Ross says "his superior will" is that he is a Scottish manager at some level.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the North-East desk, which is now situated on the third floor of the League One, three on top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light at this moment after leading St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
I want to play my country as a player.
I have B's horses and then, "Ross throws the BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up to look at Scotland in Henden more and more like a child, and it remains a protection for me.
And it shall come to pass, that, if I had done this thing, I would have received it of mine own accord.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The director of Alloa Athletic said he did not have the courage to follow the strict terms on a large desk, which had left places from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"It will be followed by 'Can I return this letter to the League?'
Because of the building and the foundations of this game, there is no doubt that in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to find, but maybe I'll just see if I can make it back to the group."
Ross is only three years old in his career as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in the Coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa jump into its third entry, and changed St. Mirren from the level of support at the level of the Championship in the following area.
And Ross says he feels more at ease than he did at his time in Clyde, Hartplepol, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It could have been a real thing," he recalled, taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the government is ready for me, more than playing.
It seems unlikely that I did well, made a good life in it, and enjoyed it very much.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you need to do each week.
I continue in this way according to the pressures and pressures of the work but the management feels right.
I always wanted to control and now I do that, feeling free to be in my pocket in my life all the older ones."

The finished time of the pint is 5.30pm at the end, the study shows
The type of teatwave has encouraged the release of heavy British mines but has been particularly concentrated on the tourism industries.
Pub groups and bar saw a 2.7 per cent sale in July -- but taking in less than 4.8 per cent of food is shown.
Peter Martin, of the consultative business CGA, who included this number, said: "The continuation of the sun and England for a long time can be expected to take part in the Third World July follow the same example last June, when the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the tourist sites are difficult.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the retail business in June has increased significantly in July.
The problems of drinking and extreme tastes are more like the tastes of the low - food facilities.
Pubs led by food were destroyed by the sun, although they are not just as tourists.
It seems that people want to get out of bed.
Of all the pubs and drinking tastes were more than 6.6 per cent that month, by three per cent. "
Paul Newman, a socialist and receptionist, said to the RSM: "These results continue with the spirit we have seen since April.
Weather and the effects of major sports or sports events are always major when it comes to selling on the outside market.
It is not surprising that the general groups continue to fight, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful at continuing costs.
The type of long heat didn't come at a very bad time for the leading drivers of food and time will tell that the heat levels caught by August will give a lot of breathing."
The growth of sales in general in pubs and shops, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, showing the development of brand outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker of the UK pub, paper and restaurant of the food department collects and maintains a working list from 47 working groups, plus combined sales of over nine million dollars, and a standard treatment symbol.

News has raised the fear of sex being sent.
Twenty percent of students said they run an "important" account to show parents, while alone.
One mother who was disabled at her 13-year-old daughter's level found a girl who moved others to "sex."
The study, with Digital Awareness UK and Head "and Heads of Independent Schools (HMC) found 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 with two reports, and half of those who agreed to keep their accounts.
HMC's king Mike Buchanan said: "It disturbs many new people to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of players" on the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle is selected on the Scottish Athletics board as the governor who is not in charge of the regular meetings of the annual convention.
Doyle is a Scottish driver and Scottish assistant and Internet director Ian Beattie described walking as a good opportunity for those who lead these games to benefit from his superior experience in countries over the past ten years.
"Eilde has great respect for all of Scotland, the UK and the world's sports community and we are sure that Scotland's athletes will benefit from leaving the board," Bette says.
Doyle said, "I like to act like a player's voice and I hope I can help you and help you lead a game in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlantic Games between the Olympics and now the BBC is constantly pounding, is unable to walk after a skemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've been famous for the past month.
I can’t go.
The doctors only say that the time will tell me I’ll be back or whatever.
It was a daunting task but repeated, learning how to walk again and today makes the agitity drills!
I thank you for encouraging messages!"
A community pump advertising by comparing mothers and cattle to sharing Internet opinion
The bee pump company has divided the opinion of online sales and the commercial that describes small mothers in the herded cattle.
To surprise the start of what is called "the first breakable bump," Elvie's technology company removed the theme of music-in-check the inspired video display to show the new freedom the pump gives to the mother.
Four mothers have a dance in the barn with young cattle in the same way as a sound: "Yes, I'm a woman, but you don't see the way" and "If you haven't noticed these things, don't."
The chorus goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, cook it out, pump it, pump it, put it on my girls."
However, the announcement, printed on the movie page of the file, has been made online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of sounds, this video has received confusing answers to viewers, many say it means "intrusion" in the milk industry.
"The appropriate solution uses cattle to announce this production.
As if they had to be pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, unless their children had been stolen from them before the days of birth, "to write one.
Elvie’s heart attack is closely connected within the maintenance level (Elvie / mom)
One said: "The concern of the mother and the child is clear.
But why don't you use the pump pump to keep their children?"
Another person added: "Invisibility to trade."
Some protected them from advertising, another woman who agreed to receive a "clean song."
"I think this is a human idea.
I will have only one if I complete it.
Explosives made me feel like a cow.
The announcement was a bit painful, but I took it.
This is a mental product," one wrote.
One said: "This is a beautiful talk directed to the mother of pumps (usually in their workplaces or secret) and they feel 'like cattle.'
This is not an advertising that honors or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of teenagers showed that they were all playing with explosives.
The theme behind the crime is based on the idea that many well - known women feel like cattle.
Elvie Pump, then, is completely silent, there is no wire or bombs and is firmly intertwined within the bridge, gives women the freedom to walk, takes their children out, and leaves.
Ana Balarin, a balanced and ECD to Mother said: "Elvie's smell is like the transformation product that was supposed to start with courage and enthusiasm.
By showing the similarity between showing women and the milk cows we wanted to place the milk and all the ingredients available, while showing how to enjoy and how to look at the mindless freedom that new freedom will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has a title.
During the week of the Mondon Fund, the mother of two children appeared in the designer’s catwalk by Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Many Rivers are busy in the Texas Borderr Tent Camp
The number of children who have been used by immigrants has gone out, although the monthly boundaries remain unchanged, due to the burden of control and control policies of the Trump system making it difficult to place children and supporters.
According to tradition, many advocates have become out - of - date in other countries, and they threaten their country’s survival by moving on to raise a child.
The danger comes from June, when government authorities declare that supporters and other senior members of their homes must wear fingerprints, and that the disgrace will be shared with the authorities.
In the last week, Matthew Albence, a senior member and the Change in the Past and the Dissemination of the Past, testified before the Conference that Argente holds many people who apply for support from non-participated children.
The Argentinian later confirmed that 70 per cent of the victims did not have legal reports.
"Nearly 80 percent of some support or family members are here in this country illegally, and the main cause of these foreign crime cases.
So we keep looking for these people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to make rapid progress on children, officials promise new laws that others will want to appear in court in the prison month, not long after 60 days, which are the first rules, in relation to local workers.
Many will appear on the cover of the phone, rather than in the presence of a person, to excuse their case in the legal situation in the refugee court.
Those considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
For a long time, children may be anxious or depressed, which may lead to the end or survival of their children, according to wealthy workers and reports that have appeared in the months to come.
Supporters say that this concern has been raised in such a large country as Turin, where the child’s difficult symptoms may be forced to, as a result of its size.
Please add that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time for physical preparation or saying that friends can cause much of the damage they are experiencing.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkey to depend quickly on it
In front of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, although the country's war is now the eighth year.
Moulalem, who also serves as a supporter of the regime, says that the foreign forces in the Syrian world are illegal, under the meaning of war and violence, and "will be properly taken."
"They have to move quickly and there is no limit," said the congregation.
Moualem stressed that "an emergency war is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died in 2011, and millions of others are taken out of their homes.
Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until we have finished all Syria's territory."
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and recommending Kurdish troops as well as Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 wars on earth in a war - torn country
In the case of refugees, Moualem says these restrictions were prepared to return, and he said "some Western countries" because of spreading unreasonable fear that made refugees stay far away.
"We have called national areas and human organizations to prepare for this ransom," he said.
"They've taken care of what needs to be people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reform in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN's allies say the new agreement between Russia and Turkey to be established at the level of the summit created an opportunity to advance political talks.
A Russian speech in Turkey attacked a huge Russian attack at the church, where three million people lived.
Moualem but stressed that the agreement "has been long" and expressed the hope that the participation of the war will be directed to the Jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-related fighters with Nursra Front, "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will join the first meetings of the new committee consisting of government members and opposition to the creation of the principle of the Syrian war and the path of election.
Moualem placed conditions for the Syrian Government's detention on the committee, saying that the panel's work should be prohibited from "reviewing the current principles," and warned of interruptions.

In that sense, Mr. Trump will succeed in the 2020 election unless, most liberal viewers may have hope, deviations and distortions end his president in time.

It is not surprising that the 17 of Pennsylvania sees a flood of debris, due to the transformation of the charges I attach to the affected areas of the same station.
The former was destroyed in the city of Pittsburgh, then in the Democratic Rep.
Wundlu works against another authorized person, Republika Keith Rothfus, who now has the 12th Pennsylvania porter, which carries 17th more.
Maps were resurrected after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania passed a judgment in January that the older islanders were not under the principle of the favor of the Republic.
The 17th new competition will feature the financial campaign of the Lungfest between the major groups of funds, the Democratic Committee of the Community Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic of Culture (NCRC).
The Wundlu became a common name in Pennsylvania after a small small visit to a special island in the 18th Central District district of Pennsylvania.
This seat was run by the Republic for more than a year, and President Donald Trump won a 20-degree victory.
Political policies give Democrats a small border.
U.S. Equalize Penalizing El Salvador With China's support, then supported
Diplomats say that the Roman Republic and Panama have chosen Beijing, not to leave Washington.
Mr. Trump had a fine meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner was expelled from the Trump Organization.
Government officials have decided to return American guests from El Salvador, the Roman Republic and Panama to "with the previous decisions of destruction soon to be seen in Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, who spoke to the Sebe, on a Saturday in this month.
But judgements were considered only about El Salvador, which received about $140 million in 2017 with American AIDS, including drug control, development and economic support.
The planned events, which include the withdrawal of financial support and the targeted visa restrictions, would be painful in the North American country and the absence of higher employment and the level of death.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and North American officials eased a high level of security and economic prosperity to follow the same meeting last year as it was seen as a first step to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted the source to move forward, completely ending any review of El Salvador's judgments.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now ready to meet the polls, now set up in October, in the introduction of control points to this conference.

The next instructor may be Robert Mueller’s special advice on protecting justice by Mr. Trump’s report, where there is much evidence in general.
Mr. Mueller is said to have responded to his investigation and to Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper said, last year, he was secretly advised to write to the president and to explain misinformedly to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Time account is invalid.

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans hope for Ripid Vienna
The Rangers Army Ruudid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory of the Austrians, after Spain's follow-up against Villarrear at the beginning of the month, will place them in the right place to fit into the European League.
The damage of the joints prevented the line between Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of time until this 2-2 drawing with Villarrear but he believes that Rangers can use that effect as a means of doing great things.
"It was a good article because Villareal is a good thing," said this 31-year-old child.
"We went to the game and believed that we had something to come and went on.
Perhaps we can handle it eventually but, generally, design may be a good result.
They may be better off on the first floor and came out from the second and the right half.
On Thursday, one of Europe’s greatest things.
Hopefully, we can find three articles but it will be a difficult game because they have a good role in their final games but, along with the next group, I’m sure we can move and have good results.
Last year it was very difficult, between everything that happened and my injury, and changes in the group, but there's a field of feedback about the place now.

Government persecutors seek the death penalty of NYC
New Yorkers sought a death sentence on Stévelo Saipov, a New York City prosecutor for an attack on the brave killing of eight innocent people that had not been committed during police crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, says he used Loto Doto to launch home attacks on the road along the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, to pay passengers and bicycles on his way to Octoba.
To be sentenced to death, persecutors will have to testify that Saipov "for the purpose" killed eight victims and "for the purpose" caused physical injury, following a notification of the purpose of seeking a death sentence, which was imposed on North Pacific in New York.
Both of those figures ruled the death sentence, according to the court’s judgment.
A week after the attack, the jury ruled Saipov on 22-count of charges that included eight deaths in order to help the integrity, which were usually used by the prosecution prosecutors in criminal matters, as well as the penalty for violence and the destruction of transport.
The attack was supposed to be "great planning and conspiracy," the persecutors said, explaining how Saipov did "as evil, immoral and true."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury, and loss of family and friends of George Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucci," a report for purposes.
Five victims were visitors from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Northern Hemisphere in New York stressed the death penalty again.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed on the New York case in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple were killed after being found guilty of holding the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by a bomber on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a source of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of self-restraint during the days and months following the attack, according to the documents of the court.
He told the researchers that he was very aware of what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to continue the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the case.
He was asked to show the ISIS leaflet at his hospital, the police said.
You're charged with a census-count.
David Patton, one of the authorities responsible for Saviv, said that they "publicly insisted" on the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to get a death sentence rather than accept the sentence of a criminal sentence in prison is nothing to be released will increase the full time of this participation for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked not to seek a death sentence.

From the summit, Bottas began and almost stopped Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two points and invited Vettel to attack his mate.
Vettel entered the first halls and left Hamilton to run into a pack truck, which he had to make a decision.
Mercedes released the shot later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after a move on the line that we saw the driver of Ferrari leaving unmannedly at risk of arrest after twice as many times as possible in order to protect the third line.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the grid and became seven at the end of the first crime on his 21st birthday.
Then he led them to a large part of the competition as he held on to his mats to speed up and take Kimi Raikkonen IV.
Finally he entered the streets on page 44 but could not raise his jaws to the remaining eight times as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valter was doing a good job every week and was a man who told me to let go.
The group has done a special job for you to have a second," said Hamilton.
The group did an impossible job to be a second," said Hamilton.
President Donald Trump greeted Senator Diane Feinstein at the meetings on Saturday because of his unconfirmed pressure from Christine Blasey Ford to condemn the Supreme Court’s prisoner Brett Kavanaugh for his violent attack.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not clearly state the evidence given by Foeyi before the Courts' Courts Committee, instead of focusing on what happened in the Senate shows that people were "speaking and updating and being firm."
One thing that may have happened and a good thing is going on in the last few days at the Senate, when you see the noise, when you see people burning and talking and talking and not saying, "he said.
"When you're looking for the extraction and the reward and they say," oh, I didn't.
I couldn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, are you kidding me?
Remember his answer... do you reward the envelope-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, come on.
I couldn't get up."
Yes, wait a minute.
No, we didn't go out, "add, at the senator's level.
Feinstein sent a letter to Kavanaugh by Foron in July, and it was alive early in September - but Feinstein was not satisfied that the reward came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's reports, I didn't tell her story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as he asked."
But her light didn't seem to be in good order with the president, who said about the night's end: "I'll tell you that, that was the worst part of the body.
Maybe he didn't, but it's the worst kind of body I've ever seen."
To move on to protect the Supreme Court Judge, condemned by three women for sexual misconduct, the president explained that the Democrats are used by their judges.
"They are willing to return the strength in any way necessary.
You see the benefit, the injustice, the carefreeness of who does wrong, who must work to take power and control, the Mediate told the president.
Elite League: The Dundee Stars 5-3 from Gelfast Giant
Patrick Dwyer played two Goals at Giants playing with Dundee
Dundee Stars has attacked the Elite League lost by the Belfast League by winning the Dundee back game on Saturday.
The major characteristics have two major consequences for Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the floor before the Dwyer returned the Giants.
François Bouchard is related to Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen discovered the goals.
It was the third Elite League victory of the Adam Keefe men, who came after killing Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth - time meeting between the parties, and Gitas won three games.
Dwyer's opener came at 3:35 from Candall McFaull to help, and David Rutherford offered assistance as Beauvillier twice in four minutes.
When it was open, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 in the game before Matt Marquartt became Cownie's spectator at 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed that Giants were sent to the first exit when they beat his second goal at the end of the first time.
The side of the house is connected to Buchard again to level levels and the game of power at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcor joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the first leader in the game after the second time and made sure he was successful at his fifth level at the last level.
The big characters, lost by the last four games, live in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Moto traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of thousands on the planet can escape earthquakes
An Indonesian Internet traffic controller is served as a fugitive after his death to ensure that the transport carried by hundreds of people is safe in the world.
More than 800 people have died and many have been lost after the massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunami.
Continued exploitation continues to cause suffering in the lands and many are stuck in the hard - hit areas of the city of Palu.
But while working with them running away from their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the air traffic control level in Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was convinced that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the way back then, was able to walk safely.
Then she went up to the traffic control level when she thought she'd fall.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait says that a decision can save hundreds of people, Australia ABC News reported.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balkpan in Kalimantan to visit him at a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we have escaped this morning before the helicopter arrives in Palu.
"Our heart listens to hear about this," he added.
At the present time, the authorities feared that death penalty would reach thousands and that the country’s disaster reduction rate would be determined by reaching the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Botong.
"The evil believes that the survival of many bodies during the days was under the control of the mass destruction process, while many can't reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The peaks up to three feet [6 m] destroyed the Palu to hold the mass mass on Sunday.
War vehicles and trade bring relief and services.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says to Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is fresh.
Day marks are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Cross Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: and the Indonesian Cross is quick to help survivors but doesn't know what they've got.
This is already a disaster, but it can be even harder."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday and explained the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the migration-related duties.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was held early in the year of the Lombok earthquake where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia's flight altitude: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a car crash
The airline operating in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, after all 47 passengers and employees safely walk into the vehicle.
Air Niugini says freely that at the end of the day, he couldn't answer about the man who was with him.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find a man.
The airline did not respond quickly to many requests about the passenger, such as his time or nationality.
Local ships helped to rescue other passengers and workers after the plane hit the water while trying to reach the Chuuk Island airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were arrested in the hospital
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all on the line.
What made the confusion and direct sequence of events easier.
The airline and U.S. Navy both said it would reach a short line of road.
Some Witnesses thought that the car was passing by on the street.
American pilot Bill Jaynes says that the plane came very low.
It's a very good thing," said Janes.
Janes says he and others were able to dive into deep water at the time of an emergency exit in an abandoned vehicle.
He says that the mountain goats are anxious and cry out, and he has a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said that businessmen who worked close to developing wharf also helped rescue by using a goffable ship to transport people to the water before landing the disease about 30 kilometers (about 100 levels) of water.
Data from the Security Network show that 111 people have died from an air traffic disturbance recorded in PNG over the past two years but nothing has been included in Air Niugini.
The sun is set on the star of the night
Its persecution is finally judged in the retrieval of a person who was burned by a woman in Mississippi who lived in 2014.
U.S. Lunska Institute of Science Paul Rowlett witnessed only hours of technical evidence in the fields of knowledge management.
He explained how to use phone records to join and increase 29 years of age, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of death.
Rowlett said he found a spot on many phones that indicated that Tisis had Chambers on the night of his death, in opposition to his previous accounts, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the thief shows that his phone had Chambers at one time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police are going to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on the Cross and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the persecutors asked that Tellis was telling the truth when he said that at the Sanford clock that night, Sanford said "he came because my friend went to Nashville."
Another difference is that Tellis knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
The phone records show that they only know one week.
Rowlett says that after the death of Chambers, Tellis was removed from his cats Chambers, telephones, and contact information on his phone.
"He removed it from his face," said Hale.
The protection is planned to start its closing talks on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to go to the judge later that day.

Singers like Fugees and ordinary people have seen the current re-up in the UK using musicians like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY and Sues two after shooting after the word "ethnicity"
New York and Nny are the second to be quoted after getting the wrong ticket from the mothers who complain "is another black person."
These two deny that they're different, comparing the suut to "injury."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she found out that the servant of the new child, Giselle Maurice, was dark when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other child," wrote Nksz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the paper.
Nevertheless, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Nksz Maurice, twice.
After observing his gaffe, the "not worrying" Plasco-Flaxman was removed by Nksz Maurice, who was an African, did a bad job and instead waited for the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Unksz Maurice was paid one working day and returned home on Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for a return, and she wants to spend $350 a day on the 6 months, the gig she's staying at first, if there's no agreement.
"I want to show myself, look, don't do such things," he said on Friday, adding, "I know it's against."
The two of us have endured racial charges, claiming that leaving Maurice’s job was reasonable, fearing they could trust him after he was upset.
"My wife had something I didn't like to say.
He is not a nation.
It's not ethnic people," Joel Plasco's husband picked up the Post.
"Can you place your children in the hands of a man who has hurried, even though they are wrong?
Your child?
Come on."
Comparing the suite to "fucking," Plasco says his wife was only two months old if she had a child and was "hard".
"Will you follow such a person?
That's not the best thing to do, "the bank of finance has been added.
Although the case continues, the human court is quick to look at the second recorded in human media, to their moral and mental welfare.
Paddington’s publishers were afraid that the students did not agree with the beer they were talking about, a new book showing
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It’s hard to put herself in someone’s shoes before it was printed.
I'm amazed now we know about great success in Paddington."
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book of children on a small bill, would be a man who would be impossible about his work that was banned, adding that 60 years of this book was nice "after his death last year.
In Paddington, explaining that "the most important member of the family," he added his father was automatically confident of his success.
"He was an old man, and he wasn't a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to him, it was hard for him to have a child to imagine something: he is proud of himself even though it is not true.
I think he was looking at Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and his mind, he always gave him a loan to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dead and I had to lie on the phone
There his daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were working on iron to save her life.
"Nad often called it wrong, if he didn't expect to do it," said Nksz Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say he'll die within two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, I love you.
Soon I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The surgeons gave him a heart attack and abandoned his program.
He had been missing some time before, and this was all locked up.
I had to stay and wait, knowing that everything was going on.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was put in a condition around my family and people.
I had to hold it together."
Finally, Miss Ednan-Laperouse, now sad that her daughter had lost her daughter, flew off the plane with other passengers who were not aware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
"I touched my head, and tears were always known.
It was hard to explain, but it was in this atmosphere that I felt this kind of kindness toward Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved him."
Aim to place the suits in the order which fits the current layout most naturally.
Two women who lost loved ones in death tried to protect others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh bridge and encouraging messages and phone numbers that can call support.
Nksz Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to know how I feel every day," he said.
Nksz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Sydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious disease.
"Everyone knew it because of his smile.
And they spake always against him in the matter of his sleep.
However, he left work before he died, as he was in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was able to find his brother after he died.
"I always wonder if there'll be a ring," said Nksz Davis.
Unks Davis created cards, "to let people know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, even if I'm a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Nksz Humphreys, who had been friends with Nks Davies for years, lost Marco, his 15 - year - old partner, shortly after Mother’s death.
"It doesn't mean she was under or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
She was on the street down at Christmas when the children opened their gifts without arguing with them or anything."
He says his death was a great sacrifice to them, but they had to work on it: "You celebrate the funeral of your family.
Utahla
But we should all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI starts research
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked -- a short study at the time, limited to space--maybe we could add a little unity," said Mr. Flake on the conclusion, adding that he was a committee "the separation" between the combined gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Not all want it for the time.
The last five weeks are the last five weeks, on November 6 if, as expected, the Republicans do wrong, so they will be too weak in their efforts to find a man who wants to be brought to justice on earth.
George W. Bush kept calling on the senators, asking him to join Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the West House at Mr. Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happened after the FBI published its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republicans and 49 Democrats will now sit down.
It is not clear that Mr. Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes at the Senate level, which will allow Mike Pence, the president of the House, to vote and assure him at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'bottom' decoder number under Kim
The number of North Korean authorities to South Korea, reported from Kim Jong-un seven years ago, says a South Korean representative.
The Byeong-seug package, which pointed to a decline from South-South cooperation service, said there was 1,127 protection last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says that the border between North Korea and China and the high levels paid by top-down people.
Pyongyang did not make human ideas.
Many of the poor from the North are eventually offered by the people of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people in North Korea have fallen illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, the longest border in North Korea and it was easy to cross the DMZ between two Koreans.
China refers to migrants as illegal migrants rather than refugees and repeatedly repeat them.
The relationship between the North and the South - which was legally active in the war - has been extremely successful in the coming months.
Earlier this month, two international leaders met in Pyongyang with talks focusing on interfering talks.
This occurred after a June event between American Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean peninsula without a nuclear.
But in the end, North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong-ho says US courts because of lack of progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no way we will abuse it first," said Mr. Ri a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois calls Brett Kavanaugh "third," says he's not ready to serve in the Supreme Court
The little head of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the senior of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "third" and said that he was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelos responded to the final discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but I think if I were a woman who had done that way, they'd say they were 'blow'," Pelos said about his reply to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Court's Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was legally authorized to smoke drugs by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During the opening, Kavanaugh felt very much, sometimes crying and joined in when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He clearly condemned democracies on the committee, calling them "a common bond and human equality" which were included by the non-governmental organizations that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 election of the whole.
Pelois says Kavanaugh believes that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he has shown that he is being abused by the Democrats.
"I think you're preparing these explanations and how you follow the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When asked whether he would try to disrupt Kavanaugh to be confirmed, Pélois was stressed, and that the Democrats find much in the House of Priests.
"I'll say this -- if it doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be a Supreme Court, but to be in court right now," said Pelois.
Kawanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Court of Justice.
Pelos added that as a democracies he was concerned about the execution of the Kavanaugh Act or Roe v. Wade, as considered to be a last resort.
In his conviction that he was imprisoned, Kavanaugh had answered questions about whether he could change some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It's not the time for a dangerous person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'it's not that," said Pelois.
And women want to protect it.
A good diet, a month and years of heat burning, and can't do it without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," Nksz Steinem said to me 45 after that.
"I don't think of something unusual, do I?"
He went on, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a ruler in a certain place, who said, 'He cried when he cried,' but he gave birth to a procedure which meant that when he cried out and began to cry, he said to the man who said to him, 'You think I am sorry because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept walking.
And I thought there was wisdom."
Tears are allowed as an entry into the stomach for something because they are not fully understood.
One of my violent memories is of my first job, at the office run by a man, where I found myself crying in unbridled rage, because I was stuck by the screw in my neck by an older woman--I'm always very scared--who's the one who drove me to the station.
"You won't let them see them cry," she told me.
"He doesn't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because they're coming to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then the Colorado Democratic Society, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential career.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in a ship's outhouse called the Monkey Shishin and left the competition, Nksz Schroeder, was very concerned, he might have thought that he could not have found the idea of driving the president himself.
"There was no good decision," he said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were seven hearings in the race, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called it "Snow White and Seven Loves."
Because it was behind crime, it was behind financial support, and he swore he wouldn't get into the competition unless he grew $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who gave 1,000 money to the men were only going to give him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a drink?" he asked himself.
When he made his speech that announced he would not put up a legal propaganda, he was overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration and a program that made it more difficult to raise money and raise votes than to be sent, and with anger at sexism - if he was raised.
"You think I'll be disturbed," recalls Nksz Schroeder about how the printer responded to him.
"You think Kleanex was my partner.
Do I recall thinking, ‘ Will they lay their hands on my stone? ’
"You've got it?"
The U.S. war on trade can be a good thing in Beijing
The salvos of the open war between the US and China was a hero, and while the fight was far away, the conflict between countries was rather useful to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of the year by recording Chinese external talks including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
A significant increase is made this week with new taxes of $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, due to the amount of everything coming from the US from China.
Beijing is reimbursed again and quickly restored, the rates are before paying five to ten per cent in $60 million.
China promised to compare US shot-shot, and most of the world's largest economy could not join at any time.
Getting Washington to go back to the bottom means taking orders, but the United States will be very ashamed of Mr. Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the US military pressure can certainly help China over a long time by reducing its dependence on other countries.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can make situations that begin to leave the economy in this country really more dangerous than the spectators have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a friend who has gone to Asia, says the New American Security Culture, thinking tank.
Syria 'prepared' refugees to return, says the National Council
Syria says that it is willing to return to the refugee camp and encourages help to rebuild a country destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam says that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation under the world is certainly grateful for the progress made in protecting gratitude," he said.
The government continues to restore damaged areas to restore the habit.
All situations now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have traveled because of violence and the uninterrupted economic standards that center their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians who have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Some six million people living in this country are seeking human help.
Al-Moulam says the Syrian government will accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept help with restrictions or assistance from the countries that support it.
