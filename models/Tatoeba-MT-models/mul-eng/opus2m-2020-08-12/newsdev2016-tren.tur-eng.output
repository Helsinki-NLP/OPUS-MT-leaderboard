Norvech's rakfism: Is this the world's largest fish?
Norway's five million people enjoy the highest standard of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.
Could the country's success be linked to the local fishing industry?
Take a past paint selection.
Place these in the center of the collection of bad, fast football.
Leave me alone for a week.
Now you're one of the great Norwegian tattoos that's gonna poison your teeth. You're hungry.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a car, a great manra -- and this smell always comes from the air.
Rakfisk is a blessing that has been cultivated for over a year as a result of your love for cococcal fish.
When it's dark and the air is cool, the Norwegians gather here for a festival that has been called the biggest meal.
"Rakfisk Generali" Havard Havard says, "If you put it away, then you'll eat a glass of water."
People around us eat little fish cubes and watch lots of drinks.
Havard says, "Some people like aquavit more than arakfisk."
It can kill the drink.
I'm trying a few pieces.
It's not bad if you can avoid going under the bridge – it's a little bit different from a Sushi language after a long bus trip.
Rakfisk Norvech is a very different example of the cold weather expected in the water and in the winter before the ice.
Then, when it has reached its maturity, it will be taken out to its place of rest, and it will indeed be followed by those who listen to it.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, and most of them moved to the United States.
Now the spirit is expanding rapidly -- more than 13 percent of jobs, high wages, and migrants attracted by a comprehensive care system.
People from Switzerland, which is much richer than Norway, are working for jobs in the past and very soon.
Rakfisk represents something important, though it's a bit of a bit of a comfort to Norway's history, but it's a part of life.
Among the cheapest food you can buy.
But everything is worth it – you give £9 (14) to a little beer beer or a sandwich.
Norwech often does not come to the world’s news day – and most people like it.
We'd like to talk about the name of super-right leader Anders Brevik who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it's called "22-inch" murder.
Norwegians are forced to believe that one of them could commit such cruelty and murder in their countries.
Since the early 1970s, Norway's wealth has grown to one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
Our Garson, Anna Nordik's image of a long-haired, long-haired hair and long-haired blue eyes, says, "But oil is not the only reason why we're so good,"
We are, as you say, a people devoted to Allah.
English, like most people here, is innocent.
We don't show too much, we don't like entertainment.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully – the small percentage of money from industry is invested in a special fund for future generations except for future generations.
In the years of the global financial crisis, when the money was spent that everyone didn't have, Norwech often tied up the coins of the Norwegian bank.
"We're happy as long as we can walk through the mountains," says Anna.
"And when you're hungry," he adds with a calm smile.
I'm standing on the street and waiting for something to eat. I've had enough beef.
Now there's definitely something different about the first hamburger and a more pleasant taste.
But there's more tonight than that cococ.
One of the many places I've stayed at the hotel is where guests here are the best – and perhaps the most demanding – to fish.
There's a live television connection on a spinal paper server with Rakfisk's cigarettes.
It's like a Eurovision song competition.
"How many points do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our money is here, Howard."
There's wolves, there's wolves.
A man's falling off his chair, maybe the influence of Aquavit.
Or maybe from the taste of all these fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start
While Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to go through the office, he looks at the difficulties that will Grant has faced from BBC and his people's mixed expectations.
Mexico's traffic is particularly bad at this time.
In the best of times of trouble, since the day of Pazartes, it has been the reason why it has been on its way out of the middle of a nation.
But the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching school.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take the lead and will be entrusted with the responsibility of managing the country.
In the face of a violent task.
Felipe Calderon, who continues to play a good role in the economic performance of Mexico, is under the control of a drug war that has led to 60,000 deaths in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama this week, "There is a big word for the people of Mexico to reduce the violence of my government," he said.
I'll try a new security strategy that will help us achieve this goal.
Mr. Pena Nieto's first political experience with the U.S. partner was held in Mexico's own state.
The majority of the presidential majority, which grew up in this old area, is in a situation where new leaders are divided.
An open-minded man
For example, it's remembered with love in the village of Valle del Bravo.
People here think he's practicing tourism instead of his holiday and he's making a subpoena.
You can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new cars to get to town, a great progress on the changed roads and alleys.
The posters that bear his name are also based on the change in the modern sports centre and the interactive climate change museum.
"We look at him to bring about real and lasting change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and political party member Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of the State Congress of the State Party of the Political Party.
In particular, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs in terms of security and economic development.
After 81 years of inexorable power, PRI was converted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera recognizes that he has a lot of expectations about Enrique Pena Nieto at the party 12 years after the Los Pinos presidency.
And the mayor refuses to introduce the new leader to himself.
An open-minded man named himself with a beautiful country vision.
A man with a great government and listening to everyone.
But that's not the idea that many people in the other part of the state are dealing with their old habits.
The city of Neza, also known as Neza, could not be narrower than the streets of Valle del Bravo's park in Neza, known as Neza, in Nezahuaalcoyotl.
It's a restaurant in Mexico City with a lot of open air under the highway.
And the problems in the environment are difficult and civil.
This year, he was called to help combat drug abuse in the military, and he was particularly violent against women.
She was shot by a woman's body only two years after we were killed in an empty space next to a large cave area.
Mr. Pena Nieto was killed by more than 1,000 women in the state of Mexico, more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, known for its violent crimes.
Mr. Pena Nieto's clients said they couldn't even address the problem of female murder in the best way.
The worst thing is they're guilty of coming to see his rule.
In a typical concrete house in the kitchen, Irenea Buendia is trying to fight with her age when she shows me pictures of Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana graduated in 2010.
But he believes his family is killed by his partner.
"When I went home, it was like a dead body," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs showing that he was beaten, and death had already begun.
His mother looked down from a formal wall of Mariana, with a single word on it: Justice.
But what this family said was completely rejected.
The authorities treated me like an old-fashioned old man.
What they want is simply to accept what people say and close their doors.
"But it can't be true when there's so much irregularity and frequency," he says.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico, and he has promised to give them priority during the new presidential role.
PRI Congress member Olvera says in Valle del Bravo, "It's like my hope is a president."
But this is the most frightening of the families of victims in the city of Niza.
Bradley Mann didn't complain about the bad behavior, the prosecutors say.
Critics are trying to resist Bradley Manning's evil ideas.
The situation is concerned when Manning's military in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case if Manning's jail is severe.
Every thousands of secret documents in the army are accused of playing
On Friday, the defendants tried to indicate that the U.S. military accused of the largest hidden material in the U.S. history had missed more than one opportunity to complain about the bad behavior ideas of the army of Bradley Manning.
Ft. Meade Maryland, the prosecutor at the cell before the trial, Mr. Ashden Fein Manning, said that while Quantico was in charge of nine months in Virginia, he did not have a complaint about the week's misbehavior records.
One day when Manning's case was brought to an end because he was severely tried and sentenced to a severe prison term, he said he was thinking of his sentence when he was in charge of Manning's defense.
The army that was arrested in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of hidden documents while reporting in Iraq.
Material later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never proved Manning's source of information.
On Friday, Fein and Haziran were arrested in a military prison in Quantico, where he was held as a prisoner from 2010 to Nisan 2011, after a meeting with Manning.
Members asked Manning questions and noticed their papers.
When she asked about forms on Friday, Manning's guards said that the behaviour was "professional" and that all the opposite behaviors were "professional".
The forms don't make a complaint about misconduct, but the members of Manning's real issue of behavior, Fein says.
He said that Manning had expressed his concern about matters, and that the visiting members had spoken about them and said they would be directed to them, but that they did not record them.
Manning said, "It doesn't matter what they write, and it doesn't mean it doesn't speak."
Judge Judge Denise Lind de Manning asked him why he did not complain at the October 2011 meeting of Judge Denise Lind de Manning about the introductory remarks he had made months earlier.
He stated that his purpose at Manning's meeting was to "prevent" the situation.
The army said they had put him in a tight position with a six-step guard in order to protect himself and others.
"I wanted something to know that I was good and I wanted to get out of POI... to enjoy a quality of life that was more than my taste," said Manning.
Manning made a statement on the transfer to Kuveyt about two months before his arrest in Iraq and the transfer of the Marine Base Quantico military to Virginia in June 2010.
She said she was thinking about her pregnancy at Kuveyt and once she fell in love there because of the heat.
He said he'd be stressed that he'd be allowed to know what he's doing and what's out there.
"The world has moved to Camp Arafjon," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of his days in Quantico, at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours in a small cell.
Manning said that only one bed, Battalion, between fingers, some clothes and glasses were given.
He said he was trying to move because within the day, he said that it was wrong to follow and even stay away from rules.
Manning always said he was sleeping in the light outside his cell.
When the guards returned the night, they said they had woke him up and turned him back.
Manning's lawyer officially rejected Manning's actions in October 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in November 2011.
At the same time, a statement made by Judge Manning in his statement on Friday morning, asked about a night's sleep in Quantico's cell, a number of guards and other judges were forced to stand in front of him.
Manny said he wasn't given a chance to beat himself.
On Friday, the judge said that Manning had to take out a battalion from the guard's orders, but no one had ordered him to shoot.
Manning said he was forced to sleep the night before, because he had no chance of showing that he was not in danger of being in the memory of him.
Manning said he couldn't do it by using his internal memory bag or his fingerprints.
Manning said that night he was taken from his inner closet, his fingers between his fingers and his eyes.
The lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the trials he has experienced in prison and that he will greatly reduce his sentence in the military court waiting for the year before us.
The defense said Manning was planning to accept his crime in smaller cases and fight it in more extreme cases.
The case is scheduled to continue at the end of this week, and the prosecutors are expected to argue about the security of the situation.
The Pentagon Manning indicated that all of Quantico's maximum surveillance courts were held in accordance with the rules.
Including those who oppose Manning, help the enemy, why history was spread wrongly on the Internet, disclose national defence information, and steal public property or records.
If the trial takes place in all my estates, he can face the most terrible imprisonment.
Mexican American identity crisis
Many people say they're forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
The Mexicans are in pain training the divorced; they remind the Mexicans of difficult times, says
Navarret says the Mexican Americans are stuck between the two worlds.
I went to Mexico City on a short trip from the rest of the country, and I went to the migration area, and I was surprised.
The signs were showing two lines: one for "Mexico" ("Mexicoians") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("The Japanese")
I've been there for a few seconds. I'm not sure where I'm going.
I've been called "Mexico" all my life because I grew up in central California.
In this ethnic scene, my friends in Boston also call them "Irish" or my friends in New York say "Italian" to themselves.
Later I decided in Mexico America.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather didn't need a stone or a ladder in his country.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to handle both sides of a meeting in this language.
But I don't have their local words, and I can't save from my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and I passed the order for Extrajeros.
This week I thought of him when he visited White Saray to meet President Obama, the elected president of Mexico.
It's like I've always met the leaders of two countries in my day: the move, the drug and the trade.
Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth in the Mexican economy, which is why it is not possible to stay in Mexico until the Mexicans are trying to enter the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trading blog in the European Union in North America.
Pena Nieto has promised to continue to fight the drug cartels of Mexico if she doesn't suggest anything.
It's full of complex and unfeeling emotions about the United States for Mexico.
Most Americans probably never thought about the United States working in Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to take over half of their land.
But it's not a minute, it's a reminder for Mexicans who have been thinking for centuries everywhere.
That's why when an U.S. official said a little bit about Mexico, you'll start to hear complaints about Mexico's press and the elite's having a neighbor of the United States competency.
And Montezuma's children will go to war.
And yet, there are more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States, who are really violent for Mexico.
Do you want to talk about feelings of worthlessness?
There's too much.
There are people who have won and lost in Mexico who have created opportunities for the country and who have not.
The only reason for living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio from Mexico is that at one point in our family tree a person, perhaps a grandmother or a grandparent, has to stay out of time in Mexico and go north.
And most of the time, this person lives by a profile -- his feet, my less education, his poor village, vs.
We will provide for them and buy them.
Not Mexico.
And if we don't live in America now, we're going to good schools and we're never going to ignore the fact that what we live as good jobs is not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be uncertain, but our gift is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most Mexicans in the governing class do not love us.
That's how it feels.
They're looking at us as a reminder of a degrading innovation, and they're looking up at us as if we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relations with Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is entirely in their eyes.
Our families wouldn't have gone if they hadn't failed in Mexico.
And now we didn't find ourselves trapped behind the sandy horse, who live well in the United States, but still lose their souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is a difference between the Mexicans and the Mexicans as to who they are most likely to be and the Mexican Americans are not.
Despite being an U.S. citizen, he sees himself as part of the two countries.
At the same time, most of my friends don't feel like two Mexican Americans.
We both like to listen to Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springstein.
You're getting the best of both worlds, but you're not the source of any of them.
We're seen as Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are recognized as Mexican.
As I learned on my trip to further interfere with the relationship now, some Mexican leaders and some lighthouses want to re-connect with Diaspora.
Mexican Americans want to run as temporary "messengers" in Mexico to show their interest in the United States.
We have to force political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico by telling us what a beautiful country it is to visit Americans like us.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much of a feeling.
And we're not sure that most of us are a great country with inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence.
I'm afraid you guys are the only ones.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive for their behavior to Mexico a hundred years ago, then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they are still sorry about the behavior they have treated their family members more recently.
Hmm.
Maybe more than I thought, "We should be Mexicans."
Old wars, new Middle East
There may be an unlikely basis for a fire between Israel and Hamas.
Could there be a constant conflict between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood pressure shows that such a hope is empty.
Among the endless disputes that arose about whom he began, many turned to the building, and more than 140 Philistines and six Israel were killed as civilians, and the first time from Gazez came to the great city of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Kaddus.
But even though the Israelites and the Philistines seem to be busy in their earlier encounters, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arabians carried away pieces of silver into the air, and didn't like them; and the Philistines and the children of Israel carried them captive into the wilderness.
Maybe it makes them bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that this could corrupt their killers.
Not a war that has been won
At first glance, it seems very difficult to get the best out of it now.
Although the fires that were accepted on 21 November continued, this week's battle strengthened both sides of the battle.
Since 2007, Islamic leaders of Hamas, who have managed Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have been forced back by the Israelis, even though Gaza has been repatriated.
Although they killed some of their leaders and arrested 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the worst places in the world, they failed to destroy Israel Hamas.
Of course, Hamas the Philistine is currently winning a more central Palestinian fight in West Sheria by the giants of Fatah.
Besides, Hamas' leaders can take out the end of time.
Hamas had strong and rich friends as Muslims gained inspiration in the Arab world.
In one of Israel's most recent Muslim-dominated regional forces, Turkey was the target of Hamas, one of the richest and most dynamics of the Kurfese states.
The happy Hamas people of Islam say that a fraud has been directed by their army party around Israel from Lebanon to the north by Shizbullah, who has been sent to Syria by the Islamic trainer Pashhar Esad and who has threatened Hamas' king.
After all, the most prominent and important Arab countries in south-eastern Israel, under President Muhammad Mursi, have changed the high-level area of the Muslim brothers in Egypt.
There was very little time left for Hamas of Hüsni Mubarek, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011.
On the other hand, Brother Hamas's north and the leaders are more involved in the community.
The future diplomat can be identified as an actor not only by Hamas, Israel and America.
In the meantime, Israel's reporters will produce the opposite results.
Out of the army, he was put back in the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe's anti-flight system proved its value, and many of Hamas's remains were destroyed.
The Israelites will rest longer.
Diplomatically, the United States was so determined that most European countries accused Hamas of starting the last violence.
After all, Israel, particularly Israel, grew under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, who had never seen the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed nearly 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been able to escape a few of its major Israeli bombers who have moved to West Sheria, a major part of the Palestinian state and continue to expand their Jewish settlements despite international legal differences.
While the Likud party is being elected on 22 October, comfort Mr. Netanyahu, who is still with Avigdor Lieberman's side of the war team.
Why would you be upset when these false Philistines gave up their kingdoms?
If they really manage East Sheria, won't they shoot rockets like their transporters did at Gazze?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and take their heads off.
Maybe the reporters will win, but they can change Arab tomorrow's accounts.
If the Muslims were to gain power in Egypt and other places, they would not have loved Israel much, they would have been better able to fight against the oppression in their homes.
Israel's defence tower is larger than the Arab community's compound.
War on the ground with superpowers won't do much to improve the economy of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked with Barack Obama to provide a well-looking fire and maybe they could start something.
The Israelites must look into the distance.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the disappearance of the Palestinians from their rights of privacy this week creates a barbaric outbreak in areas under Israeli occupation, which is like a bus that this week in Tel Aviv.
In the Jewish state, pressure is already bluffing democracy, and the Arab spirit is growing.
Every few years, a diplomatic body will reach out against Gazze to turn Hamas.
There is a need for an external link on both sides
On both sides of the story, many of the outside world and the wise men in this paper are referred to as two states representing Israel's region for security.
In the short run, a small hope of fire will give the impression of a little more pressure to those who are trying to force foreigners.
Now, with Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, which must start to stop the flow of weapons to Gaza, it is better to accept the Jewish state's idea of land change and accepting Hamas as part of the border in 1967.
Foreign Arabs must also force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This will be more effective than the annual government offer at BM in connection with the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Mr. Obama is also playing a role in bringing Israel to the table.
For the first time, he prevented his own peace plan from coming to an end.
She seems reluctant to get into White Saray.
This pain doesn't go any further.
America's got a lifeboat in the Middle East.
This means a treaty between Israel and the Philistines.
Cigarettes just enter packing laws in Australia
Cigarettes and diseased organs are placed in green boxes only for all brands
Australia has introduced its first law on smoking and tobacco in the world, leaving brand logos and colors to the children and babies who are sick because of the use of tobacco by their bodies, as well as the use of tobacco by sick bodies.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the same small font names will be required on Friday, the only difference between packages will be required on the same day.
It's the toughest way to pack your tobacco in this world.
Australia's federal government says it's intention to quit smoking by cutting off young people from smoking.
This is based on studies that show that people don't start smoking at the age of 26, which show that they're never going to start with 99 percent.
"You can see that even children who are too young to marry know that they are trying to sell on the brands of all companies," for example, says Tanya Plibersak, a federal health officer who took advantage of efforts to show that children's fingerprints are linked to the idea of being princess.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and changes will have little impact on the lives of many nations, but other countries are considering similar measures.
They've done a lot of hard work against the laws of the whole industry.
He said that all companies would support the black market and that they would be able to access less and more affordable cigarettes.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said "There will be consequences that Yasama doesn't really want," he said.
Those from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products to sell in Australia's streets.
Others say it's increasing the work of the law.
From Zico Import Pty Ltd to Sandra Ha's cigarette boxes, a small family, two months ago, the silicon keys of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan broke off almost zero when they lost the law in the Supreme Court of Imperial Tobacco in England.
He says Zico has sold more than 6,000 to the top and is waiting for a new stock.
It's a good job for us.
The experts say that the potential increase is the population of social media in the demographic target of the plan.
A number of Australian laws have moved the whole market after they have legalized television advertising and sports sponsorship and many salesmen want to keep their cigarettes out of sight.
Australia has legalized local companies and websites online advertising, but it cannot limit overseas websites.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University, said, "If you're on the whole market and there's only this small window left to identify your products, it's a place where you need to be involved," he said.
Freeman's brands are increasing on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Did this really like Marlboro's cigarettes come into a civil lawyer's office and video making business, or is it a marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia said it was time for the industry to come up with new rules on trade.
Industry has made progress to pay for new regulations to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, which state that although no country in the World Ticaret Organization has a significant market with Australia, the trade has been unduly restricted.
A WTO decision is likely to take place in mid-2013.
Plybersak said the government has made talks with other countries that are considering packing decisions.
In 2001 it was Canada's first country to force photo alerts.
Now it has spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More laws are being enacted in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Most people in Australia are smoking.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm here to see them.
When Victor El Hage bought a package with a fingerprint, he said, "Take a cigarette and put it on."
If you need to be honest, there's only one reason I'm leaving, and she's a little girl.
In the center of Sydney, James Yu, who runs the entire king of Packets' shop, said that the only type of package that makes it difficult to block the tracks.
Yu said, "It took me an hour to empty one of my supplies, and now it takes me four hours."
He said, "The government had to rule everything. Then we said, 'Well, we're done. We're gonna close the store.'
It Is Wrong to Grieve in a Self - Sacrificing World
I spent five hours at the airport waiting for another flight when our plane was experiencing mechanical difficulties on this Saturday.
So it's been a long time to think about it.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Even if there's a lot of interesting things like books, stories, and iPhones waiting for a half-day flight in the airport (I don't even talk about shopping).
But later on, some academics and child development scientists are getting into trouble.
They say it's normal for us and our children to get involved sometimes.
He's forced his brain to go to interesting tanks, and maybe he's getting more creative.
And most of us can't see the benefits of being stuck together because we're connected to each other from a screen.
So we have to open the door to trouble?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to it.
First of all, I'm guessing that it's a new framework because it's like a lot of people who spend more time in the middle of nowhere.
Peter Toohey, who is professor of history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says that he is not.
He said, "There's actually a very long history of oppression."
There's a Latine wall letter from the first century about being stuck in Pompei's walls.
How do we know how to get stuck after all?
The problem is that this was identified and discussed in a variety of ways, says John D. Eastwood, a psychologist at the University of York, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and putting the idea before about 100 people in front of a room group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues identified it as a "system but not to be involved with satisfying activity".
He said the thing that separates the poor from the poor is that the man doesn't want to be busy, but he wants to be.
There's nothing to do with poverty, he said.
He said, "The heart attack is a break in the process of dealing with the sense of slowness and slowness."
It can be much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that they may be interested only in the problem of people who are tired of being around or around the world, but people who are depressed see it as their own.
Sometimes we think we're tired when we're just having to concentrate.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an ancient experience when participants listened to the record of a person who had read an article on the "Immediate Spirit: Impartial Recognition" that was published in the Psychological Science Review Report in July.
Some groups have heard a television program with no high voice and no interest in the room, others have heard it very little at a very low level, but the third group has never heard.
Those who heard mental-level television reported more stress than the other two groups, they lived with no concentration, but they were not sure why it was, and they were related to it.
One of the authors of the work and Mark J. Fenske, who taught me how to cope at Guelph University in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, it is difficult to break your interest.
On the other hand, when you're reading something complicated, it might help you not to concentrate on music from the street, like looking at bad cars in a factory band.
In fact, the transformation and transformation that is generally seen as a sign of difficulty can make people physically harder to deal with.
"It shows that children who are allowed to move are more likely to learn more than children who are forced to stay inactive and have received more information," said Professor Fenske.
We're all experiencing stress at some point, flying late, a monotonous talker, a heavy movie.
But some people think I'm more likely to get into trouble than others.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a "Difficulty Age Size" to help measure this.
It contains questions like, "I have too much interest, I don't have time to do anything."
Professor of Psychology at West Florida University, Stephen Vodanovich, found that researchers using such measurements have found that men are more likely to get more and more out of touch than girls.
But they're usually a very poor group when they're tired.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson, professor of human and population development at the University of Illinois, made an attempt to communicate seven times a day by means of nearly 400 calls and calls to his colleagues.
He found that 32 percent of adults were pregnant when they were in school and paying their bills, but 23 percent were pregnant when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, they said that 3 percent of the widows were pregnant.
Professor Larson said 21 years later that he didn't know if there would be a higher percentage of stress.
But he said he knew that what children and the poor wanted to do was "the cycle of pregnancy" because they were not given more control over what they wanted to do to the poor.
So I'm going back to the first question: Is it good for a man to get hurt?
Sometimes no, because research shows that as a means of reducing people's exposure to physical risks, gambling or drug abuse.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has worked more than two ways on the subject, argues about the link between the complexity and creativity of many philosophers and writers.
Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the U.S., said, "It's a way of telling you that your brain needs to do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know what's best to do.
If you get stuck and use this energy to play guitar and eat, it will make you happy.
But if you watch television, it can make you happy in a short time, but it won't last long.
So if you give him an iPad when your child gets pregnant, he can't get pregnant anymore, but he doesn't know how to have fun or how to fix himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "It's going to be transferred from one situation to another,"
Your child will not only learn to enjoy himself but also control himself more in other areas.
I don't think we're really gonna want to be so happy.
And we shouldn't be too aggressive.
Rather, our goal should be to stay away from gambling and technology.
Professor Eastwood was involved.
He said, "We need more stress, but it's a pain in the ass, and it wants to be connected to something that doesn't make sense," he said.
He said, “What people are asking for is a way of getting out of business and enjoying leisure time.”
He said, "It's hard to find ways to be busy when there's a sound in a neighborhood where we're being warned."
There is no script for the New Marihuana Act in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, South Colorado University student and football player for a crime against something that's about to happen on the ground: a couple of pieces of marijuana and a pipe to drink.
One day in July, Mr. Orozco said he and his friends stopped while driving near the Kansas border in Lamar.
After the police found Marihuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a call for a small crime, transport and drug machine with a 100-dollar fine, and a court record was given.
"We were treated as a criminal," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he?
For Colorado's purpose of entertainment, the little majority of marijuana law enforcement is largely dependent on the answer of hundreds of young drug addicts in the uncertain weeks.
Hundreds of minor criminal marijuana cases are already closed in Washington, D.C., where a similar lawyer has been approved.
Police units have left the charge for the small-scale transport that is legally approved by law in the weeks before us.
However, prosecutors in more occupied areas in Colorado have sworn to carry out their cases firmly and still call on people to be brought to court for reasons of transport.
At the same time, several towns from the Denver bays to the East Mountains are used to prevent the opening of Marihuana shops in the areas of the new state.
Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora's in the east of Denver, said, "This thing's growing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen later," he said.
And the editors in Washington State are cutting their heads.
And they're looking for a license system for production, distribution and sale on 1st of April 2013.
They're saying that Colorado is in front of most of the state with regard to menopause.
Speaking about the U.S. Department of Internal Control, Brian E. Smith said, "Corado will have a more regular market and will therefore be a good guide," he said.
But he went on to say that no place or system could do more than suggest what would work.
"There is no real example to follow," he said.
Washington's law called I-502 will enter into force on 6 May and will leave a year of uncertainty as to whether the state's license system is no longer available, but will leave a year of uncertainty about the legal transfer.
During this period, there are serious mechanical issues to be addressed, such as how state schools, parks, children's parks or children's care centres will be able to apply the "adequate access" directive to the licensed Marihuana with restrictions on the use of care centres.
Ben Livingston, the newly-established research group Legal Engineering Center, said "It's no longer difficult to find a licensed management operation anywhere, especially a large city area with Seattle."
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to the members of Aurora that the city's 21-year-old lawyer would not charge anyone with little marijuana and that the police would stop people from committing these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would lay down the laws of the city that would order medical marijuana growers and follow up drug dealers and sellers again.
Ken Buck, head of the region in the Weld region of North Colorado, represents a much larger meeting.
After the vote, the office said it would continue to monitor the cases of marijuana as a way to force users to stay out of treatment.
There are now 119 people who are accused of carrying two or less nasals or marijuana against many other charges.
In a statement, Mr. Buck said, "When our officers are alive, they have the duty to bring charges against those who are guilty."
There has even been a crisis in places like the Red Sea, where the moons denied entry into the Marihuana.
The biggest city in the region is now the police in Grand Junction no longer charge adults for small numbers.
The district head of the region, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision but decided not to close the transport cases pending at the same time.
He said, "I don't think I've wasted my time by continuing to apply the law until it's changed,"
Although 55 percent of those who voted in Colorado would never have been able to bring pleasure-oriented marijuana into the government and the legal system.
And the controversial attitudes that are common in the empire lead to a deep doubt between local authorities about the country's major green trial.
Marihuana's lawyer and Marihuana's Law Reform Reform National Organization, representing the defenders, says Sean McAllister is "a cultural divider" with local leaders.
He said, "They have spent a lot of their lives accusing people of committing crimes, so they do not recognize that this is legal."
They are ready to be national testing teams for drug law enforcement in Colorado and Washington, as the first countries that have been treated as alcohol to marijuana in small quantities.
While lawyers and government officials are planning a new border for legal sales, they are waiting to be approached by a federal government that plans to close the sale and production of marijuana in a manner that is concerned.
The law-enforced marijuana lawyers expect the Court of Justice to be withdrawn.
Despite the high profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has generally allowed medical marijuana operations in Colorado, Washington and other 16 regions.
Kevin A. Sabet, speaking about the old drug policy in Obama's administration, said that drug agents would probably not lock the doors to catch a small drug bag but would probably stop them from allowing the entertainment industry that the new legislation allows.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments have accepted the debt payments of new marijuana shops, which are about a year away, to open up some local governments.
He brought a six-month law to the city of Montrose, in the west of the last week, and probably the week before us.
The City Council member Bob Nicholson said, "We don't want to be brought into a state where this is a major federal problem,"
He used to vote against the change in our area.
We're watching you play against the state.
There's too many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was fired from Oxford because I was a spy
Today's students can't just get attacked because of their encounters.
I don't remember when I didn't imagine winning a place at Oxford University.
My father and my great brother were both in a place where the world's best-educated modern wine cellar was found in the Greek symposium where the culture was free of thought and tolerance.
But in the two weeks I took my place at the Worcester College to read history at the end of the sexes, I started my first life scandal.
My father was tired and crying.
His friends are surprised.
At the standard room next to me, his house said I was separated from my friends because I was having sex.
Writer A. N. Wilson heard I broke up because I was forced to drink out of a broken financier.
It's a little less commission.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away 'cause I stood up against systematic sales and fear.
Not because I'm a little weird or because I'm from a private school.
I've only been sentenced for one reason, and in the fifth part of this explanation, this was also a big barbaric one: my father, my cousin Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher was a highly professional speaker, and I supported the Speakers.
You can ask why I opened this up.
According to recent reports, new generation-based right-wing students are getting out of similar trials.
In Oxford, there was a protest against the dissident students, and then they were so hated that last week a group of homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities claimed the same rights.
Corpus Christi College's third-class joint room (JCR) claimed that because of political meetings, "they were often left active only because they were attacked personally and felt that they did not want to."
They want to create a publication in the same committee of opportunity of the university so that its meetings can be made available free of charge.
The new BBC Two documentary Wonderland also did not help: Young, Parlak and Right Talkers on Student Policy appeared strange and neo-Nazi.
The post by the former head of the OUCA, Oxford University, presented Joe Cooke with Rolls-Royce, who was known as the head of the audience as a gold team dress and a gold head.
In other universities, colleges say they're treated as "stupid killer" for higher education fees.
Luke Black, 20, Nottingham University, told a U.S. chief assistant in the market newspaper "is a left-wing gap in universities."
"Before they meet us, people think we're like Bullingdon Club."
Historic scholar Samuel Roberts, in Corpus Christi for better protection, says that such an environment is "not calm," but Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA's elected president, says that it is a violation of the rights of right-wing JCR members.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere and to the peace of the members," he says.
I was the only person in Oxford in the first few weeks.
In 1986, at 18 years of age, I went on my way as an unsatisfied passenger.
It was the hottest time of the debate against the party.
A year ago, former scholar Margaret Thatcher voted to refuse the honor of paying higher education fees at the university.
This atmosphere terrorized a Stalin's side.
In the first few days of the first few weeks of the week when the students were socializing with each other and with their educational responsibilities, I saw the pain I was about to experience.
I'd have seen the teacher's duties come down to the corner before I could see that he'd come to see that he's doing his homework.
I was brought to the grass-roots panelrooms of political education in dialogue against the various South Africa regimes, specializations and government.
The first 18th century was about translating French texts into English, and then I wasn't ready for those who came.
"Mr. Wyatt, please turn the first paragraph," said teacher Harry Pitt.
That's what I've been doing.
It was Pitt's passion, a little man like a pasta smell.
He said, "Is it the French people who refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?"
The other students were fired.
His eyes hurt my back.
"I suggest you take basic French courses, if you're not very involved in socializing," Pitt said.
I walked back to my room with a tear picture.
That night at the university, I sat alone on my own at dinner, and then I felt a slight touch in my shoulder.
This was a second-class English student named James, known as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said.
I'm afraid so.
He's dealing with anyone who's suspected of being an informer.
That's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most reporters behave as if the first grade student's party is wrong.
And then, in a local bar, I tried to make a terrible dance.
I insisted on not participating in anything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This has proved tactical failure.
A first-class PPE student found in Eton in an ironic way said, "You're a fascist doll girl,"
You're in.
The other students kept themselves.
I was wrong, I was wrong.
Someone asked, "How are the talkers doing sex?"
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt as if the sexes would have felt before the liberal laws of the sexes.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people with the same idea only when I was in the dark?
Would I go back to my work party and print my natural training?
He's been walking like a lonely bear for three years.
The only open debateer at my university was Professor Norman Stone, professor of Modern History.
He was also hated for being one of those foreign political speakers and text writers.
He wasn't there very much.
He was being driven from there because he was small and far away and because he was tied to a historic meeting needed by Marksist.
In 1997, Ankara began its career at the University of Bilkent in Turkey.
He said to me, "You're not gonna be happy there,"
From Oxford, I started going to London's home, where I found my friends and my family, who were more clearly in sight.
I told my dad I hated Oxford, and I told him why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political meetings were being held in the streets during his own time.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They won't do it. They won't be among my ghosts.
Even my Communist friends always had perfect behavior.
It's getting darker.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure all of this is a joke.
If you split up, my heart's broken.
My emotional resilience from my frequent visits to London was weakening.
A man in charge of my friend's job gave up his faith and refused.
I decided to do the same when I told myself that I was a "people's enemy" in the course of the next week.
I was embarrassed to admit that my brain's weakened by my experiences, and I called them "old idiots."
The interrogation was short.
My dad got my chair at Oxford's career table.
Then every week Murdoch wrote two letters.
My door was locked.
I was in there, and five minutes later those who followed me fell asleep.
When they left, I prepared a doll and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a broken ass.
But no one at the age of 18 should be so scared and excited about any kind of education.
Even more tragic is that Oxford's release of 14 defendants and the same equality and freedom of thought as it has not yet been achieved.
Fill in the missing two persons in Trabzon
Trabzon dropped second rate due to the right-wing rain that had taken effect on Yomra.
And when the two women that had been slain in the wilderness of Sivan perished, the way of the wilderness of Sivan was closed.
One of the two women who lost their cell was found dead.
The rain was active in Yomra's high-end 15-00 hours.
By the time the second level was moved, the second village was located in the water about 200 metres from the road connected to the Sayan Valley.
Abraham Karsley, one of the villagers who was close to working on the road to inform the authorities, said, "The road is 3 hours close.
We live the same thing in every violent rain.
We told the authorities, but you didn't come, you didn't go.
The fellows are losing their lives.
We live this stress every year.
When the trees reach their level, the water goes out."
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
Omra said to the father of the child Abraham: "The one of the two women who were lost in the cave on the right side of the cave, one of the two women who had been lost in the field, and the other of the women who had been killed, who kept on trying to call the other.
He remembered that the left hand was alive because of the right hand of the sun, which was active in the year, and that the two women, who had gathered in the valley of Tashkelon, were trapped in the green waters.
The South African, who said that their call work had been resumed in the early mornings, said, "The work of the Belgian machines has reached the body of one of our fellow citizens under the soil, and they continue to call the other."
He added that the Red, the missing person was quietly carrying out the work on closed roads, indicating that the rain had dropped and left him in the sun.
The missing women were told that the road to the town was open while they were working on the search.
"I CAN'T TELL YOU UP"
Trabzon's Yomra-like village is trying to cover the wounds of the yellow and yellow influence that comes from the right end of the soil.
He said, "It's not like the rain was raining."
"We have left the collection.
And then there was a disaster like this.
The missing woman and the pregnant woman were gathering during the rainy season.
They were arrested when they returned to their homes."
The rock adds that the electricity is short and that the water is not washed.
Hasan Selim used the phrase "If the rain continued for an hour, there would be no stone on the stone," pointing out he was 60 years old.
The College of Nature is paying off!
The College of Nature provides students with 100 percent of the BSE's success.
In an understanding of education for young people and visas, Douga College, which has won global education models for Turkey and the world, supports successful students with a four-year scholarship of 100 per cent in the Donga Anadolu Schools, which is being implemented by the T-MBA Education Model.
Only students with T-MBA, a high-licensing program, which is applied at the Schools of the Doga College of Anadolu, start working in higher schools, and start in college and life.
Douga College, who has been in high school in SBS for the past three years, offers satisfaction and supports education with the bus opportunities that it has given students.
The four-year-long exchanges in the Donga Anadol Schools that the T-MBA school model is applied vary from 5% to 100%, according to the student's success.
In the OYP, the Donga College, which pays 491 to over 100 burs, represents the 50% to students who pay between 481-490, 471-480 to students who pay to pay 60 and 451-470.
The College of Nature, between 321 and 450 OYP points to promote student success, is awarded by bus in areas ranging from 5% to 40%.
Turkey's most successful students prefer t-MBA.
As a result of their success in SBS, Turkey's most successful students from many schools prefer the T-MBA education model that has won to Turkey and the world through the understanding of the New York College of Youth and Visionary Education.
The high-licensing program for students with T-MBA, which is only applied at the Schools of the Doga College of Anadolu, begins in the course of higher education, and begins in college and in life.
The university's high-licensing programmes are presented in the T-MBA Education Model for students, Students' Schools, T-MBA Applications, Foreign Language, International Projects, Association of Disciplines and Associations of Education and Social Affairs.
Nature's winding possibilities are also passed on in Oxford's conceptual camps...
The opportunities of the Oxford Quality School to develop with the cooperation of the College of Nature in the first year of the SBS Turkish Championship also vary from 2% to 75% in the fields where Oxford's conceptual education model is applied.
Between 481-490 and 490 OYP points, % of the students in the Doga College who are awarded a prize of 471-480 will provide a 50 % scholarship for students in the field between 60 and 451-470.
"The investment we made to our students is the investment made in Turkey's future."
The bottom line of their pride with their students is that of Donga College CEO, which is about the success of the competition, "The College aims not only to academically, but to produce offspring that will succeed in every field of life.
To this end, we're focusing our students on getting better and better results by paying them all their sports, art, and music.
As teachers, we know that each student is a different field.
The most important thing is to get out of their lives and let them know what they can do, and let them know how much they can do to help them.
Our students' education is based on the knowledge that our investment in Turkey's future is going to be, and we reward their every success."
It's always good to win
Immi Davala said they left a hard game behind. "The 3 points are not easy, but it's a joy to win."
G.Saray said from Assistant coach Umit Davala, the start of the season with the Gaziantpsport library.
They bought two cups before the new season, and they lived hard in some sections of the Gaziantpsport, and they recorded that they had a comfortable football in the game, "It's always good to win.
It's an active group of Gaziantpspors, but everything we've found is easy for us."
BURSA MACHI KOLAY OLMAZ
Davala, who added, "We now have a strong bussasport deposit.
The games aren't easy to win.
We don't see any cracks in the bag as we're called, and the magazine-psport game is proof of that."
How does someone be counted worthy of the month
I'm going to try to give you a lot of support and experience in solving the problems you're facing in the social security field, or what you're interested in.
Our readers need to write down hundreds of messages in social security and working life.
From this, I'll give you the most accurate, healthy and reliable news on Hurriet and Hurriet.com.tr.
First of all, I want to get the file of the property that's very loud in the neighborhood.
We'll take these letters that are going to continue as part of the written order.
In our letter you can find answers to all questions about property.
You can send your questions to alippet@hurriyet.com.tr address which you do not find and which you are particularly interested in.
I'm gonna be in a hurry to answer you in the shortest time.
What's the problem?
MALLULEN is able to recover from the early recognition of the safety requirements of the SSK and of the SGK's insurance policy by registering the safety conditions listed in the SGK's legislation that are likely to result in the loss of employment at least 60 years of age.
Those who work in the community are likely to be better able to gain power in the community as long as they are unable to carry out their duties apart from those who are assigned to them.
Who are they?
I'm writing from the diyarbakur, my name is Mehmet Gültekin. I have 920 days insurance. I have 540 days military insurance. I have 1460 days insurance.
Besides, I'm a kidney patient.
I'm connected to the diesel engine.
I'm still working on a job.
Can I have a full month?
- Welcome, Mr. President.
You did not specify the first time you entered a job.
However, let us briefly explain how the full moon will be brought into contact with you.
First of all, the most important of the conditions laid down in the law must be insurance for 10 years and you must be a total press day of 1800.
In addition, you are considered to be rich when you are diagnosed with at least 60 percent loss of your working or work force or the result of a case-of-the-art disease.
However, you're here because you're dialysed here, you're providing 60 percent of the conditions because you don't meet the 1,800 prime day number.
Of course we don't know how many years you've been working.
The day you completed your 10-year-old and 1800-year-old work together will be connected to you as you register or apply the SGK.
Privileges of Gaining the Privilege of the Property Month
Can't no one be pregnant for 10 years, without the 1800s?
- The first payment order must be completed in 1800.
However, there is only one exception; it is also related to the fact that those who are determined to be in constant care of someone else are entitled to a minimum of 10 years of insurance.
What diseases or disorders will be changed in the future sections of our letter on the regular presence of people with disabilities.
Status of people who have stopped working
I'm Ahmet Güler.
They told me that while I was carrying all the stuff I owned under the law of the SGK, you couldn't get a full month because I was sick for the first time.
I'm too heavy.
Isn't that unfair?
How am I supposed to be pregnant?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written that you've healed all the tumors found in the Law, but there's no need to exist before the disease that is based on the loss of work for the SSK and the Allied Insurance.
Because you're not moving this condition, it can't be connected to the full moon.
However, you may be pregnant when you have the emergency conditions when you are under the age of insurance.
- I have 3980 days, and I'm 16 years old.
I've been identified by the SGK before I'm on my way to work.
They said, "You will not be my heir."
What am I gonna do in this situation?
I'm not gonna be busy.
Can you show me the way?
- Yeah, you're right.
You can't be rich.
But the SGK law also has a prescription for pregnancy.
So there are two cases before and after October 2008.
If you started working for the first time in this history, you can get a half-age month with at least 15 years of insurance and 3600 primary days.
That's why we recommend you to be in charge of a monthly connection in accordance with one of the nearest SGK Managers.
Well, if you'd been working after the 2008 team, then you could have been on insurance for at least 15 years and you could have been on the condition that you've been on insurance for at least 3960 days of age, old age and death insurance.
You need to get out of work when you start?
I'm still working as a driver on a job.
When I went to the hospital, I was diagnosed with cancer.
I want you to be careful.
Do I have to get out of this situation?
Can't I go on a full moon without a break?
I don't want to be out of work until it's over.
- You're right.
You need to be out of work to give you the connection request.
However, you need to be counted as a member of the SGK's law before the month is observed.
However, if you are rich, you are bound to a month with other conditions.
There's no point in giving a monthly connection request without an invoice. You're at risk of being unemployed.
That's enough for you 1800 days.
When you go to SGK and give me a request for my property, the SGK will love one of the patients you've grown up in.
And when you bring your health institution report (on cancer) to the SGK, the SGK will evaluate this report at its own health institution and decide that your cancer is affecting your work force over 60 percent.
However, if you have to complete the 10-year insurance period so that your month will be connected, you will be able to contact the month if you have to complete the ten-year insurance period.
So as soon as we can say this, it's not wise for those who work on insurance to implement the SGK health system before they see the decision "You're free of charge".
But if non-workable insurance companies are going to give up all the conditions, they may require that the SGK and the property status be established and linked at the same time.
This may be useful if it's rich and if it's going to give up the other conditions.
Will the Qur'an be fulfilled in full?
I'm a federal security officer.
I'm leaving all the conditions.
But they said, "You will not be responsible for your debt."
What am I supposed to do?
- I'm reading it.
Whoever told you was right.
You didn't write down what other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's the law that you pay your primary debt 4/b.
But I can give you a special tea.
I advise you to pay your debt to banks or similar institutions so that they can bond you.
As soon as the moon is connected, it takes more months and you'll pay for it in advance.
It'll be easy for you to owe them because they quit your month.
According to which status is the property month associated?
I've worked as an SSK and the All-Kur and the Emkley.
When I'm due for the moon, how will the moon be connected to me?
- If you work in more than one state as a valuable student, a member, or an associate, you are the last to become a security officer, so if you are the last to leave a secure place as an SSK, you will take a month from the SSK by registering other conditions.
SGK is a valid hospital report
How's the property management done?
Which hospitals can I get a health report?
- It's enough that you're involved in health-related reports to the annual social security administrations or social security centres.
The SGK will love you in health care education and research hospitals, in universities (except private universities and private hospitals), in Turkish Armed Forces military hospitals.
However, in the absence of these patients in the year that you are advanced, there may be loving treatment in the very complex hospitals of the Health Watch.
It's not possible to fall in love with a private hospital?
- There's only possible conditions.
The love of people who are asleep and who are at risk of their lives in the old system will now be able to agree with the new management of their hospital, with the SGK on 01.09.2013 as soon as they are able to enter into the hospital, they will be able to be treated and admitted to another hospital where they are at risk, and the health reports you have received here will also be considered valid.
What are the conditions for love operations?
The insurance requirement of the SEVK is sufficient to provide a minimum of 1800 days of premiums for the treatment of love related to insurance.
He's going to pay hospital charges for the property facility by the SGK.
And it won't take 10 years for insurance.
In the case of the connection of the asset month, if the asset is at a dangerous level, the security period of 10 years between insurance conditions is only 1800 days and the month is linked to the health institution report.
That's why when a person first comes to the property clinic, he's only going to the real estate clinic, looking at the risk of being a real asset.
Nargile Operation
Nargile started auditing for laws that began to apply to coffee.
The last week's tests had to stop the sale of many commercial drugs.
Zabėta began to organize an operation with the public access to coffee in Narrique, Istanbul.
There was a stop to the sale of cigarettes to non-authorized operators with operations performed in coffee shops in the area.
In almost all cases, the first time the money will be cut off from employees who continue to sell the kidney when the whole kidney is affected by tests.
If the sale continues, the transactions will be closed and closed.
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
The TAPDK (TAPDK) was published last month in the month of February, "The Specials About the Use of This Land" by the Ait Field/Fields Document of Contact.
It was known for five months that Nargile coffee was transported at least 200 metres from schools.
And we're also required to use drugs in closed areas.
The first day of the operation, which was not in line with the probationary, began with the divorce of Pejiktaš.
In Bebek, the most popular places in Istanbul, Al Facer, Ikram Nargile Kafe and Mis Nargile Kafe were also forced to stop their sales of many narrators that were not allowed.
The punishments start from 23
In the meantime, there will be 23 000 fines from TL in the case of the continued sale of drugs by unauthorized sites.
The places where the money is punished three times will be dismissed.
According to the figures, there are currently about five employees in Istanbul who have access to coffee.
Vendor Specific Warning
TAPDK, in the 27th of December, made it necessary for the employees to make the kidney fats 'response'. According to the report, the health warnings were either in the form of kidney fat or in the form of a conical form.
Warnings are applied in a way that starts with the oral section of the bottles.
White, red, grey and black can be used to print health warnings.
There's a lot of warnings in the coffee shop right now.
Critical warning to families from security
The Security Department warns families about activities organized under the name "green camp" to gather by non-legislative bodies.
The terrorist control teams, the 17-year-old history leader of the DHKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKIP, and some of the legal structures of the TKIP, have put together the new plan of the agencies that have been involved in the course of the journey.
To gather across terrorist agencies, he warned families about the security forces that, under the name of the "green camp" of the "big camp", the security forces that identified the camps, and that children were sent to these camps.
The terrorist police, who found out that the terrorist agencies were planning to organize 41 camps in various ways, asked them to send their children to these camps while they were with their families.
The 350 families refused to send their children to camp
The terrorist police, in particular DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP, warned against the activities that terrorist agencies, such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP, have intended to gain young people in the organization.
The 350 families who took note of the police's warnings refused to send their children to camps.
After the police warnings, 41 camp 14 planned to reorganize the bodies were canceled.
Terrorist organizations have conducted 20 campaigns to reduce my participation.
The security forces indicated that two camps were still on, and five camps were scheduled to be organised in the coming days.
The Security Department also sent a letter of notice on these camps to all age groups.
Young People Ask...
20 camps carried out by terrorist organizations were held in Izmir, Kocaeli, Fisheries, Chanakakle, Nigde, Eski city, Bursa, Bartín, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay, and were destroyed by Army, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartín, Izmir, Bolu and Adana camps.
According to security reports, these camps are mostly attended by young people who have won the university.
Non-legislative bodies are winning in the body by promoting their campaigns in the camps.
In these camps, young people who are newly enrolled in the organization are also being given formal education, and young people are becoming more closely associated with the organization.
In these fields under the written camp view, education is given in matters such as "how actions can be transformed into violence."
Message that will be signed after half the time
Dennis Komsa found his owner in the U.S. New Jersey State 50 years ago.
Cam whiskey came out of a house around the house after Sandy Karrgasie, who last year we were in the United States.
"Please answer the questions below and send them to the following address.
This is a scientific research by Dennis Komsa (12)," he writes.
In writing, the person who found the bottle wants to tell you where, when, and how you found it.
He's also taking a little money in the winter to pay for a war and mail.
The date of August 16, 1963, which was about 30 miles [35 km] away from the ocean in New Jersey, was given to the owner on our last day.
Komsa, about half a century old in 1963, said, "I was surprised to see what you threw into the ocean, thinking you'd find it, but I never imagined you'd come back to me."
Loves sound frequencies
He told me what can be done with the sound frequencies of South Pamir from the first speakers in Turkey, and I was surprised.
According to sound technologies or sound engineering, sound systems are likely to come to everyone's mind with music-related sound systems.
And did you know that with sound technologies, terrorism could be prevented, that at the moment, it could be executed without a cause, that you could love someone you wanted, that you could recognize a secret, or that you could bring it back to the world's rate?
After graduating from the University of Balkent, South Pamir received a degree in sound engineering from the SAE College in England and mastered sound technologies at the Middlesex University.
The communication technology established at Galatasaray also develops sound engineers at the ITM Academy of Music and provides courses such as music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and further recording techniques.
Sublimal message of terrorism
"What sound technology is that?" is the first question.
"A technology that can be used in many areas of the world.
Our brain's all occupied with electrical brains.
The sound frequency is also a kind of electric current, it's energy.
You can change people's minds by using this energy and you can make them move by whatever order you want."
One of the most important sub-items of sound technology is the sub-liminal message.
In music or song, a message is placed on a frequency outside the person's source line, which is not identified by the above memory but goes down to the bottom.
For example, when a terrorist attack is reported, it's because Pamir tells us that a music release can be made in that area.
If a message such as "Do Not Take This Attack" has been changed to the frequency of the published song, it will be picked up by terrorists.
He doesn't understand what he's hearing, but his under-arms take it and a sound comes out of him like "Don't do."
And he sees it as a message from Allah.
But in the world and Turkey, there are certainly laws and penalties for the use of such messages outside public security.
The South Pamir is a subliminal message prepared for students at a conference at the Istanbul Technical University.
"In the course of the conference, I gave a musical talk to the students.
I put in the music a frequency called 'Su'.
At the end of the interview, I asked the students not to do it.
They say they're all too tired in a strange way."
According to Pamir, there are those who use subliminal messages as escape, "Some radio channels have been detected in our country, but the details are not yet known.
There's a channel called "Kara Sound Radio" in Germany, a frequency for radical Islamists.
There are messages that have been attacked by subliminal means, which are religion-intensive, which are called for war, and which order drug use.
German police and Turkish police know this, but it can't happen because they're constantly changing frequencies."
And these dangerous messages were also used in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these ideas, there was no terrorist on the planes entering the tunnels, and sub-liminal orders were carried out by direct direct pilots.
Desktop
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
This knowledge is especially used in the U.S. banks.
For example, when the police are on the phone with the police officer, they can determine which room the voice person on the phone is in, where the bank is.
A sound is different from that of metal, plate, plastic, wall or any other material.
It's also possible to determine the size of the room, according to the shape of the sound, even the shape of the room, and how many sides it has.
As a result, it is possible to determine what kind of items the offender has, what size he is in a room.
There was also a computer program used to do this that Pamir even designed an opera building from Tararistan, "I thought it would be possible to provide the perfect sound level where 175 hopper buildings are located.
It's not a cheap technology, it's worth $4-5 billion."
The sound frequency is also used in the mima and decoration.
Pamir's got a lot of work to do on this.
For example, at a restaurant where people go to work, where they meet at a high-level event, they make a rule that doesn't go outside the table.
Only those on the table can hear what they're talking about.
Two steps ago, someone else doesn't hear anything on the table.
And the general system of these kinds of systems is: "If you want one sound to be lost, you hit it with another sound in the same frequency of your own molecular structure, and you turn it into a volume that destroys the existing sound energy.
No one's gonna fly unless this system's gone.
Because the sound of airplanes is so high that they cannot be controlled.
They're hitting each other on the plane. They're gonna destroy themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a peaceful environment far from being in your home."
Was it made with the sound of the pyramids?
There are other interesting things that Pamir, one of Turkey's first vocalists, did.
For example, he arranged for an open air disk in Ajvalyk to not hear music out of the air.
The sound can't be overwritten, compared to another frequency of sound.
If you want, even in a room you can make a certain line without voice.
He's brought up the sports hall and the sport and the concert.
I mean, it's two-use.
Because when you play basketball, you need to be warm, but you need to be warm at concerts.
It's with all the sound technologies that can only be heard by music in the open-ended concerts.
"We use the frequency to destroy the sounds that are heard as loud and to correct the noise of the person, to make the music more pure.
MTV is very forward in this regard.
He edits open-hearted concerts and sounds like a studio record."
That's what Tubitak's been trying to do.
It separates the flow of two aluminium into one another with its frequency of sound.
There were scientists who claimed that the pyramids of Egypt were made with sound.
They thought the stones could be removed by sound and located.
I'm asking, "Is it not easy to use bad intentions?"
"When I read the works of York University from the Internet, I was so scared that others could read them.
Because even if the writers are good-willed people, they can cause incredible consequences."
"Responsive of Prayer With Arabic"
Süden Pamir, who said that his speech would affect us if we were human, explains why: "For all the sounds that you hear are brains.
The real person only hears the sound of concentration, but the other sounds are actually causing the brain and leads to weakness.
That's why it's best to walk on the ground, walk around the ground, take your natural steps.
I think it's necessary to make arrangements to get you involved in school.
So the student only concentrates on the teacher's voice and can provide longer concentration."
Pamir, who said that he believed that his prayers would be effective if he read from Arabic because of the characteristics of his voice frequencies, notes that he had a very rich frequency horizon, and that when the sounds in his words came to the side, he noticed that many positive effects would be left behind.
He says, "But I have to read the prayers aloud.
Frequent love rate
The question is, "Is it possible to love someone with their frequency?"
If the rate of frequency is not what Pamir has given, and the frequency is to move the feelings of the more right person, then say: "You must find the frequency of pressure you use when you talk about it first.
You can activate it by using a higher frequency in this frequency.
Let's think that the guy's pressure rate is 300.
And you want to play a music that's life-changing when you're with him.
If you're going to play this 300-frequency music, you're going to get the power of those who have to break out of the frequency you're going to play, and you're going to make it more powerful.
Maybe that's how it's possible to love someone who's in front of you."
Pamir, who also spoke about special sound systems for the world's politicians to speak more effectively, can feel as if a political artist is a wonderful creature of nature when the bass sounds are planned.
"The voice of truth that is believed to be sounded by Michael on the Day of Resurrection in Japan is now being sounded in Japan, and how is this going to happen to you?" said Pamir, "I think the human voice is close because the most powerful human voice is near its own voice.
What an excellent example for man! It is as if he were created out of the soul of man.
'It'll raise gold prices'
Jannings Capital Inc., Canada, said, "The gold will continue to play a role in being a safe tool of design."
In the first half of the year of global demand for the most profitable investment vehicle last week, Hrushewsky, China and India, who were in the evaluations of the price-related high-cost AA guest, said, "The demand for gold from China raises India as a matter of fact and Chinese investors play a major role in this."
I remember that India is the largest gold buyer in the past, and Hrushewsky says, "I believe that the government's efforts to manage debt accounts restricting the gold supply are no longer very controversial.
People will find a way to this table," he used his words.
Hrushewsky advised investors to make long-term investments, "The gold will continue to serve as a safe tool of design.
Many Western governments forget the high levels of debt from the 'diversity of discipline'.
Governments are struggling to reduce debt by lowering the value of money units.
That's why the gold prices will be higher than their current levels."
"In the long run, gold is saving a good deal in reducing the risk of trade"
While World Gold Board Investment Board General Manager Marcus Grubb, who is more complex and reliable in financial markets, states that it is only a physical entity that seeks to ensure that its properties are more complex and reliable, "if gold falls in the long term, it is good to record its progress in terms of its ability to reduce its market risks.
The gold portfolios of small quantities, showing that the demand for imports has grown, have usually proved to be much more stable and better when dealing with market uncertainty."
Grubb, who pointed out that the demand for gold has been rising in the last 10 years, "The gold represented less than 1 percent of the total world investment.
This means that market opportunities are still very important for growth in gold investment.
In this cycle, 78 percent of the gold and steel inputs made over the past year are evidence that the investment interests are protected."
"In India, national gold stocks must be increased to support economic growth"
The world's largest gold market in India and China, Grubb, which has also raised the issue of governance for India and China, has raised the demand for gold, gold, and silk in the second round of the year of the fall in gold prices.
Grubb recalled that during his speech, 54 percent of China's demand for gold was higher than 51 percent in India.
Grubb, who said, "The Chinese demand for Mücevher was generally silent in the second half of the time.
After the price of gold suddenly fell down on Nisan, the demand grew high, and the grain was quickly broken to pieces."
Grubb, in India, pointed out that the government has taken a lot of steps to support the downturn of the Central Bank of India and to reduce its current output, "In the nature of the demand for gold, it may be as difficult to carry out restrictive applications at the level of its base, and that is why it can also meet with inadequate channels.
He believes that the World Golden Council should view India's policies as a strategic investment.
In addition, it was found in their evaluations that national gold stocks should be increased to support economic growth in line with long-term policy objectives."
Global Golden Trends
In the second round of this year's global gold demand for 856.3 tons of gold, global interest and foreign gold investments were reported by the World Gold Council last week.
In the second round of the year, while the country's demand for wealth increased significantly, the demand for wealth rose by 54 percent in China, 51 percent in Turkey, 38 percent in Turkey and 33 percent in the Middle East, according to the same period of the previous year.
In the course of the term, the demand for tobacco in China continued to grow strongly, and the demand for gold rose by 87 percent over the same year, according to the expected increase in prices in the future, and 276 tonnes in this year's total.
In India, although the government has raised taxes to prevent the rise in the first round of gold exports, the demand for coal has increased by 71 per cent and 310 tonnes over the past year.
A handy Karadenez film: The Children of the Upensor
Dr. Dr. Trabzon...
And the players, they're from one of the beautiful, beautiful, smiling people of the Chicchidian village that was filmed...
Swedish Free
There's no repetitious film with only 400 thousand TLs. There's plenty of nature and chaos.
The film "We Want to Watch a Real Christmas Story" which is presented with love in the "Ismet Earth" film today.
The film "The Children of the Upensor's 1980s" which took place in Azzabat's Chiccludsky Village and all of the amateur players, was the cause of the film's fun appearances.
The AVM cinematium forum drew attention to the interest of the people of the galley press in the film.
They signed a wonderful night with the team, the Horonians, and the Karadenis Turks.
In Galea, Circulation and City Care Assistant Muhammad Balta, President of Trabzon Beleedi, Dr.Orhan Fevzi Gümrüksüksüw, Il Security Manager Early Early, Immunities and Tourism Manager Ismail Bloodless, Actakat Kaykamami Abdul Rauf Ulussoy, Actabat Beedi President Šefik Turkmen, and numerous representatives of sponsor companies, including national and local press representatives.
In a film directed by Dr. Ismet Eraydin, the head of the family is sharing Samet Karahasanoğlu, Aisše Öztörk, Koral Car, Salahuttır, Free Sarah, Adam Nature and Lahaid.
Today, 61 copies of the video were used by Turkey's Under-Secretary for Children's Education in Turkey for the first time in 1980.
The star on the roof!
Samt Karahasano is 18 years old.
You're looking for the best game for Samet living in Trabzon.
Amateur is a player with a history of theaters, comedy in the movie, and drama is a success under the load-loaded scenes.
Samt Karahanoğu, who deserves to the end of his career, received a "one of the players who will come" from the audience with the role of the government.
Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Come on!
It's about a film that tells about events that took place in Trabzon's Chicchidz village on September 12, 1980:
"The main character of the film is the work of young Hikmet's father in Germany.
It's one of Hikmet's greatest ghosts to be able to complete his education and be a doctor in the summer school.
There's nothing wrong with reading and working.
And all of a sudden, when the richest family in town hears Züleyha's daughter's love for her, it's going to be hard.
This love, which he has kept for years, is in the presence of the father of Züleha, who has decided to tell Züleha to his friends, such as Sabri Aga.
Sabri's daughter has other plans.
He is one of the greatest forces they have ever fought against the people of the land.
A short film long meters...
Dr. Ismet, director of the film in Galade, made comments about the 1980 Children's Children's Day, which were very small in the world:
"When we started this movie, our goal was to make a short film.
But the first drawings showed so much interest in the social media that we began to feel excited and excited to draw a long meter.
And when we went to the company that shared Istanbul, they said to us, "Do you have a good game?"
And I said, "We don't have the credit, but there's 86 other Karaden games you can't find anywhere."
So far, movies and films have used a lot of bad wires, and Karadenis has been mistakenly identified.
You're gonna watch 86 original Karaden people in the movie you're gonna watch.
I tried to draw a picture of your Karaden.
I wish others had drawn before me, but we'd have watched an incredible comedy movie.
If you hadn't been misinformed, I wouldn't have drawn this movie.
For the first time in the Turkish film, we put a letter under Turkish.
That's gonna be a first one.
We've done this so you can understand your karate wire better.
In addition, we put the English language courses in the film on the floor of Karadeniz.
Who we turned the camera when we pulled this movie?
The kids of the train are our first movie.
My mistakes may be my regrets."
Don't miss this hot movie that brings a new challenge to your cartoons!
Be careful when you choose your perfume!
Your feelings about your personal appearance are high; even if you are wearing perfumes in your hands, be careful.
The perfume you're using may be the cause of your liver disease.
We talked to Dr. Funda Ataman, the Isar Intercontinental Hospital Dermatology Officer, who was more often seen in women and who received perfumes from various cosmetics.
Dr. Ataman, who said that the sides of the Civatte Poikiloderum were a deep color disorder, which is seen in the inner and outer layers of the body (which are not covered up to six areas) in the outer layer of the Civatte Poikiloderum; ‘In general, it is associated with the presence of light-colored people in the sun.
It looks like red red clothes.
It is a date-palm, or a date-palm, or a date-palm.
Pulse is one of the choice of laser treatment and sun protection.
The other is the use of retinoic acid creams.
These creams should be used for a long time.
It's not the heat that can emerge during use, it's not the heat, it's the heat, it's the heat, it's the heat, it's the heat, it's the heat, it's the air, it's the air.
In this case, treatment should be continued inter alia.
In order to be a family, those who are parents need to be informed about early age protection and treatment.'
He's grown up in a cigarette shop.
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes consumed in the first six months of this year has increased by 41 billion to 779 million, according to the same cycle of last year.
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes consumed in the first 6 months of this year has increased by 41 billion to 190 billion by 560 million over the same period over the same period last year.
According to information provided by the TAPDK, the Global Research for Adults (KYTA) carried out by the Statistics Foundation in Turkey was completed with a view to obtaining information on the full level of use of adults in Turkey and creating a data source for decision makers and researchers.
According to the study, in general Turkey, in 2008, 31.2 per cent (16 million people) of the 15-year-old population (16 million people) were using all products per day or between, in 2012, this rate fell to 27.1 per cent (14.8 million people) and the total volume of use decreased to 13.4 per cent.
The percentage of men is 41.5, the percentage of women is 13.1.
The total number of men using this sample fell from 47.9 percent to 41.5 percent, while in women it fell from 15.2 percent to 13.1 percent.
According to the study, he's planning to quit smoking 6 out of 10 people who use the whole sample.
The proportion of those who thought of leaving the entire product within a month was 12.9% and 12% of those who planned to leave within 12 months was 35.4%.
In the evaluation section of the study, the following meetings were held:
"The net result of all products is that all control laws in Turkey and the National Control Programme and Action Plan have been applied.
As a result, the total number of tobacco users has decreased from 2 million in 2008 to 200 billion in 2012, and the rate of use has improved by 4.1 percent. The most significant decrease in tobacco use has been in price cuts, such as young people and less educated people.
According to the 2013 World Health Organization Report, Turkey has become the first and only country to provide all the criteria for its full control.
The report wants other countries to follow Turkey and take the example."
In closed areas, smoking law continues to show its effect.
In the first six months of this year, the number of cigarettes consumed increased by 41 billion to 190 billion by 560 billion, according to the same period last year.
This number was 46 billion 325 million at the same time in 2012.
The walls will be no more touching screens!
Ubi Interactive produced a very interesting product that used Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology.
Microsoft included 11 new kinect Accelerators program for the year we spent on supporting projects that will use Kinect in Windows.
The software cost these companies money, land, and hardware.
One of the most interesting software demos that came out of kinect Accelerator was shown by Ubi Interactive.
A demo serial designer comes in contact with Kinect for Windows and turns the projective screen on the wall into a touchscreen.
There are several companies supporting this technology according to a new post from the Kinect for Windows website.
The software that tested the organization over 50 within the private beta process is now being sold by Ubi.
Prices can be accessed from Ubi's website.
You need to check out 149 dollars for a 45-person touch screen.
If you have a 100-person touch screen capable of touching from 20 points, you'll have $1,499.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows files should only be purchased as a separate projector.
Android's new!
Google will make it easier for you to get files from this patent.
Google, the first open-ended interface between mobile operating systems and Android, has acquired a patent in a new interface technology that often shares files with his friends.
The function that contributes to the sharing of wireless technologies, such as NFC and Bluetooth, is actually not very different from the Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The latest news that Google has sent the signature is that this operation only provides information to the user groups in the area instead of the frequency shares and that it allows users to use it in a drive - leave it easy.
It's like it's gonna take place in future Android versions...
This is Turkey's first local smart phone.
Turkcell's been working on a smart phone.
It's gonna be in Turkey with a company of smart phones.
Name of T40
Turkcell identified Turkey's first local smart phone.
The smart phone to be produced in Turkey and with China in Turkey will be marketed at the end of July by the end of July.
Turkcell General Director of Syria Ciliv said they planned to sell a smart phone T40 known as the Gobze project, which was developed in cooperation with the United States of America's coffee producer Qualcomm.
Ciliv, who made a presentation at T40's launch, said that they also had a meeting with Turkish producers, "Some T40 in China; it will begin to be produced in Turkey by the end of 2013. "
THE WAY OF HAPPINESS
Ciliv, who said they're going to sell their phone at an appropriate price, explained that they're going to listen to the price near the market.
Ciliv said they were aiming to increase their income by increasing their use of a market-based phone with a price that could be more affordable than the sale of T40.
Ciliv, who said that the T series that Turkey has sold since 2010, said it's sold 1 million tons of mobile phones, said that it has attracted 500 million customers to the market.
WAYS IN WHICH SOME CHOOSE TO GIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE WORK
Turkcell General Manager Søreya Ciliv said there would be features such as T40's speech impediment, high resolution sound, surrounding sound and adjustable user interface.
Ciliv said that T40's price would be explained before the phone came to the market, that the phone price would be correct.
Each year, 5 billion dollars is spent
When President Tayfun Acarer, President of the Information Technology and Communication Foundation (BTK), who held a speech at the meeting, said that he supported local production, "57% of the telephones that came to Turkey are smart.
The average cost of the phones sold for this increase came at $300.
We're offering $15 million a year on the phone, and we're worried it'll get worse."
The Android operating system will operate on the platform T40, Qualcomm will have two cell processors and 1 GB RAM features.
It's all my priest!
The records of students in the normal environment have been updated as a teacher and secondary teacher
MEB has turned all primary schools in Turkey into primary schools in the year following the 4+4+4 revision of the school.
After a 1 year period of education, the re-introduction of a number of high school professors came into the middle of a new scandal during the process of conversion.
In Turkey this year, the "recovery" of all schools that are converted to the middle school came daily during the conversion and registration processes of the Czech Central in Meram of Konya.
1 year average
The first school in the Czech Republic was converted into a middle school in the early part of the year following the 4+4+4 revision.
In school, the first three and fourth grade students were attending secondary school, which would make a transition to a different school.
The school that has served as a regular average for 1 year has been converted into a high school with the end of the year 2012-2013.
This year's high school, which was turned into a "but master" school for the first time in the fifth grade.
However, last year's fifth grade was updated as a high school high school secondary teacher in an electronic environment for students who are in regular high school and who are going through the sixth grade this year.
'No other school'
My friends who knew my situation, they came to school and complained about my situation.
However, the school administration, in a statement from the National Education Administration, said to parents, "The parents who don't want their children to continue their schooling can bring their records to another location."
In a statement made by the National Education Authority, Konya made interesting statements.
He explained, "In view of the preferences of students and school numbers, we re-entered some schools with the status of the Konya Valley, and 15-20 schools were converted into priests in Konya.
Schools are entering your e-school system with school codes.
But when my school priest turns up, it's removed from the old school code system.
A new school code needs to be written by students on the system.
The students moved to the high school using the new system code so that they would not be too high for any different school students or teachers.
"The parents who want to get their kids out of these schools and give them other schools."

The request for family leave was rejected
INSTRUCTIONS ON USE / PACKAGE LEAFLET
The wife of the divorce case rejected the fact that a 24-year-old judge who had been convicted by Abbas Shahin, who had murdered Pënar Shahin, rejected the family's claim that the case was not a case of violence.
In the first instance of the case at the General Court, Abbas Shahin, the mother of the murdered Pënar Shahin, Aishe Two, and his brother Hediye Two, joined him.
Count Abbas Shahin ordered 4 pages of defense.
