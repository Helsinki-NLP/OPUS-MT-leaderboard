The cable of the spindle on today's snow with two sides and a curved neck between them. The two ends allow for the better handling of the ice, even if it is flattened.

To return to their former strength levels, they must consume more energy that they have found in the light.
This is done by removing a light bulb called "photon".
Scientists are calling this process "stimulating radiation" because atoms are driven by light, causing photon light to be emitted, and light is the type of radiation.
The next image shows the atoms that extract photons. In fact, photons are smaller than these in the stream.
Photons are smaller than atoms!
