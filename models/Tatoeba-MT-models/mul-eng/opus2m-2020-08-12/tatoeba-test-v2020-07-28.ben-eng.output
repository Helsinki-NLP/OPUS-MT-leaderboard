Tom and Mary are artists.
Tamori was born in 1945, when World War II ended.
You'll ask me again.
That's all wrong.
Close the door when you're up.
What does this word mean?
He's running now.
Good evening!
Go inside.
Keep your eyes on the door.
I'm a doctor.
He hasn't come yet.
I've got Tom Jackson on my name.
I'm reading your book.
Come on.
I'm looking around a little bit.
Here's your key.
He was right not to go to the party.
The magic room is now closed.
I'm losing my hand.
Everyone saw it.
It's good. It's good.
He's sleeping like kids.
Who are they?
What do I mean, you understand?
Would you please speak more slowly?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
Tom, you can't get out of here.
Tom's body's bad.
You can choose whatever you want.
Tom was helping me.
Leave him alone.
Let's wait here.
How long did the chattel bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I can get time to do this.
Tom's talking to her.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought something.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We ate dinner all night.
The school will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that down there?
It's just a football game.
The sky is clear.
Noscar!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he'd go to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's on his right.
What does this expression mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Stay here.
Have I been late for a while?
Leave her alone.
I can't tell you the truth.
Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom before.
How long has the train left for Tokyo?
Tom's having a big fight.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to the beach.
I don't own it.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you something.
The snow is represented by the superhero.
Come out.
They made fun of me.
I ran away from home.
We made pancakes for the old-fashioned.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if I'm coming.
You're kidding.
He's Kashalen.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my baby lunch in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my height.
Do what he says.
It's so nice to see you.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom keeps talking about him all the time.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18 and this is Muriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell our empty Tom to do this for us, right?
Can these be created?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom owes it.
Someone's got a knife.
I went to Bakery.
I learned to save him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Give them a break.
Tom was very busy at work.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm watching.
My watch doesn't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He's gone crazy.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
Now we have to go.
He's missing out on the reading.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He could easily warm his head.
Where he went, his dog followed him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my boat to pick up the old bottle.
I'm good at it.
I don't want to go.
When's the next bus leaving?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play a very good golf game.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did he say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom's been arrested.
How old is Tom?
Hurry up!
Shut the fuck up.
Was Tom there?
I've given blood to both of them today.
My back still hurts.
Where's Tom?
They look like Americans.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive very well.
I'll be alone.
You'll have to be your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his step, Jackson.
You know Tom a lot more than I do.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
I haven't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom doesn't have much to say about him.
It's good.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to check.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
And a little bit more?
One more day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that chaplain?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to claim my title?
We do what we want.
Tommy's okay.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who will you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I got.
No one's in need.
Are you here?
Everyone else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I've lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son is losing his economy.
The sky looks like the snow can start tonight.
How much will it cost?
You better know what Tom wants.
We'll eat.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those in the kitchen should not be left behind.
Why are you crying?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his baby back.
What's Tom at home?
Tom always keeps talking about him.
I'll eat breakfast.
I'm your friend.
How many were you?
Who's here?
The city is divided by a river east and west.
Look at yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to bed.
Do you have your car?
Tomo's playing guitar.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's running now.
Can you watch Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
That's the right thing to do.
How many are these gods?
How much more money should we give?
Everyone liked Tom.
What's going on here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Give them a break.
Eat whatever you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken your leg?
He's gone crazy.
We learned English.
I couldn't get my right foot.
I'm tired.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Khorgos likes the gas.
You don't understand.
Mary's hurting me.
Sit on the table.
He's younger than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use a credit card?
It's really big tonight, isn't it?
This book is available only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take her.
Can I pay with a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He's got a black hat.
Anything else?
They're all over.
Is there anything left for the students?
I'll eat nodules.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask how they're doing. Ask what they're doing.
Will you come inside?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He's eating empty fruit.
I want new shoes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'm going to cut the sand even if it's raining.
My right leg is breaking.
My father was busy.
They're all ready to go.
I couldn't get the 700 train.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's figure it out.
Would you like a drink?
The class doesn't start before eight.
How much time do you spend on that?
What does that word mean?
How much am I gonna get?
Can you say English?
They're wrong about what they did.
My son is far away from me.
Tom's parents were singers too.
Here's your business.
Tom's alive.
She's seen in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom's gone crazy.
How much of it?
You can eat as much as you want.
Get out of here.
I'm a little tired.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Bring it in.
How old are you?
Take Tom.
They're watching.
You're kidding.
I don't think tomorrow will rain.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I'll be fine.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Wednesday night.
He taught me to write.
Good morning!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Three people have been killed.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's father is an insuranceman.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's time.
I'll never make a mistake.
Where's the bathroom door at 111 UA?
I'm starving.
Why are you watching?
Tom wants his daughter back.
How much time do you usually start?
The country has made a deal between the two of them.
I'll talk to Tom in French.
Tom's eyebrows.
Can this be a little gift?
Tom's in custody now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's got his hands.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
She's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The attackers left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but it wasn't my time.
I lost my mind.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has appointed the director.
Get out of the city!
Enter the length of the rule.
He's eating.
How old is that chaplain?
Let's go!
It can be said by Japan.
Have you seen her grow up?
The chattel bus is leaving for the airport?
Don't fight.
It's my turn.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got Testa.
We were turning our hands around.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom was shocked.
Tom's very low.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much of it?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane was reached at the right time.
I don't know what you want to know.
Most of the visitors were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of food.
Tom's got a lot of driving.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom Gods are gone.
Everybody was joking.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook well.
They're out.
The investigation was successful.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom will be allowed to keep what he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17 too.
Here's your key.
Let Tom talk.
Take your bag.
Our name is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the folder?
Tom's upset.
Follow Tom's back.
Is Tom still okay with me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not hungry.
What do you know and what did you say?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you arguing?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
You'll know if I do anything.
We tried.
Tom left in October.
The market is next to the doctor's office.
Good day in Canada!
I'll be late.
What does this expression mean?
Tom's got his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue annars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Will you go with me?
Get out of here.
They're there.
I'll check it out.
All clear.
Don't make me sick.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuk.
When I said that Mary left town, Tom was really surprised to see him.
I heard the scream.
How long has your plan been?
I don't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up at 8:00 today.
Please let the light shine.
Tom's here.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the little way to go to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you care about her, Chinley?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
What the hell is going on?
Words that don't fit in are not correct. You can replace them with more common translations.
Your shoes are here.
Everything ready for the future?
Has anyone given me any news?
I want to eat for you.
Listen, is this train going to Washington Square?
We failed.
There's an ass in this house.
Are you all right?
Tom Boston's gone.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It'll be late in the evening.
I'm not proud of it.
Is anyone there?
It's all wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you go fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
One minute.
Tom was upset.
Mary explained it.
I don't deny it.
You don't see!
You can do it as quickly as possible.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I got up at seven in the morning.
I'm home.
Let's go.
Good morning!
I went inside.
Me too.
I'm not very busy.
It's very beautiful.
Go back!
Tom started out in the closet.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know it.
I'll stay close.
You'll call me tomorrow.
Tell me what.
My feet are shaking.
Ask Tom.
I think I'll give you what I'll give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you crying?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We played the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've done my job.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read it?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom enjoy this.
Don't come in.
We're lost.
Tom's watching.
We can still do it.
I was trying.
I'm sick.
I see it's empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
It's gone down.
I don't like to eat coffee.
Tell me more.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't do what he doesn't.
I called my good friend Tom.
We'll never be able to play better than this.
We're Lazuk.
The building will be destroyed today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat as much as you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
