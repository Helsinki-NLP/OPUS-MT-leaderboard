Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take your thumb off.
He's running to the station every morning.
They're going to finish their mission.
Not here.
No one was pleased.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
That's why it's somewhere in this building.
We'll be open tomorrow.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a beer bottle.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us color our hair?
Were you in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.?
Mary kept her balance.
I just got lucky.
They're very subjective.

It's not enough!
Tom said that Mary might still be involved.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with him.
The chief allowed me to leave earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How nice!
When I'm in the wrong mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It'll be cold enough tonight.
I'm not gonna ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to leave.
One day we'll meet again.

There is no real hope.
It's not mine.
What do you want yourself, Tom?
We're almost there.
So you need to be home by 2:30.
Are you going to school for a walk?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting time.
The molecule is composed of atoms.
We're aware of that.

My head hurts.
Do it again, please.

Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little young for me.
Tom, take care of yourself.

Tom's awful.
The Aptek is on Fresno Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you willing to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Lucy already called?
It looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I'm just about to get lost.
It's delicious!
Tom mentioned some problems?
Where's Tom got to do this?
Mary wants me to be in her command.
No one's listening anymore.
You're shy.
You should do this yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put it on.
Tom came last.
The hands will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate on her own.
You're gonna find them?
I'm having a bad temper.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where'd you get that key?
Can I help you, ma'am?
I don't think it'll be easy for me.
Tom's going instead of you.
You think the fish hear?
Tom got off last night.
A woman reads.
Poor Tom is trying to sleep for three hours.
Tom moved to Australia.
We need to remember that.
I changed my Wi-Fi password.
It's not my problem.

They're brothers.
Mary said she'd do it.
I'm older than him.
Tom's in the gym.

Unity is better than unity.
Chitai!
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom said he wouldn't sleep all night.
I just remember the noises.
Open the valve.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
Do you like to do this?
Tom went into the kitchen.
Where did you get into the museum?
Do you want to eat a bed?
I'm sure Tom's carrying a message.
I don't have children.
Let Tom do this on his own.
She's in the fridge.
We're ready to help.
His brother was a very hard worker.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's using you.
Where's my clothes?
Perhaps you need to help him.
Save yourself.
No one knows his real name.
I'd love to sing with your throat.
We avoid talking about politics.
I won't answer that.
I decided to let you go.
Everyone's laughing.
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
Tom asked you to see him?
I'll be very surprised if you leave Japan.
Did you ask Tom?
This woman says that she's like a teacher.
Tom allowed you to do what you wanted?
Tom has salad.
Now I'm unarmed.
I feel like an ambiguity.
This book has many pictures.
I think we lost her.
Was that always the same?
Tom already knows what he's planning to do to Mary.
He's an army officer.
What did you do then?
Tom said I was acting irresponsible.
I drank too much.
Tom bought Mary a suit.
We're teachers.
Dad quickly left the paper.
How the hell did Tom get here?
Tom's grown up, isn't he?
You really like me, don't you?
I don't have any money.
I don't believe in bass.
Go make an appointment outside.
I can do it on my own.
After a snowflake, a flight from Beijing was delayed for 20 minutes.
I used to watch TV.
Is this your house?
They were really happy.
Tom cut his throat.
Thank you for coming.
We should trust them.
Do you understand phonetic object?
They said they were innocent.
He knew me.
Tuman's breaking up.
I'm sorry I'm worried about you, but can't you help me?
Tom quickly opened the door.
Today's Wednesday, October 18th.
We'll do it.
Tom did it for you?
She knows her.
Tom said he'd be here.
Tom doesn't agree with you.
Hello.
We don't need time anymore.
Are you studying French at school?
They're one-year-olds.
My watch's gone in five minutes.
That's why I liked this idea.
I heard him die.
Show me what to do.
Tom knew me with my wife.
I didn't think we did it.
Tom's not hard to find.
I have a little money.
They argued about who should sit ahead.
Tom and I both cried.
What languages are you talking about?
I don't want to worry about you.
He took the first place on the chess tournament.
Is his story true?
The day Tom was born in October, and I was born in November.
You have the right to be happy.
I'll meet him next Friday.
Don't worry, you can count on me.
Tom's car parked there.
Give them a second chance.
Tom knows we don't want him to win?
Come on, don't talk.
The object-oriented programming is, first of all, an indirect address.
You're calling me today.
Why do you want to go back to Boston?
It's a pocket dictionary.
Tom's working on it right now.
We want to talk to Tom.
Have you already been drinking?
What do you know about Boston?
Tom, maybe he was a witness.
The station is near.
I won't wear this dress.
You should be yourself.
Get away from me.
I played tennis.
You're 10 years old?
This soup is salted.
Did something strange happen?
I wonder if Tom's scared or not.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Did you see my hand?
I usually go to the supermarket on Mondays.
I hate surprises.
I promised him not to do this.
Such cats don't have tails.
You can sit down if you want.

Tom might forget to do this.
Who knows.
She was white.
Tom doesn't swim very well.
I saw these pictures.
You lost your guitar?
Tom was one of the last to leave.

I'm not sick anymore.
Tom's not very nice.
Aren't you free tomorrow morning?
Give him vitamins.
The machine generates a lot of electricity.

I don't know what's going on.
Tom.
I dreamed of a strange dream tonight.
What can you tell me about it?
Did you really see the NLO?
You're messing with me and Tom.
I had a different teacher!
What do you like about Tommy?
All I still have is one book.
I hid it under my bed.
I thought you'd be happy.
That's really nice.
You shouldn't have signed a confession.
How do you feel today?
Here's our interpreter.
Oh, my God, I'm an atheist.
This is my daughter.
I gave it to his little boy.
Did you think about it?
Math is an object I love less than everything else.
Take Tom home.
I hid him somewhere.
Aren't you coming to my party?
I was in the car.
She said so, like she was my mom.
I'm a very shy person.
Tom's not aggressive at all.
Why did you do that?
Tell him I'm in the office.
Spanish is your native language.
Why isn't Tom singing?
Don't you like my yellow scarf?
To make her nose slightly shorter, she would be quite sympathetic.
You can't do this on your own, can you?
Tom lives near here.
He did this through zeal.
Tom wanted to help.
Tom's married to a woman named Mary.
You were at work?
I just don't want to talk to you.
When did you get married?
I'll warn Tom.
Tom finally agreed to do this.
You think Tom's unpredictable?
Are you leaving a message?
We get closer to each other.
We wanted Tom.
He's older than me.
The thinker shot the bird.
Why do you need my help?
I've picked up my speed.
Tom gave me three apples.
Why are you alone?
I'm sure Tom wouldn't agree.
I translate the article.
I think we should do this.
Her answer was unsatisfied.
I work hard.
Can't you speak French?
I'd go without Tom's help.
I'm thirty.
We're in Italy.
Put your candle on.
I want some good food.
My dad's home.
I knew you'd suspect me.
I told you everything.
Don't go any closer.
Did you really see the NLO?
Better wait for the next bus.
Have you been praying for a sunscreen?
Tom said you were expected to be at the party.
This guy's a bad guy.
Let me do it.
Nothing special.
Didn't anyone help you?
No one saw him.

He's talking about himself.
Now isn't the time to play.
I work in Boston.
Do you prefer media or explosives?
That really helped us.
How did you feel?
I wonder if Tom really is in trouble.
Did you hear the news?
Can you see the blame card?
You must be very calm.
Tom did not want to change his plans.
Mary wore a captivating coat.
You prayed.
I know I'm imperfect.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
I'm going to be at risk of making a statement.
This guy eats bread.
I won't eat it.
Why should children be born if they can be adopted?
I'm glad to see you here.
I'll be present.
She can wait till the morning.
I was a winner.
I'm coloring the garage.
Not cold.
I've already called.
Who's your father after the ghost?
I want Tom to know I don't hate him.
I realize how much you're probably upset.
I've got a brown hair.
I'll show you something.
Tom's upset.
Tom did it deliberately.
I broke my spaghetti.
What do you like about that?
Hey, what's that?
We'll do everything in our power.
Everybody's going.

Then I'll be there later.
Tom refused blood.
I'm in Boston a lot.
I've got a stone in my pocket.

I'm sure Tom wasn't surprised.
You're aggressive.
Why are you late?
I haven't called him yet.
That apple under the table.
Tom and I flew on one plane.
I'm still with them.
He's worried about the ice cream.
I thought you wouldn't mind.
Choose for us.
Get up!
You wanna see?
Tom shot a drummer from under Mary's.

Tom is dealing with this problem.
I hate my job.
Tom's gone.
It's all your time.
I was talking to someone on the phone.
Tom said he couldn't hold back from doing this.
I wonder if I can repeat it.
What you say is true.
I don't think Tom can help us now.
Thank you very much.
You need help, don't you?

I want a lot more.
You don't have to let him do this.
Tom gives us good advice.
It's easy for me to drive this car.
I changed my website.
I have eight brothers and sisters.

A childish thief pulled out at Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs all two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.

Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what the climber looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I wasn't on that bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary already did what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
You booked a chair?
Where did the money come from?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you dead.
Turn off your cell phone, bitch.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's like going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy flowers at the concert until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe another time.
Tom refused to let Mary go home.
Tom doesn't play very well in tennis.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do this alone.
You need Tom here.
We've finished the oil.
What do you think they want?

Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book on Christmas.
I want cheeseburger, hand and cardboard free.
She stole the camera.
Please go to your new home!
With my account record, there's a problem.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
All right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do this.
Who's not right?
Your songs include professional singers to redefine from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need more than that.
Oh, my God!
Tom, please.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week I had a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how this is going to happen.
Five?
Tom, will we do this with you?
You don't sleep?
The meeting started on Friday.
Mary said she liked to do this.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was in Tokyo only once.
I got an electricity account.
What color is its light?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom and I'll be fine.
He broke his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You don't appreciate them.
Your parents would write for you.
I was born in May.
I'm fine, too.
I'm happy.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this?
We're satisfied with the decision.
This afternoon is raining.
I saw Tom target Mary.
He stood in the door.
She cried out loud.
Tom was deeply moved by his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
He'll find out for himself.
The Witness who has seen everything on his own deserves more than ten witnesses who have heard it.
Guess who I am.

Tom's done.
When I went to the room, she was playing piano.
You're so cute.
What are your ways?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw it at Mary's egg.
When do you expect to come?
Tom was exaggerating my sister - in - law.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is going?
Mary's high.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a cross.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vessel with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'm in.
I don't want to.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I guess Tom won't be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'll take care of your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's almost news.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very smart.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very attractive.
Are you scared?
You ruined my life.
We need to think of a secret language.
Are you planning on staying too long?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids at school.
I've set my balance.
I got out of the car.

Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant desert.
Sleep on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We were able to cross the river.
He's obviously in love with you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French lecturer.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
I don't blame anyone.
The flight's about nine.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John grabbed the tiger and shot two Levites.
Don't worry, I'll check it out.

What happened to Tom?
It's a braslet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't protect herself.
The next month Tom leaves Boston.
It'll burn.
Let's get some rest.
Each year millions die of hunger.
I was curious about what Tom wanted.
The list contained the wrong address.
It's the last move.
Who's gonna fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I need to be more careful.

We were able to save them.
He's a weird person.
I'm just getting fired.
Mary said that she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
We're responsible for it.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost $50 somewhere.
I knocked on the door.
His theory deserves attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
The help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The shower is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
So Tom became well - known.
You've had a good time, haven't you?
You sang.
I did everything out of my mind.
I like to write.
Kyoto is an exceptional city.
In the next month, I am 16 years old.
Do you think it's possible that this is going to happen?
Calm down with your dreams.
What time will your final lesson end?
I'm here to apologize, Tom.
I like this dog.
I was trying to get in touch with her.
What's she got?
How's it going?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are taking care of this.
We should help him.
It's been raining all day.

Can I have your phone number?
You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who told you you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock's gone for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines on the sun, and the night is the moon.

Seven colors.
I think that's why you shouldn't do this.
He's tired today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his open mind.
Aren't you on your own tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How are things with your wife, Tom?
I'll accept your proposal.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
That's where you or Jane should go.
In your place, I'd have ignored it.

I would never have done this without your help.

When did it start?
I love free cardboard.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for yesterday.
Tom says he's got a tenor.
Don't listen to him. He'll do some stupid things.
It's just that there's only the rocks on the ground.

Wouldn't it be better for you to do this to Tom?
Who ran?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain it to me?

How many nights?
I'm twice as old as you.
She's like a family daughter to me.
It wasn't Tom, it was Mary.
They're right.
You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo?
At about the same time, Tom was in his room and learned.
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary really likes to do this.
I know it's just for you.
Put that sticker in your pocket.
I thought you said you were the only child in the family.
I have a few French books.

There are exceptions to each rule.
Tom knew something was going to happen.

They voted.
I refuse to talk to you!
She's red.

She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do everything he asks for.

What are we going to do?
Tom's getting nervous.
Tom can wait here.
Brother lives in Boston.
I always liked him.
What a wonderful life!
You can do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Sadly, she already has a constant love.

Is he still with you?
Do you like chess?
I knew they'd suspect her.
He crossed through the basement.
Don't die, please!
Who won?
What are some of the arguments that may help us?
Would they do that?
He's my friend.
Are you ready for the test?
All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.

You'll never be alone.

You don't have to be nervous about these little ones.
You're an asshole.
Is that you?
Please call the doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?
Is that the only solution?
They're not sure they did not.
It'll be very difficult to do this.
It's ours.

So what do you propose?

We haven't been very cold yet.
You see the boat Tom?
Tom doesn't do anything in his power.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're alone.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of another planet.
He picked up the bullet and pressed it between his big and pointed fingers.
It's delicious.
Women are so weird!
I've already considered this idea.
Tom hit me on my head.
Why do I care?
I can swim on the lakes.
Do what they tell you.
I'm looking for you.
Some didn't want to fight.
You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book inspired me.
I don't believe Tom's coming back.
I've lost my hats.
Tom is getting older soon.
Tom said I had a terrible look.
I had a little argument with Tom.
"When are you going back?" "It depends on the weather."
I'm a voter?
It's a Scottish name.
Is he a hot dog butterbrode?
Thank you for yesterday.
Don't you see why you need your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom’s wife told me he didn’t have a home.
I bought Tom's watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't beat me.
It's usually wearing a tie.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm going over there.
The dog's name is Ken.
I was fair.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to paint cards.
He's a liar.
What's your computer?
I'm not grammatical.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do this.
Your medicine is ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, every one of you, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was an alien, and she was treated as an alien.
Karen went there alone.
Am I upset?
The girl we saw was Mary waiting for someone near Tom’s house.
Why don't you stop burning?
We're all making mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I've had a lot of sugar.
Can you swim on the couch?
I know how to do it.
Tom's here?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have to say something.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
I'm calling Tom Pig.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two couples.
What is Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary wanted to do this.
Tom and Mary said they didn't get sick.
I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had an insulin last year.
My mom's got dinner ready.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back faster.
He's incompetent.
I've been training.
He's impatient.
He's sure he'll make an experiment.
Tom voted for the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's start!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too clear.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm impressed by the Devil's literature.
The pain is because she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their son John.
I wonder if Tom's really going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he had been through the past?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's do nothing at all.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm di Jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was it wrong enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child's gone.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn how to control yourself.
We're fine.
My wallet's stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
He's talking.
The air’s surface is an unecliquidated area, so it does not meet the rules of the ecliptic geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You two are older than me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I've let go of the sword.
I hate this city.
He's now living in Tokyo.
Programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many hours do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
That's why I don't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very impressed with you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to get off his clothes.
I need this money.
My tie is orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
So it's supposed to be higher.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
You brothers?
It's not my idea.
You got a plan, don't you?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I've had a seizure.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a yellow dress.
In love of the mountain goat.
The meeting ended.
You should have done this last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I got an old machine.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like a teacher.
They went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockeyist.
We went to the woods looking for the cows.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small bottle of coffee cost two euros.
Motherly love is more than anything.
He was persecuted by thieves.
I worked in the restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think it is.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
As many jars were broken down on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich with natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful machine!
She missed school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I have to do this.
State debt increases.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
That's a bitch.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a monster.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bicycle?
Speak for a moment.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to take care of it.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could.
I'm an interpreter.
You've had a good time, haven't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time online.
You're great.
Tom said he was going to complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't do this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's gone in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very fast.
You don't need it.
I'm sorry, can I open the window?
How's it going?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't worry about you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese girl.
What did you eat today for dinner?
You can't even change the paper.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she left school.
This word is derived from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't worry.
The car outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There's no rules.
Leila was very busy.
He's not lying.
Do you know how to make salads from the cheese fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There is no doubt that rain will come.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We really went to Boston.
In Iceland there are many volcanoes.
John is two years older than I am.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little tired.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who's missing?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom's still living with you?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't leave the rocks.
She's got a dog?
I was a witch.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
Tom, you'd like it.
Are you hungry yet?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited hours for him.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the twentieth year.
Tom's probably gonna take care of this.
It must be the right color.
Tom's really tough mom.
After a short peace, the war was over again.
It's better not to trust him.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The head of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
I'm sorry, couldn't you give me sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his own house?
"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to meet.
It's your green one.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does it work?
You're very honest.
Come on, guys.
I'll fix it.
When is it expected to return?
I had a good rest.
He's no better than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making a lot of mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It'd be good if there were 28 hours at the time, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a di Jay.
Tom soon learned to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They're able to catch fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still busy this Sunday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom is a Frenchman.
I was trying to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have a book.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, like, a man-man.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any clues.
It's a rehearsal.
It's not Tom who asked Mary to do this.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom often makes mistakes.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom had never been in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, where Gran-pry was transferred.
Tom writes to his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my mother tongue.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm hungry?
I'm too rich.
What's this girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you don't have to do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom called Mary.
Her neighbor cares for the children until she is gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
You remember that summer when Tom hit his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I've got thirty eyes.
If I don't do this, Tom's gonna be upset.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write it down?
A big tree fell on my way, and when I left, my way was blocked.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that's going to shine.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do You Believe in God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you starting to cry?
What do you like about men?
Why Do People Still Burn?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I tried to do it myself.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new gift.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my young sister Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was born, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday may be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
You may need to help him color the park.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and on the contrary?
Can you help me?
You're stupid.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I gave you the documents on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The mob broke when we got up.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you would probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Is Mary not going?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to go to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how it is done.
Don't you see anyone?
All the lions are busy.
I didn't make my decision.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I won't talk to Tom French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple tree.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Grandfather is your father’s brother or mother.
You know who they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in Ginsach.
See you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a kite.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom entered the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I didn't see you for all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
You want to do this, huh?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays a dog twice a day.
Let me see this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hockcaydo, Sycoca, Honsey, and Cussey.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be such an expert?
I won't help you.
I'm tired.
I'm not a monster.
She touched her eyes.
No one can be compared to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get it?
She committed suicide.
We've got our computer office.
It's supposed to pay for a while.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you blamed me for.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
You agreed?
I'm here to pick up my book.
I'm still speaking French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book became an object of criticism.
It's going to be great.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under a mouse.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom's gonna do this?
Tom witnessed to Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom doesn't hurt Mary.
Can you ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's upset.
I know many French teachers.
You're not exactly like her.
Can you play on the script?
Can you give me the power?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom's good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He himself was popular among both students and lecturers.
You're not going to help with your tears.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go anywhere you want.
I'll see you later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he breathes.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up his ear.
I'll be right back.
The church is near the top of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Tom is trying to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell Tom he did it.
He's talking to the spy with a little French accent.
It's not your turn.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't deal with it.
She's got a nice way.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like speaking French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a doll.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a witch?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
The answer is yes.
Will you let Him drive you away?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom threw Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He came back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The tongue is sensitive to the rules of its own tongue, even if it does not recognize them.
Tom's on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The thinkers set their swords against the elephant.
No one cares.
They were trying.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian.
Do you have any allergic reactions?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I'm gonna push Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are yellow.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom, did I vote?
I'll be right back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you color the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom's still gonna want to come.
You don't run.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to laugh about?
Where did you get the cannibals?
This year you received a gift from Tom?
I still feel a little tired from home, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a memory problem.
Where's Mom?
He disappeared three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
There's no need to talk.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you knew Tom.
Very good!
You know why?
Check voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little out of the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to get a cab here?
Faster because you'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Is that how Tom always behaves?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's all working, you see.
She threw him out.
Tom's safe.
I finally got the water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's your wife?
You're totally right.
Tom's not rich, but Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite hand.
Everyone's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not going to shake the boat.
Money won't breathe.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those shots.
Good afternoon.
Please write your name to the flock.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to play tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's up there?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the specimen can be compared to a plastic tree that has been created slowly.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
You know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be such a heart.
Tom's got a nice garden.
I know when you're kidding.
I know you just did your job.
We're going to go for a walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was kidding?
So it was terrible.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be at the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
He died under torture.
It's impatient.
I need a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get your ass out of here.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston card?
Your sister is always wonderful.
This will be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you hurrying?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you need to take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his obvious idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom didn't want to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white suit.
Check it again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything from the main pain?
Children imitate friends rather than parents.
Tom's down.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus she had left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
The bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where are you living?
Now they're worthless.
Did I try to talk to them?
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
The planets fly and pick up our work.
Don't worry.
Bell made a phone call in 1876.
You're going for a walk?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
Is that why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He walked around the corner, and he didn't come back.
Save your games together.
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
I think I'm fine.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You should do what Tom tells you.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago I was very rich.
It's not easy to do.
Tom died.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the bottles.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
That box was a distraction.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I just wanted to sell it.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would.
You let something go.
I called Tom right away.
You seemed interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
In Kena two cats.
I understood why I was wrong.
I like trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in the sunglasses.
Tom's good at drawing.
All you need to do is press the red button.
You looked very suspicious.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you now.
I don't care.
He wants to see you a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Tom really thinks he's listening?
I don't think so!
Tom, you can say, nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go sooner.
I met him casually.
Why does she like you?
The problem is that solar energy is too much.
I'm very old.
Tom's grateful.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How about "thank you" in Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Can't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He gave birth to the orphan.
I played baseball.
It deserves a better life.
I got a ticket.
You're such an impatient person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in learning French.
I'm fine, please.
I don't have time to read.
You have a lot of literature I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your work.
Are you working somewhere?
You admit it, don't you?
I've got business tomorrow.
I'm not leaving.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm tired.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, I don't usually don't understand.
I'm doing everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is Mary.
