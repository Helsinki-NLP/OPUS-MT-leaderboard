The rest of the UKIP who reject those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage said that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom for health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use special arguments, then you deduce them by a vulcanized homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to do the aftershocks behind the chronic hypocondria that think they're all right.
I think it's you who use special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the rule of law, does not exist practically.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by the measures of the UKIP against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell may appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch is not a proof.
Yeah, so pull on the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be fired to spread such popular propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is very surprising, but only because we are talking so rarely about this problem.
It has absolutely no homophobic note.
You'll have to be able to get it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rare because unlike Farage and his united disciples of Thatcher who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that human complexity is something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is likely both in Ireland and in Spain.
With the new crisis that takes place during the austerity period, there will be nothing.
Waiting for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland's ''TIGRE OF EUROPE' has benefited us a few years ago.
We met the suite!
This begins reading the article again.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a virtual country and that a '' NEW MIRCLE ECONOMIC' is being produced.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-sustained job path, a continuing migration.
With these ingredients there is no ''pavorize' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal In view of the constant tolerance, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was standing in front of us.
Their development has not been a long-term quiet stream, it is in the light of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
There is now a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report from 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5 per cent in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on all sides of the road, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily pockets since the return.
Is it supposed to be economical?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon come to light.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra is involved in an increase on A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bushes and raisins on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That says I fly with him next week, so I hope it won't be on either of these two once.
So this would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers an additional supplement for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you wouldn't be allowed to go on vacation, young man
I've never taken Ryanair, and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give them a heart of joy.
Any article on Ryanair reveals dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who suffer from something other than basic tariffs have to take themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be pleased with the additional costs of this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and if it is necessary to pay passengers and, if that is the case, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of airport controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane for less than an hour, they have no right to compensation.
I'm sorry to miss you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that carries the English ISIS in Syria, not as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, France-Burgeois Street: the Marais is mostly Pietonier, and is literally global.
People don't come in mass for the quality of restaurants (sometimes, for most) or for the Review Hall at the Whites-Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectually and slightly dusty).
The reason for this group is that the shops are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and alive.
With many foreigners who depend..
Do you think the opening of Monday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Frances Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, world-run with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that I felt acceptable was that of areas receiving an important number of foreign tourists and it is highlighted by the fact that they buy detachment.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of business numbers every year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to fall.
Dominic rest is a right which is beneficial, except for the benefit of employees.
That is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor the rest, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have the minimum competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're staring at her.
What does that law mean?
Satisfying a part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I'll take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the wee!
This is access to culture ...
And this is also the rule of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was against his will to be used to pay the cost of succession?
There are drawings.
Some are well, others are not terrible.
No doubt his successor would want his share of the cake if you gave me the expression.
His preference for the victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Not much more.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis, and he won very much.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and its energy, it united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and finally the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and nothing else.
The size of Churchill has nothing to do with this discussion.
The fact that its descendants sell paintings on the free market in order to collect the money of follow-up costs could even benefit them.
If the public wants to admire one in a museum, they will collect money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
When it was “the time of truth, ” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A break in the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding packaging, infrastructure canisters with a low-renewable definition.
With regard to social reforms proposed by the Minister, they are well reflected in the French reality: lack of confidence in dialogue
Returns to the values of the prince.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Whether we come to his assistance on a solid basis, or whether he has DROT in exchange for services he has provided or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer for the smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives from his property's income.
There is a need to distinguish the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his pension.
One thing to rent wants two for a couple above, it's time
The little genius of the Finance is lacking only imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are overcrowded.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so nothing new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession which is only a wild growth.
You'd be right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) bars, coal mines, roads...
But if we want to reduce the future climate-energy shock, then the need for investment is growing: insulation, railway network renewal, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A tax system that promotes high income and pensions.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's benefit.
I think it's necessary that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we knew a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open-source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underage philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them options, functionality and premium price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car builder", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flowering port industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It's healthier and has to be encouraged.
That's who's of our interest to everyone.
I am happy that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that this is not an Apple product, even though I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our impfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting the ideas and not the men (but even on the Parisese Bobos) could tell us what author(s) they are fighting the ideas about the kind and tell us the works they just understand to fight.
Or are they just attacking the kind described in The Figaro, Minutes or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you very much, and you're someone of intelligence and culture.
I said this about Judith in the wine of Furusato calling Holopherne, near which I wasn't coming (I don't have his spirit life).
Otherwise, in the "ground", because you refer to it, I don't care about it, and I really don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends can get out of my way, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that , culturally , to send Judith to Holopherna , that is the fact .
Who's afraid to ask for the World?
But what do we fear those who fear?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by calling Judith of the Bible , the second by qualifying Judith Butler for a very symbolic cross-section of the throat.
We see how close these studies are to them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on the idea.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, Jean, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it should go to the sources.
I don't think it's very hard to fight ideas from the only exposure to their tractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of the Genre or X Lacroix, theologian).
But as I explain it to our empfrontist friend is the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on any more than he's got the touch.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat breaker, I liked the "Second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's views.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed when the clouds opened.
This Sudanese appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment that sometimes the vision blocked by the clouds.
It was fun here at the FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the lab responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also been able to cover itself throughout the entire week of the rain of Perseide meteors and for virtually all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I start to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything in heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, even though things greatly improve on the other side of Cordillere.
There were between 10 and 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse due to clouds above the Melbourne Bay.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I guess your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you fall asleep.
Who or what will overtake you when he ends up (forcing) by disappearing?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages that people are critical of the Abbott government to then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It would be said that Mars would enter into collision with Earth!
Nothing about bourgeois and real estate speculation.
There is nothing about inequality between income from work and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Extra liberalism is currently killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not.
The details and arguments of these allegations are not given.
No hypertext link to original documents so that you can make an opinion.
Let's see today on Tuesday 15 October the results of the miracles: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest since five years.
In Greece the bourgeoisie is falling apart.
However, it appears that there are examples to follow.
Notary reform would generate an application for an order of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Department of Economics has made a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who imposed the political advantage resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
It's his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL....
@lol Not the State is not comparable to households with the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while the household is born by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered ineffective, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments of tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
A few elements of response.
A sad decision.
But remember the sacred word of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of world pharmaceutical societies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice theory of the complex.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied to the law as it is written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than for the risk of surgery, the safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than for having them in the streets, etc.
Politicians want to please the incult masses on these issues.
In fact, doctors do not earn money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmaceuticals.
doctors don't get money with medicines Because the Liberals want our health system to look like that in the United States, you should know how it works.
Doctors around the world are short of the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the tubes, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of companies and the "search".
So read the few reports on our costs of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences of one country to another on what is available for free sale or only on order.
This is strengthened by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrict them and the honours they need.
Although the manufacturers of certain medicinal products are likely to not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version of good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
I'm sorry to tell you, but you're mistaken, there's a lot of things going on in the colleges for doctors and pharmacists.
As for this hospital, they were happy to serve until someone put the powder in the ear of a hospital officer.
We can't keep letters on the tree...
If social scientists did research instead of policy and networking, their "work" could be used.
An investigator, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
It's not like it's looking.
Comparing it is doing the pedagogy not the research.
It can't be said "the search is over" and then in the same bag "it has to be experienced at any time".
If your research is over, why experiment?
If your research isn't sufficient why do you ask us to apply them?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot be like math alone could easily be like mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn the condition that they learn to use new technologies but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
The input tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying.
What does it mean to build an indicator that informs you of what is going on, a will of self-promotion, a fraud?
One way to train teachers is to avoid the training of sociologists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory relieving the paragraph on the stages (which helas is not very well-argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservationism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of practices in force, which does not allow us to progress the system " .
Given the general consensus on the status of the French system, only practitioners can teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Theorists of education should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to the theories of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogie is totally boring: if I didn't like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would rather be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Deputy Conservative for the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exams thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating the copyright, I'll have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, violation of copyright = flight.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not all the same thing.
Using the content without adequate license, you are deprived of the artists of their bread.
You can always discuss painful hypotheses, but it's a flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so real.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating the copyright
Obviously, this doesn't make it difficult for you to privacy the artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a very perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions that they have passed a click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 ballader's listeners with a partner in the school bus, they should be expelled to violate the law in this way.
Oh, if we could export this resource we'd like, the guy who says it's all going wrong....
If it's a PS member who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they're old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France draws people to the bottom with constant assistance.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What brings France down here is the speeches like you.
@gus I've been working in a private company ever since.
I had the chance to work in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm paid because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to pull red balls on the empty patterns I often meet.
In my pockets I share fully Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that the French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany, the companies have their industrial fabric structure to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium- and small enterprises - what do the French employers expect to do so?
What's the state holding their hand?
What state do they charge with imperiality?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti-corporate business couple on your side!
Remember, what did you create as employment, as added value, to be also severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insolvent problem: the incompetence of the heads of French companies unable to create jobs, which is encouraging and degrading while awaiting the permanent assistance of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: the abolition of the Labour Code, the patronage charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, can claim the reduction of wages without their removal!
I would like to see all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is how people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us contributors.
They tried to keep themselves in a fleet instead of transforming themselves.
This doesn't mean that ice-cream roads aren't improved since Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Railway.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this, heylas.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
Well, the work's gonna pull us out again, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral business and taking part in bids.
But it seems that we are not very well managed, most of our private services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virginia contract, all so that the decision would finally be cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the 8-year cross-border operation contract.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated it during the referendum campaign, is absolutely for the commonization and sharing and believes that workers must all go beyond the borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision;)
It may be because the management of the Netherlands is on good rails while the British are not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of owner but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the worst option possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchise.
"It was a fighter girl."
Sir, I have, but I really have this kind of expression.
He assumed that being "batting" is a quality higher than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "batting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: fighting cancers, which are no longer dead, I know the spokeners.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again.
I'm not telling you it's LA condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDS.
Nothing to see with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there's just you to judge them.
It's the beginning.
Insinuating, it would be only an instant, that we may have the right to get out of a disease or that we may be forced not to get out of it, is simply a monster.
The body follows or does not.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in medicine, do you have an idea of what C is?
It is natural to think otherwise, if, having a strong moral will undoubtedly make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them for fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first of all someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to return it to "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are for moralists themselves.
When you catch a salad, a real one, you're gonna get rid of it just to become a zombie.
I personally attracted two, salads, big ones, and if I'm "bout" as these psychologists say, it's completely out of my mind.
Unless this fight is just to close your teeth, to suffer the pain and to crush your hips.
I thought that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen this name in the newspapers since then.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten anniversary.
His process was carried out “fastly ” and then flowed under the tape.
Is this the story we told at the time?
Has the communist become a nationalist who has launched three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MONDRE International Law Rule?
Which country did Serbia attack you?
With regard to RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be evaluated by the Western compressor wheel.
The West used a smoke screen to detect a part of a sovereign State which then unilaterally declared its independence and was fully recognized by the Western States who then lied mainly about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now disappeared completely (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic from Tiran (even if we do not like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting seismic phenomena in Greece that is about to take place by measuring the level of pézoelectric in the quarter.
This kind of study is indisputably useful and thanks to us for sharing the results.
A hope, however, is that this water has nothing to do with that of the planet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of Maryland University.
Method to be followed.
Like those that involve animals that feel a threat to arrive.
Thank you, Passer of Science, for providing us with these experimental trials that are being carried out in the world.
How could the animals (A advance) be saved?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements where the rate evolves in case of seismicism.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has inodorous priorities for man but may be depleted by animals.
All these methods are identifiable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have any reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed several times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for hours with a seismic, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I have seen an art report relating to the fight against two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and especially to their modification before sex.
So I'm not scientific at all, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why are you so mad at this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we consider things calmly and strictly, we publish them in a serious review, and no one denies them.
Once we speak of the "signs" given by animals, we meet in the same way: the whole world will remember that 5 minutes before a seismo, the red fish would turn strangely around.
I don't understand how we can think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did it too much as a mother from London.
When we hear the LBC program we can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing and that he's always trying to make a difference with a blog.
He never answers directly to any of these.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't count one point.
He made so many promises to make himself a mayor and he didn't keep it alone.
This only makes it clear to what extent the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's crazy.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and we've got people involved in the worship of celebrity.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the rate of popularity of the Tories will cover the ceiling I am certain.
May God help us.
I am not so sure: people like the blogs, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we told Londoners.
He should've brought his friend up with him, smarter than him.
Anyway, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French are indeed and are still interested in the history of the war of the Pacific.
For all who have been punished for reading a few books (it exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferrous destruction" speak, both unfortunately and the dead who are left there.
It is understood that Australians who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there since the battle of Savo) did not want to return.
We're actually going past the island of Savo in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even when the mission is reaching its end.
It's the little ones.
But the coast here is a total flooding.
Calculate the consumed kerosene to achieve the depredicibilise objective completely..
It's enough to track the list of sponsors like the philanthropes.
An operation like no more done or done.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm waiting for the website with patience!
Your account gives me a look, by identifying me a little by the way (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn in the White Moulin in the vicinity of Brest!).
Chapter also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of movement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep looking at us, and show with enthusiasm that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think that the red fine that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More importantly, I think that local communities and public bodies of any kind should not give up on our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers as sympathical as they are!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, sometimes in the Youth and now in Fenerbachce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac's defense officer, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the '70s and '80s' and had numerous teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has played as an attack on the great team of Velez who, under the protection of legendary Suleman Rebac, has completed twice in the Yugoslav language (and also has been counted as being points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was in the Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Count arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not entitled.
Is there anything else you can do, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're close.
The trick is that the trap of this drone is not the trap of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little overnationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian trap with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country's boats to neighboring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towering around knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How'd you do it?
What keeps me a little bit in this "witness," is that the only thing I could have done would be, once, suddenly enjoying the terrible death of thousands of people, witness to my eyes a "board line" personality which all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Without a doubt, at the short time of "joy," we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror.
We will have just thought, at one time, that for once, Muslims had succeeded in doing real and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his own heart.
It makes qqch powerful.
It's huge.
It would seem that this feeling had been shared by thousands of Muslims driven by their feelings of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfraud.
We had some doubts.
The "Christian/white/gaulois" event cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of man when he is aware of the general poverty, the social and cultural development of the modern Arab world.
I'm talking about cheeseburgers or Algiers, not Dubai Tours.
The past splendler, of course magnificent is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this devilish darkness?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons defy the Arab world: conservativeism is the bigot of local powers and fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thought and communication (slow or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood it before, must not make Muslims retreat.
It's the only way.
Are you sure you want to delete this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long months of nightmares, wet and depressed that affect the well-being and humor of many people.
In addition, everyone falls sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and for those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help with moisture and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath by itself.
Not as much as to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the summer falls a week-end.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grunch that slows down the clichés!
Not all the world.
You're very sick and cold.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of enthusiasts, with a febrile that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of neglect and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these months of sleep and gray make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child abuses , this is the amount owed by the State which is mainly from the 8 to 10 decades .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase to this extent , these are in particular the figures 4 and 5 which are concerned ( average income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the widow's primary concern is not of any treatment in the article or rather of its impact is fully under assessment: 230M of Euros is a pleasure which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and is not indolent.
And it's not ready to arrange.
Well, we're not on the ball right now, but we're dreamers.
Once the PS makes a policy rather left we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are part of the 20 per cent richest must bear much more than 75 per cent of the increase in taxes, why not 90 per cent?
Let us continue this and encourage these 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically right, but I'm telling you at the same time.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled to PS: they have everything.
Adam, you see what you look at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from hiding as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once more than the use of money, money is nothing more than making money, i.e. doing the worst of the greatest number.
It's part of 20% of the richest.
There is no doubt also 20 per cent of the homes that work most (and create the wealth of which a part is reasonably redistribution).
A fair tax must allow these houses to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your hands and live in social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the headcutters at the red chemmer were happy to live.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have been in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves to the reception or face the least.
It's enough to go to someone else's house, sleep in it, run behind yourself and share.
It'll be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of insurance from the owner.
Make sure to use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6h too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" It's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its download, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
At 24 hours after an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made arrangements for it to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is secured, but at the same time).
So why does this article mention Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I love AIRBNB, to receive how to travel
Good morning I'm looking for people who have already used bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay an account and a month's rent, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we?
“ Supporting the troops, ” sang Bu$herie on all tons...
So non-violent weapons.
I'm sure this will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds to halabja to learn that their parents and friends have gone to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain Polish).
Furthermore, in what way would this mass crime in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
The author's style is not so clear: "In the search for weapons of mass destruction.
We're okay.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Option: Is it time to strengthen education, because we are always at war?
A lot of education would already be strengthened if we were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
In time, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And we can't believe teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not because National Education does not have the means to provide a college/lyced office to its students, so they're burning at them.
A type of teletravel forced in cash, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Also, it's so planned at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we don't get to fill the CAPES of maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How did you not want to be caught up in bad-educated jokes that your parents scare you by treating you as lazy?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the djihadites so that the khurde population can better expand.
Where we see that Bush administration has absolutely everything through it.
My first job I graduated was in sales in London three times, but it was a job for which I needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to work for the London Metro, which was paid £5,000 more per year and was not even requested.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, you do not do this if you do not find a well-paid job, try to find something that pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed in the university, I would still have paid my student loan.
I don't like work in the business, so I hope to go through either in public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011, there was already a three-year retirement.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of excessive rows such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, i.e. what is called chommer diplomas.
I've got one of these diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It turned out that the importance was not the degree but, as the article above said, a good professional course, starting at school and all over the university.
Some of the starting wages were lower, but we quickly raised the scales because in the real world, what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has been under way for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in a way that brings results.
The letters, philosophy and art are obsessive lines?
It's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about some kind of media study or whatever the mystery line where you're going.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true lines.
We need people who can explain the great issues to the students, who understand the importance of cultural foundations such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Would it not be a true territorial policy to deport Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I see the inhabitants of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise finals make 80km back every day by train to work in Paris.
Intra-murors and the small town already have many means of transport in common even more practical (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and closed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is channelled by 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris is working with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
To benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a single wheeling device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not gonna work.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of common transport for which they do not agree, it does not seem to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is dangerous hyper with all these valves, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and run from the survival of the vehicles 2/ are carried full of pollution in the head To me, the cycle tracks are short going, it is necessary to reduce the traffic ( urban type of congestion pay), reduce the speed (Paris = area 30), to keep the road code systematically speaking (even the vehicles in front of the beemol that need to adapt the code of the written road to the general
The cycle tracks are of apartheid, but it is necessary to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the Great Paris?
Not a word about the place of the vehicle in common transport?
EELV's right.
The 15% target of traffic is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo threw the greens into the oven.
In addition to learning what OR reports, EELV's supporters seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the rocket starts, it would be better to find out who's really hiding behind this mask.
Indication: this is not Russia.
I'm not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It's like a terrible air.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the matter before the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be settled by waiting for the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 no more.
Malaysia Airlines is not in the wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been attacked, Ukraine launched in the area of air attacks against the rebels and any aircraft could certainly be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with innocent lives so that air companies pay the territorial rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev troops who defend their superpowers / the Western Ukrainian ultranationalists - who want to prove to themselves that Putine defeated the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is going on in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the opposition forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for its actions.
There's no way Russia won't let this case go to the CIA.
It is strange to think that Abbott is saying to Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
Calling Ricardo and being such a boy in echo, it's embarrassing!
It's called Polaire. It's going north. It's exciting.
The only question here is: Is the poverty of today more poor than the poverty of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who are most viciously critical of the book of Piketty haven't read it!
It's easy to read. I've been there for a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, capital property, merit and inheritance in the term log..
It shows that today's concentration of capital combines that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration continues after...
Bernajuzan: You don't want anything.
I ask you how long it took you to read this poem knowing that an individual's concentration capacity has a few limits.
Then, the question is not whether it's easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central theme given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without having to read the book which is essential to argue in favour of it alone.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central theme of his poem summarized by the press false?
I didn't read it and I didn't read it.
So I'm going to sum up his central thesis and that's what I think I'm smoking.
The notion of a difference between rich and poor is subsidizing.
Is humanity not globally rich?
And this wealth added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age in which most people begin to find their place in the world.
I hope this price will not be a burden for the young girl and she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments who want to prove the old touch as to which colored perversities are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular areas of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her so much freedom, but she said that if she wasn't there now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "coloured perverts"?
You should not have any "time to wait" on this site.
You're a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolutionary.
No, his father wasn't going to marry her at 14 years of age.
She was 15 when she was shot up.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receives higher education and that she has the right to decide herself about her marriage.
For this reason, it's something unusual in Pakistan, as far as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl should often get married at 14 years of age without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it in a way that's pretty exciting to you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
It was rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange that apparently has a bit of a bad idea of finding Marlene Dietrich's personality.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best series of horrors, one of the most boring!
A fascinating first episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronic Life on Mars de Bowie is just reverse.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last one for me, without Lange Buff).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have all of a time to look at 13 episodes on 3-4 months.
But one thing is about, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, is the risks of shooting in scenes and mounts that helped me.
The AHS has an original plan avalanche that does not undermine the aseptication of today's production.
That leaves me a little bit to see you drop the sponge in advance for the next few months without even waiting to be able to harvest the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say, though, there are other things.
It's not just for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical quality.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sines by writing, she wants too much to do things at the same time.
The 3 season was slightly below, in the 2nd it was too widespread despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see you doing 10 American Horror Story or it'll end like 24 hours of time.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say "I won't look any more" that everyone is obliged to do so!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she's gonna kill him.
But then, here's my opinion.
Let's talk less tax rates, please - cut down on state spending.
No, let's increase the costs, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenditure failed.
Deployment of polemics on relatively small expenditure items such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government expenditure in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about sounds rather than a change of direction that voters seem to call their voices and during all this time, in each camp, they seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see clearly in their game and find them with bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not have had any problem with the government coming up with a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be useful.
But this is not the case, and many contributors feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, aid to near-use elephants and nuclear power stations that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem very ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with $50,000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200 000 pays about $70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car vineyard.
I've been paid decently, but not extravagance.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But we don't seem to believe that money falls from heaven or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books are coming from.
How can a trucker looking for work at the port can prove it?
At the same time, 20% of the lodgers wouldn't look for it, which means that 80% are looking and they don't find it.
As a homosexual myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of becoming a author.
In fact, I haven't had any news from Paule Employment since months, which means that the agents are more busy with control operations than actually making job announcements?
I don't see any interest in it.
Because it's not for the State to provide work.
If Poland Employment doesn't provide enough jobs, then you have to move from Poland Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, as soon as we make sure that the unemployed are well satisfied with their duties in the face of their rights.
As a controller asks for their transport to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are paid for their work, etc.
No one calls the scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Paule Jobi, my rights to the ARE were badly established, and on one of the cases, 40% amputated, there was a firm battle.
That takes time!
I'm not a legal expert.
The record and control are currently taking place, while the Statutory Paule Jobi is close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only employees, those who pay the costs.
Non-Salary politicians and French are granted rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that unemployment insurance is an important part of the evaluation of paid work.
More than waiting for Arab killers...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of the population at that time.
The Saudis had the intention of banning Hadj to Mecca this year from three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application rejected because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a miner coming from Bosnia who contracted the virus to Mecque during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a miner coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it not true that it is only to propose to prevent Ebola's patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just good sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days after treatment with patients before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola virus while they're out there, they stay there until they're cured.
There are no dragonian measures.
Nothing but last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We forbid them to offer their will to these countries.
Furthermore, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with Ebola's typical symptoms so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
It is possible to pass the message of the first individual and of the second group (including religious) and it will merit the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt it will be possible to irradiate the image of God characterized by the entire cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still far from this concept there.
This is only 20 years ago that information appeared as mankind's first data, while religion, out of the brain, has been leading our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the interest in becoming the first Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize them would not put their feet in the Church in any way, there is no need to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the concept of sin, too "anciogene"?
@Louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision in France.
And in the world, it may be that will allow you to touch more of the world...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it was pre-existing in Christ.
One century before he had said, "Don't do to anyone else what you don't want us to do, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agpe.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but not God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection will be removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who violated moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were then exterminated and forced into immigration several centuries ago.
I'm too busy buying this, the new alien game, or Westeland 2.
And the new Elite game soon comes.
It didn't happen.
I would personally choose SoM.
I love Westeland 2 (I even participated in its fund-raising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll see.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the IT department block all the sympathetic sites.
Hello, is it £30 and 20% reduction, or is it £30 including 20% reduction?
However, note: PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the mirror*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Cavaat conmptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they will damage your library if they decide to take advantage of the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.
So join Elite's beta version: Dangerous.
So, was France of 1940 a "poof land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize has all the air of a gift that I've been charged with.
Do you need to love France of 40, that of "the missing stranger"?
When we see who gets the Nobel of literature we ask whether Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the primary authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians are going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I am quite sure.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a far-reaching relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
That would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They would appreciate Mr.
Modiano's fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to enjoy Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso preserve all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel of literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, you're welcome.
Since I've been driving one in Iceland, I don't stop seeing the Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this call followed me to this point.
Maybe she wants to exaggerate me?
You gonna judge me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate it?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I've taken my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
The last weekend I went to the feast at Nottingham's beer and cider.
It was boring.
I've been able to enjoy 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people down there, there were only Camra fanatics (not to coincide with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the Grandfather of a bag to play the baby card brag.
Thanks to a real start-up chance, I was able to share with several decades.
I hope if I'm 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Yesterday night I went to a cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a top cut.
I admire M.
Read some Buddha and you will understand how you make a mistake, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're going to get away with it a little bit.
This famous total, it prohibits searches for the Djihadists on the exit of the mosques.
She's not late for arms traffic.
Whether we have big eyes like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
This is not by keeping our eyes closed to the light.
I'm sorry, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental contradiction: the whole of the authorities, organizations or associations representing, Muslim or non-Muslims, who have formally condemned the IE and its crimes, the French, Muslim or non-Muslims, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
That's not a word to say.
The problem is that people like you see them first like Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is a doubt for the whole world.
As I said thousands of times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and inappropriate to accuse them of priori and demand that they publicly prove to the rest of French society that they have failed to question them.
This principle is in my view the rejection of the Republic and can only contribute to the detachment of French society.
If there's no doubt, tell him.
Who says they don't agree, but they agree to what?
They agree to a close relationship with the EI or to the II’s conviction.
The silence is very practical, is the main weapon of those who want to control the head and the choice.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmaticly unreasonable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Ecosse could, at the elections, "get away" from the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their decentralization proposals and what they promised to protect the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be fed up to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron's got to get rid of laughs.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely wrong about Ecosse because they have no seat.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I do not think that even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the work losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna throw a alarm for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and the UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
And Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking he was saving his part but without realizing that he meant the death penalty for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labourlist Members are asking for accounts from their manager.
If SNP receives 20-25 seats and has no majority in Parliament, even if seats do not come from Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have promised for a maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather important.
Not if the Work or Conservatives want to be renewed one day in England.
Turning the 8% pumps down to 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish Members are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it's okay.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in position to be the prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in large measure, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he's reading, how he's sleeping, and up to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
The same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures VOTRE free of charge by VOTRE profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay like the world.
Very stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have access to Pirate files, books from the public domain or purchased with some editors who have the intelligence to offer files without muchard.
I see the price I paid the Kobo, it's no regret.
I am aware of the generalized training of users in the face of the generalized adaptation of their private life.
In your big public library, you will note systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding executive heads whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly expensive.
For example, James Joyce’s finalegens Wake.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The harvest isn't anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo which are not allowed to identify either the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government these last days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherly schizophrenic strains under acid.
It is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan's party thinks Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to take a ball in its foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will return, so it's actually pulling a ball in her foot.
A diplomat wrote on his blog on retirement: "The AP reports that Iran has kept the United States safe and that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because this would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran had sent a serious warning of them or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, really surprising is today's Iranian and American diplomatic commitment to Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The publication of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone paying attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by traditional media. The short article that you are giving the link is important and should be read in mind by keeping in mind the realistic observations/pre-warning warnings coming from Iran on a proposal from Afghanistan about 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the terrible Laic Assad and at the same time are the perverts of ISIS?
The pipeline policy moves the world to the bottom, and I would suggest that those who refer to “moderate” who do not have to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to battle in World War III.
"It's even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism." Is there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in my head.
There should be a Nuremberg process for Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should he "need" ?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my bag...
Would the criminals not be old-fashioned now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly with regard to CUP triumvirat that planned and directed genocide, Talat and Djemaal were killed just after World War I by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by Bolsheviks in a forested area of Central Asia near the same time, when he went to the brink of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delight!
An impressive master of the sophism of the deadly pen, but on the other hand, we are looking for contact with the real.
Which clicks without argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart that beats even into the belly of a pregnant mother.
The lesbian couples can simply be a child's wish and not a wish to be accepted.
The heterogeneous couples, too.
About the kids!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to win their life, and to pay for the woman's retirement (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine known to our world.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have taken and placed children in the world who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, are cosmetics not they also marketing bodies? !
Anakronic Colour Unit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to push its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century close to home without shouting it at this time on all of you! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who reject these practices ...
There is nothing less than the use of bodies as a real problem.
Oh, you guys, this guy's passionate about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I've only seen it far away.
I had to go there the other day because I didn't have the right to go there tonight!
But if you like this and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many embarrassing comments about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I think there's an article on the football that's waiting for your comments in the sports section.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
Not surprisingly that Paul Mason had taken the social and political context well, he understood things well.
Northern alone is still alive, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This said, you can get an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass solo wines, including full of Northern Soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a small article that was written and thought well.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have escaped to Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
Taking pills.
What the train before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes on Wigan's feet after buying a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern alone scene are described in an excellent episode of the series of police George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
The business becomes more and more exciting.
The Palestinians don't have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to take care of-colonizers (also, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He washes his clothes, puts them on the rock and enters the water.
An Israelite had stolen them from him.
The representative of Israel was angry and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiles and adds: and now that things are clearly established

That this shift to the ancient Israelites is evidence, that is not the purpose sought ...
Antithionist: But I have responded to you, I have translated: the global geopolitical report ...

In the Israeli-colonianist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it will be lost!
For the creation of Israel do not answer you.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Virusist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
You doubt ??!!!! ...
In addition, it doesn't only turn around Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists have to have the wrong to go beyond whatever he has to say.
Many of what he says are just some pseudo-chomskys written by others.
That's who proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves well, which would mean it's an issue of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of conscience that Russell Brand says certain truths, may be truths that we prefer not to think about.
Upstairs, this feeling will be more intense!
I can understand why Brand has some horrors: he sometimes speaks out in a pretentious way, and after all the absurdities of the tablets he actually gives the impression of being a starting populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their hands and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he says to vote once every 5 years only for the Labour or Conservatives (or the Democrats I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (at a slightly different level) are essentially in favour of private interests, multinational companies and rich, at no time it is said to ignore completely the policy because these parties do not rule on their own behalf, and instead try to stop them from voting on their behalf.
I do not say that I must agree with its solution (because I think that being politically active can go along with voting, since politicians are politicians who will change their opinion if they are really at risk of losing the elections), but it's a pleasure to see all these condolences that say that this foolish one who makes Jesus tells young people not to take the penalty for voting and just hope that everything will be better because it is really to distort his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial and this would be good if people were to debate what it really said rather than simply label it as irresponsible and to ignore its concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting call has been completely distorted.
The inefficiency of swallowing a bullet in a urine every 5 years makes me deeply angry because my vote really doesn't matter for anything.
I want more referendums, e-vote, direct democracy and Members who are accountable locally to their voters.
In addition, I answer the idea that Russell Brand's issues are not seismic (written by others).
It is smart enough to have its own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-stabilistic university students who would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskys bilevated".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne makes like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head shakes on the mount!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up being one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
Then in a political speech that has existed since generations but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - since generations.
This "fronde" is especially evident to me that intellectual debate has not been held in the history's RTVs since then, where medieval historians have become minority and where the trades of specialists have appeared for the benefit of borrowing-to-thinked sciences Po type for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take it to a couple, an emissary mouth.
They develop one another's very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these emitting lips that are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that Foucault's state was essential as a couple.
This is due to a very archaic thought, the self-sacrifice thought, which is also the magical thought.
There is a solution to the problem of the relationship with the other in the elimination process.
There is an archipelago, neo-lib and /or liberator (from two terms the second mark a delay in the state's desire to eradicate the state , the first known to go looking for State aid for its markets ) within the meaning of at least one state / not all state aid at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is well organized.
Its view is based on the state's guilt: without this liability it does not have any cause.
He who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
No other support.
The total left recalls the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have no doubt read a very fast crya if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an Apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer be able to attack Michel this way...
Gauchet gives a deep thought to the contemporary and collective individual, about the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectful thinker.
See this cable orchestrated by researchers in human sciences on the left of the hard left who are not suffering from allegation to their minds, it is quite likely.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the post of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "young" who I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't like to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember seeing a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia - the last time in the 1990s, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after the arrival of Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violent anti-Blancs.
My father is not happy that his aged daughter comes with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially during the past few years: they are more rich, prosperity spread out of large cities, and this prosperity makes people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians have been particularly prejudiced against temporary workers without original qualifications in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in meteries and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I have lived on the rivers of the Inesei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard Australians' opinions on Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really strange that a stranger tells me I don't support the Chinese, while I met two people in my life (including one abroad), I didn't keep bad memories, everyone gets stronger and, in fact, those in London have been very kind is the only reason I remember being Chinese.
But we don't remember who we're going to meet, everyone gets stronger, how to remember who we were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're always out with Ledit Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with whites, compared?
No, because there's a lot of chance that these Whites' parents would attack them physique.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the wars and justice in France that remain manipulated by groups marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the courts are frankly marked by right.
When it comes to the Syndicat of the Magistrate, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its particleity can be taken from the relevance of the application of the laws in the courts, it shall remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the actual interpretation of the Magistrate.
There is therefore the legally required tool for refocusing the evaluation on the basics.
The measure of non-observance in all judicial acts of judges, including parquets, requires a distinction between the error and the partiality of the judges.
It would be wrong to assume that justice acts do not divide between these three groups.
The claim and ignorance are not relevant for objective analysis.
So if all of this is not analysed, how can we say that justice improves in France?
If that's not just by statistics, it's actually very low.
The previous preample allows you to record well what follows in the third ratio.
Those of corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is attributed to the judicial institution capable of such a hierarchy.
The area considered is that of the exploration* of inheritances committed up to the means of infringements to the procedure* by successive geneticists designated by non- Notaries.
This profession receives EUR 150 million in good year, while benefiting from coverage* provided by almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
To understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this Joint Statistical Improvement* is moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between geneticist and relative heirs, a set of jurisdictions which is contrary to all the laws that favour the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignores such rational criteria, then, a form of lie?
Must be totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment for the arrest of the disabled.
This can be said, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the country, built to measure his size and weight and has really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a wheelchair running normal, with rolling wheels and tires, he could not.
As we say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair in the air EPIQUE.
I don't think Whill's inventor ever had to clean a dog hole on a chain.
I'm sure my sister would worship the tricycle all over the country, but it's just too expensive.
The long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard pen.
There are hills here that would like them.
The prices seem to be actually high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bicycle, so "you see".
The tricycle all over the country seems especially useful to me.
Not all persons with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance.
Only if they've become disabled.
The trick is that the rolling stock market is a nest, so they can practice high prices for things they know they deserve us.
We can't really say that Whill is a minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a mistake, it's not intended to make it.
I am aware that the failure to run "long distance" does not occur on the market, because there seems to be no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombings in densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their lives under Israeli blockades!
The only situation in the world, unacceptable situation, also illegal situation, as this blockade affects "collective punishment" for all Gazans.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Oh, this isn't the language of wood instead of concrete and armying the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Semiticist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's a black market there's some, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been imprisoned in the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
The only situation in the world, unacceptable to anyone who has a heart and a sense of morality.
The United States has a well preserved area: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whoever you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that after he got up, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a West, so I'm trying to prove...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egypt...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress built against the people who chose their wives!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the share economy, without any profit.
Many are only looking for a couple of nights on Cuchsurfing.
So it is to pay (or at least expect it) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are trusted often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in species, including Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does it put on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the word "your letter" in the United States.
The author just used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, where you wouldn't have noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it's 100% in line with all security rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to allow it to carry out commercial activities (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to rent (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it's really a shelter...
Did you think that ships could be moved, stolen and repatriated, stolen, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to fly it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or turned off by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going?
No Marine Le Pen has no reason!
We're popping up?
There is no truth but that of him who reveals the truth!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the table will say!
Capitalism won't open up!
The high financial, special, play with our companies, so our jobs, our primary materials, our purchases, our food, our health care structures, our debt and our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All of this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the cold.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is money."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Minister of Economy an old bank of Rothschild, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else to compete?
You call this how: return his clothes, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to save survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed to be certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cure in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun set, making all rescue operations more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Maluunas, where, on the photos showing survivors while safe, we see a calm and full-day sea.
Furthermore, the rescuers knew there were no German fighters in the area at this time.
Hmm, that's not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick research on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion prevailed among the German ships as to the fate of the two healed cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped shooting, and a race began.
Leipzig lives something in the fire, but by approaching him he lives that it was just an epileptic.
Nürnberg, less slow than other German ships, join the battle late and live the Monmouth, thought and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing out his projectors on the ship's deck, the proposal to return was rejected and opened fire, finally closing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee thought that the Good Hope had to escape and stop searching at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports indicating a British cure in the environment, it headed north. ”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had landed, and therefore could not find survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cure for the Royal Navy in the area that would have seriously damaged them, so they were confused to benefit from their progress.
They were far from their base, and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them torture and had cost about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes attend the UMP in order to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election be definitely illegal.
Here's a brave position, which would also touch the left-hand side.
But noon, it's a joke.
I'm proposing an inscription at the death of the Magistrates Cons.
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Maintained by policy cards (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to love those who will benefit from their immovability to prevent the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose real estate is to their own extent.
I met them in the metro in the afternoon with their little pancards for justice" they came from the province and did not make any difference between Bercy and the PUB.
It supports the existence of political unionists whose members have enormous power to hold the service of their part.
It would not defend the same thesis if right unions, i.e. extremely right-wing, were designated for the personality of its board and were led to a legal-media war.
Your claims are totally free.
Yes, currently the right reflects the judiciary's fact that it has simply done the facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of left-wing personality that had so much to do with justice, but all those who had been the subject of his attention had not been treated favourably.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the union of the left is not the only union of judges and that it is minority.
That a minister of support with such commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you call may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in Chancellery, it is not a secret.
It is now asked whether the "mission" of certain judges is not much more to go out than to teach.
@gos - You should be satisfied, SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not officials like others: they are the only ones to have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waisssel.
I believe that even the most famous weakness of glory realizes that X-factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many are used as a trap to start a successful career.
The One Directorate completes the world-wide stadiums.
Others have then sold a lot of disks or are part of the West End.
Popstars, the predecessor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in Eurovision, as many others.
While others, such as Frank Sinatra and the rest, participated in United States competitions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into the dark.
But this is what happens in any way to most stars who do not participate in the competition.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing it for others.
In any case, most of the singers/groups can best expect three albums and one of the best.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity is part of his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to embark on a career than the typical rock road, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar farmers who smoke the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a high school level will certainly become stars and the only question is how they want to touch before they even get out of an album.
And rather than ridiculous: it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns into racism, because sacrilist ethnologists present us as far away from us as supersistic infinity and ritual biotriums, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, such as ours, to our daily considerations.
Unless you're imprudently interpreted in reverse terms.
Or, but rather than saying that the tomb is damaged by a sacred character, should it not be better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières have not a very sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing sacred as a sort of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
It's a very interesting article whatever it is.
It's the ephemeral deco to make the empty.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrated figures in the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of holiness is always alive.
Who else believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would be passed on to the orientals of the interpretations of not all scientists who live a mandarin, rarely less.
When's a comparison of disciplines for a little bit?
Because what is important for archeology is also important for interpretations that give other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of health modesty.
Your hatred for the archaeologists is really unfair!
It is thanks to them that they constantly discover treasures, precious testimony to restore history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is fascinating.
This method is not very ancient and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and they could deceive themselves.
Today there are such technical and scientific means that the interpretation of follicles is better but can still be returned because of other discoveries!
It is there full (and old) polemic about the chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (with its book "The Prehistoric Appeals", in particular the increased re-editation of scientific controversy, based on the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this article very much instructive
Heteros men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could use it.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This journal is meant to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a piece of theater up there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there in reverse, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment on your part.
We'd say Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost over, I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a journal that pays for real journalists, courageous, so that they write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and losses.
It's more than getting rid of these pig-and-goose blonds.
Not very bad.
Come on, then.
If you're so shocked by these "puary balls," you're not obliged to participate, are you?
You also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is really possible to do both and publish an article on the annual sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people regulate it?
Nevertheless, we find the lover video of crash on the net...
The love video of crash on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case from the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or another vehicle (for example, depanner) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhon we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM didn't think it was good to move the time of departure (telephone, pub, money...).
But on the other hand, they protect the pilots.
Good to see you. I share this opinion too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM does enter the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that then...
You're leaving on this blog my sister Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to waste all your c**** laughs.
No, not really.
There have been conspiracies in F1, but never one who would risk death Commissioners for a long story of the possibility of defeating one pilot to the destruction of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of security because it's the FIA.
It's size news.
In view of amateur images, the absence of image allows the FIA to avoid the ghastly questions of the type: How does the Commissioner act in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is judged too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because it is clearly seen as one of the Commissioners acting on a green tape, it indicates that the course can normally resume and that it is more under yellow tape.
Some comments show a shadow of F1's meconaness.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow strip APRES the place of the accident, where the green cloth acts.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of the Commissioners is just below the accident (in any case, it can be 10 metres like 100 meters after the accident) agglomerated the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal departure.
Sensitivity sells people.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I was very afraid that, in the end, it was just for money.
And sex, we don't forget sex, fear of having no sexual life, pub and media are good for us to sell things that are intended to improve our sexual life.
The information is exactly the same.
Making the bug with information that we don't really need to worry about is right to continue to scare people so they can continue to control them.
"When the tablets touch about Ebola, we draw all the fear "It should be "draging", not "stitching".
In view of the medical reference, “all” is better said in this context than “slow down”.
I wonder if all those who claim that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confused with Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concious article that radically and firmly ridicules this pseudo-journalism object.
It's been very good for me.
I feel that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism in the world.
The goal is once again to keep us tired and tired enough (without reaching the hysteria) for the government can discourage us when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to rise to a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attention, why don't we have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any case?
This government seems to be trying to save us from crises that he himself invented.
Is there anything fundamentally problem with the idea of being ruled by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning, this had to be terrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm blue, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Witnessing perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the witnesses serve nothing: they are taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a bad influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: Evidence cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be because we avoid asking questions to patients in psychiatric care when there are reliable observations from close relatives.
My psychiatric file says my mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her beautiful mother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's the mistake, it's a subjective witness of no importance.
Ah, because the testimony of a fact (= here is this evidence, which testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing in a scientific way?
So what are you looking for?
On ghosts?
Do you have the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= presenting verifiable evidence)?
'Resilience': the word bidon given by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take for great psychologists after reading from D'Ansemburg.
@Jim: There are many empty buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik has struck us with the "resilience".
As it is a great scientist, Cyrilnik, I hope that he will block us from a reliable scale of measure for quantification, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Don't you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
So why?
It was a great series and it would be said that those who come out of it have a conscience!
So let us leave our health to the most powerful one who can do miracles.
But how are they gonna make children grow up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humour type of pipe-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The children were growing up.
Oh, because it's a series for children?
The UKIP works for the Misterons.
So keep your American team.
Always in Supermarion?
This will not be the same if we don't see the children and that the animation is well done. :-)
I've been looking forward to seeing this (though an adult), but I hope this will give the idea to a channel to re-distribute the old.
The series has almost never ceased to be published here in Australia; this means at least 40 years we have episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06 p.m.
Since the arrival of the free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition to half an hour, the episodes are now on Monday to Friday at 5:30 p.m.!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "dear" guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mountain of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all the Israeli caves down and around the forest of spranadas for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists there is another.
Can it be Argentina?
This mountain is not searched for for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque floor has been built.
Its summit, or dome of Rocher, makes its way into Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is raised to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Moriah the mount where Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the time it was taken and contextualized, there was no propaganda, but information, cher K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember them regularly, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, had accepted the plan to 2 states, and has continued to do so!).
It is also good to show how far the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his feelings?
The shortest of the Jewish bricks: "God be praised!"
In order to benefit from tourism in Israel, we are often shown young babies half-dwelling on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what we show advertising, as we can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
That makes me a little scared at the same time.
And this photo is a great campaign work!
The damage that the photographer of Reuters did not take in photos of hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who preferred to hide the faithful Jews in contraband, praying to the wall of mourning.
@Matt, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in misery.
The only way to end this system is by revolution.
Since the economy seems to be on the rise, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they had the opportunity to have a job and that they could not afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave more and more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You're right, that's not easy, but it'll change in this country only when workers really speak one voice.
Instead of looking and laughing when someone else does strike, support them, evidence of some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems but also about your employer that people are not being punished.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case yes, it is possible.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the best.
For example, China and India.
This can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy because it's what it's been.
Did you vote for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (ICTI) aims to increase the benefits of companies held by these people in short circuits by national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is to be used.
The Greens are against this project and try to warn people about the unprecedented damage that this agreement will have to do with our lives.
This is just what we've just started to talk about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your dose.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sister and tears"?
That's what makes excellent damages, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low mile will certainly be the car market.
This gentleman was right, at XVIII there were unions in all regimes.
In the very French Catholic army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let him (end, his officers, others, nobody knows anything) believe in the safer of the eternal values of France, and she will beat and close her throat.
And then with the country's decline, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, short: the dissoluteness of the idea of the Nation, having this small remnant, is comforting.
Even if for her it's even more unpleasant...
You still lack the union of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm going to sign it.
You've been prevented. It'll be your fault.
In order to defend the category interests, there are already enough protected professions of unionists, which has created a division of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the risk of a member of the staff member.
We can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right of strike as in Germany, in contrast to the protection they enjoy.
Not a safe disaster.
And with the charters that are prepared, the government is happy.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance in effect...
Illusion for Ignorance Sybile I gave an allusion to the military and other officers, as this is the subject mentioned here...
Deletes "by means of its delegates" in Article 8 of the 1946 Constitution.
He will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the interruption of the intelligence power.
And yet you have opened it, probably then comment on a specific article entitled "The Great British Back Off Review". ??????????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought he had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some people have been well murdered.
In Joffrey's marriage episode we have one of the best moments (which was the wine) in television history.
Also, from the tarte mmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of affiliation that, strangely, the issue ends with a winner of the least bulging ; no one has done this kind of "boom, here's my shitty shit now kiss it and hang it in front of your master!"
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents out there finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept separate.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I can influence that.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great fun and motivate us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree that the last challenge of last year, the wedding present, was absurd.
Professionals usually set up days to do them and should cycle at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to run, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis's home, the only real mistake they had to find was that the base was a bit dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that Richard's green ice cream didn't give up, somehow Richard had already lost it at that time).
I must warn that several challenges in this series appear to be artificial because of the time spent.
There is also cancer that looks, with solar winds cut.
Certainly, we all succeed at this point.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You're confused with solar winds and ultraviolet rays.
The UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is precisely formed by the impact of residual solar particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field had weakened, there would not be enough solar air to "shade" the stratospheric ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block the UVs.
They have a number of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man, they are interested in enabling us to have os (vitamin D synthesis), heat us (less than infrarous), modulate our immune system, and it seems to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be a successor and to consider your interlocutor as a survivor when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was heard in the comment, which he himself is willing to prove of pedagogy.
Without saying I'm a melanoma habit, the UV only make it easier for its development.
They don't provoke him.
To prove: not all people who are bronchos have no melanomas.
I mean, when a tube tells you that it needs to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because UVs are necessary for everyone.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
The UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we hit him?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested have found that everything can be wasted if there is sufficient force and iPhone 6's robustness is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as first-line communications material.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have found that everything can be blown if there is sufficient force.
Safe and Nokia 3310.
More specifically, has it already been washed?
This bill is made in each discussion.
I've decided to count on them.
It's the fourth blog on the page I've read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can see how wrong it might be.
So, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been correctly installed and which is therefore compatible with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these tricks.
But would they put testing software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or EC logos and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo by excellence.
We want low-cost products and it is surprising that industry produces 'industrials' We put first super or even small-scale teaching and even small trade are related How to buffer well, bio avac 1650€ (medium wage in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he understands it.
For me food is one.
Get out of here, I'll hug you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that forces them to connect with reality.
It's the total degrouping thought-relevant.
They are gesticulating experts, for example they claim to save the planet because they refused to take a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, combining the left-caviar, which they are sometimes above, for example by condemning CO2 withdrawals while on vacation in Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not suffer this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferia, nor are they surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the details associated (air, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecoles are monoblocks.
Do you understand the concept of the left-hand side?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological dance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the schools in the short run.
The boboecolo is actually part of it, but it is only the most visible break of the schools because it is the one who infects the media.
That's a nice giraffe.
Looks like nobody wants to see this giraffe in the face.
She's so bad that she looks vaguely like a naked woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flaunting large artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and seems to be always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really succeeded in becoming very rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
Well, that's from *l'art*.
No, it's from the car.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
It's an opinion instead.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are real-time dog reproductions that smoke by playing billard.
To judge art may be a problem, but not in this case.
Drawing, it's much more than simply representing the real.
If you're looking for that, a camera will do it.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is more to do with economies: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican guard or the status of generals who are no longer active....
L(Hunity) requires France to reduce its effectiveness, but, as all countries have done, sometimes more drasticly, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operator does not support it, it quickly finds its limits!
A single approach, when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, in particular Sahel.
A bad break for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, is part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: that's what I said, look where to make savings but especially not at me, at me it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, see where the gobeg is certain.
That all those who had little or enough of the military thing come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money spent in this perimeter and this without a smile...
That the same power is applied throughout the public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really heavy: look at the inflation of public employment in other departments and you understand why The Defence may be a little charged!
Well, the economies in which the whole world agrees to say it needs to be done, right?
Lack of power, those on whom it falls are due to murder when it comes to them, the poor are in love.
This should be done, but above all, because in this case it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
To close the Grace Val will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
As for the local communities, history is repeated at each post closure, maternity, hospital, casino.
But the world is for the economies that are well understood.
It is strange, a major UMP that wants compensation and does not enjoy savings in public expenditure.
This article is really the most exciting trick I've ever read!
It's a time when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the depression of making his son defies Facebook and seeing that 80 percent of his friends began their status by the phrase "This moment is boring".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone fell by his ex on his bus while going to work and only finds out where his pocket is back in his cult.
It's not pregnant, it's completely with you.
In fact, I think the author takes the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to stir his emotions and close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to scene after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a fight to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible trick I've ever read!
Charlie really came to prove that he's everything at the top of the cosmic universe that's satirical journalism!
I'm down to the back of it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brightness and the insurgent genius that shines on Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine hole.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if it's not women or clothes.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive change in democracy: the number of regional policies and effective associated initiatives.
Until the new order, we will have the right to save our planet by States that play tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take things into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations were involved ....
Translation: Sunflowers and sunflowers are the Round points tomorrow.
All funded by the Con-Trade.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much worse at the level of its losses and in case of an accident.
As long as the line is not mastered in its integrity, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only health, provided that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
The electricity by renewable oil or PV is already more than GES on other steps, especially gas, or coal as in Germany, to compensate for interference.
Replacement of nuclear power by renewable oil or PV would be contrary to the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you. I'm a doctor of state in physical science 1981 more research into nuclear physics I'm trying to prove it against what I said.
For what I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all the people I've never done.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current programme of renewables in Germany is a non-profit and ineffective way to reduce GES emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count on the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour of gas for less effect than CO2, it really reminds the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water and a little bit of water in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian genius"!!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments do not want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it clearly shows your state of mind.
This would have been the case if they had qualified the South Asian Giant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandore box full of corruption and mafiosio.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was particularly interesting, the Kolkata Athletico imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of roads to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how can we one day compete with our "nursing neighbors"...
The race at low cost pays cash.
The damage to such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of any design is evident only with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but in implementation...
contrary to arianespace which is a private society, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as this state is its own insurance..
They may pay for satellites in frigates who know..
This is much more vague than many media take the only titles of articles -- and that many readers think only of these titles.
In general, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In fact, it is not appropriate to agree with you that the title is not appropriate. It is wrong to cause the project while it is only a problem of launching.
