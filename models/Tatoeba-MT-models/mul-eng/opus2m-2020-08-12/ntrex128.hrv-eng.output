Big social representatives are worried that "they'll look like Muppeti"
Some members of the Assembly Member (AM) rejected the proposal so that they could be called Members of the Parliament (MWP).
So far it has been because of the plans for the Assembly to be renamed into the Grand Parliament.
The members of the House of Representatives from all political spheres are concerned that they could become a subject of abuse.
A social representative from the Laborist Party stated that his group was concerned about "remote with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on a large twp means stupid, and pwp pictures.
The group was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A large conservative said his group was "open" to change its name, but that MWP in speech can quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the expression "u" in the Irish English.
The Committee on Social Affairs, which is currently preparing the Law on the introduction of a change of name, announced: "Of course the final decision will be entitled to be on their own."
The Wales government Act of 2017 granted the Grand Assembly authority to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of the public consultation on proposals that have been found in broad support for the change in the name of the assembly in the Grand Parliament.
When it was about what would be called the Assembly's representatives, the Committee was calling "members of the Grand Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the highest support during the public consultation.
The House's representatives propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus could lead to a better way of bringing together the President of the House of Elin Jones than is expected to submit a proposal for a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way of the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of Assembly representatives and the establishment of the Committee's system.
During the discussion of the law of the Assembly, there will be a vote on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians are going out to a referendum on the change in country names
The voters will vote on this Sunday whether they want to change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multiannual dispute with a neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbours represents its own Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its accession procedure to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an anti-plebistic opposition to a change of name, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
However, the rapporteur, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argues that the change in the name is a simple price that must be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The sound of St. Martin was silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I talked to said that in the past he could find a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No one else today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are friends today in a different way," he said.
"Barons no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly live."
When it comes to the churches, it is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "first or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that the churches could replace state buildings with dwellings where people will live who will not help the other churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "that is why the day will come when the churches will completely close them because it is unlikely that the inhabitants who have settled in these buildings will become members of those churches."
Both churches built the white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — the Metropolitan Community 1870 church, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodological Congregation was settled in the 1930s.
The black congregation that maintained the worship of neighboring gods acquired property over the building.
St. Martin's church took over a black congregation with former John Howard Johnson on his head, which led a boy trader on a small 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but since the jealous of the great Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a low sound, called carillon.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and heir to St. Martin, proudly called Carlon "the voices of the poor people".
The artist who played the carillon in Serbia used another name: "cultural goods" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a professor at Michigan University, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to play black singer Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing for 18 years on a major carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story of architects and construction workers, some of whom brought relief to church leaders and other episcopal children.
Sacristia, the leading body of the teeth made up of laika, wrote children in Serbia because of the concern that children would "try to transfer expenses" to the sacrature, although the sacrature was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers who sent children.
Some jubilants complained about lack of transparency on the part of children.
The sea lion injured 13-year-olds during the birth of the Jastos in California
According to the official report, the marine dog attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on the day of opening the fishing season in California.
An attack occurred before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel announced to become KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour and a half in the morning when he heard the boys call for help and then took the group to the scene to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement about the catchment, but then he realized he shouted, “I’m scared!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was broken.
"I was hoping everyone would get out of the water: 'In the water is a sea dog!' Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by a helicopter to a child's Rady hospital in San Diego and still in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain of the Lary Giles rescue team said at a press conference that the marine dog was caught in this area a few weeks earlier, but it was confirmed that it was not a matter of a dangerous type of marine dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablada to Swami in Ecinitas to carry out the search and security of buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry into the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for Lanterns such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic pipes into slave houses and hire specialised sellers.
As a result of a large market entry into the UK’s beauty, worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow in line with the decline in sales of clothing and household equipment, large cosmetic pipes will be tested in 11 countries across the country and expanded to additional trades next year if they are shown to be successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets are trying to use space on police stations that were once provided for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
The representatives of Sainsbury’s company said they would double the size of cosmetic products on 3000 products, including first-time and slave brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing ranger of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain slave brands like Boots.
The Supermarket once again re-starts itssortment of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegetables, and that's what young buyers are looking for.
In addition, the trader of perfumes Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network purchases and return to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local food stores mean that supermarkets have to work more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Chief Director of Sainsbury’s, said that it will take more and more to look like a slave house while this supermarket chain strives to meet the satisfaction of trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering a large number of services and non-preservative products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlet Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, which strongly motivated the sale of live food and made this adjudication more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
By the beginning of 2000, Sainsbury’s entered a joint meeting with Boots, but it ended up fighting about the income from the doctor in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business in 281 Celesia, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by setting up an assortment of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and direction of our cosmetics departments in order to provide our users with a more comfortable environment.
We also put on a special team training that will be at the hands of the buyers and give them advice.
Our range of goods brands is designed to meet all needs, and attractive environment and availability means that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changing old shopping habits."
Peter Jones was "heavy" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds
The Dragon's Den Peter Jones show star left to "heavy cook" after TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds with his slave brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their slave brand of home clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their slave brand is compared with the slave brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The director of this Morning (37) show at Instagram announced that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragon's De Peter Jones show to cook out of anger by getting out of the joint profit business in order to focus on its own new excellent contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source claims that Jones was "heavy" when a gold girl on television during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the seat of his business kingdom in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts are worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meaning there is no time to devote themselves to their slave brand of home clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
This job was compared to the slave brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced at Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source stated: “Truly was one of Holly’s greatest priorities.
This should be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw everything was involved in that job.
No one could believe what's going on Tuesday so close to moving the whole line.
In Marlow's warehouse is a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning's emission leader, one of the most cost-effective stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from wool and candles to clothing and household clothing and possible additional delay in the start of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long - term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were ten years of close friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend their vacation together and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of Slave Marks for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as Head of ITV Emissions I’m and celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard talks, and then we fell in love.
He was amazed at the criticism that would be received in the newspapers because of a comment that some might consider as "undeserved president" and because he has such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leadership.
"Why did President Trump give so much attention?"
said Trump, echoing the voice of the leader of the news.
"I didn't give any excuses."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first of their meetings in Singapore in June called for a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were closed.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore in June on Saturday, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice the "appropriate response" of the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead of that U.S., he has not yet removed the sanctions whose purpose is to further pressure.
In his speech, the trumpet took on a much more optimistic attitude.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"He welcomed us to the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim has had positive results – a halt to the attempts to launch rockets, help with the release of hostages and the return of other American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and floods in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the attack on Lombok by foreign non-governmental organizations, it was said that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka's population has grown, no national disaster has been announced, which is provided for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international help, so this is a bit problematic," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is composed of a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the side of staff will be able to work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to join in the relief effort.
Given the continued support of soil in Indonesia, this country is still unfortunately not prepared to bear with anger.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Acehu, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of siren for warning on cuins in Palu, although the warning was in force, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
And the best time to travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters add to the problem of logistics.
The hospital's ship that was in Lombok for the care of the victims of traffic accidents is in Palu, but it takes at least three days to get to the new disaster site.
The improvement of the Indonesian-distributed structure was the basis of the election campaign of President Jokoa Vidodo and was heavily invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Jokom is fighting the lack of financial resources, and new elections are held next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets of swords, spears and rifles and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge killed the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat on Saturday in the Premier match against Chelsea at 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqirija while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea naked as a result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he shot it against the opposite statue.
The ball flew high above the hole to the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally ran away from Cape Arezabalaga, which jumped towards her and went into the network.
"It was demanding to come into this position, come to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get closer to the naked, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante come and I'm just one touchball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea was headed by 1:0 after the defeat of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker chased the ball back to Matte Kovacic during this game before he turned around in half of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić performed a quick addition to the middle of the field.
Then he led a beautiful passing ball that Hazard brought to the hole.
Hazard wore the defense and hit the ball on his left leg on the network at the opposite statue near the Colman Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Naples in Ligi for the first time at 15 am on Wednesday at the stadium of São Paulo in Naples in Italy.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the UEFA European Union at 15 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased by 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased by 832, a government disaster agency reported early Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho announced at a press conference that a large number of people were arrested in the ruins of the building after a magnitude 7.5 explosion, which was felt on Friday and caused waves of height up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is the rest of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after his wife was killed.
The murder investigation was initiated after the female body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with poor wounds at Grayson Mews in the street of John, and 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from that area to find out if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still under way, but I would like you to contact us all who were near John Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also call on everyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead's apartment and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon on the stage came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police reported that there was a communication procedure for the nearest victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives at Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He stayed speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that they will be able to stay for several hours until they are able to return to their homes.
The police officer reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the crime scene in tears.
It's always saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were located in the building area, and one was parked right outside.
A large number of police officers were standing inside the building area and monitoring the state block.
Of all those who have any information it is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestopers organisation on number 0800 555 111, calling for record 247 of 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the latest memoranda that took place in the middle of the debate on "historic crossing"
His prognosis would be poetic justice for almost the destruction of so many British cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Cricka's attempt "foolishness" and "trying to break history".
John Goldsmit, president of Cromwell’s company, said: “In the debate currently taking place with regard to the removal of copper, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s image before the Westminster Palace became the subject of debate.
The iconoclassam of English civil war isn't something Cromwell did or did.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the proceedings of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful creation of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorney Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century way of thinking and part of the history of people for whom many still consider it worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is considered by many to be more than the end of the 19th century than today, by Parliament's advocate of external pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible view of the subject is a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict between the 17th century and the 17th century has formed the latter development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognition figure that represents one side of this division.
His achievements in the role of the Protector Lord are still worthy of respect and labelling."
The dog killer killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed farmers at a market in the southwestern part of China.
A man for whom only the name "Yuan" was named was found dead frozen arteries and covered blood near the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou published a list of South China's mornings on Sunday.
The pig grower was prepared to take pigs on June 30, 2005 in Xiningu in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big pig man in the apartment with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation has confirmed that the pig weighs 250 pounds [250 kg] of vegetation to death.
The evening news from Guianga says that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bleeding and upset."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan went into the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The manager of the market said for the Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent someone else from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating a death penalty.
Although this rarely happens, human swine attacks have already been reported.
In 2016 he attacked his wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, more than 300 miles [300 km] of pigs had landed a large farmer with a tractor until his wife had driven away an animal.
After the pigs were eaten in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "cooker".
"They're just strangers.
They're Greek, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's wounds bring strong rains to the southwestern United States
As it has been said, hurricane Rosa is weak as it passes through colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring rain rain in the area of North Mexico and the South West of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa was at 05:00 a.m. on the east-east route at a speed of 140 km/h, making her Uragan Category 1, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific creates a low-pressure area and moves towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the deep layer of tropical rain towards the north towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical investment in interaction with the nearby low-pressure area will result in the rise of strong defenses in most of the South-West.
In the local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous volcanic floods, floods and possible cliffs in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical rain will cause the rise of an area of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
A sudden deterioration of conditions may result from the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to leave the sand in the desert because of the dangers of tropical waters.
A heavy rain could turn cannons into divided rivers, and floods with hail will bring local storm winds and sandstorms.
The approach to the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains on the parts of southern California.
It is possible to have an angle of more than 12 mm, which can cause less wet holes and narrow roads.
This will be the first defense in the winter season in this region.
The outbreak of tropical eruptions will be near Arizona on Sunday evening and on Monday morning before the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday in areas where the borders of the United States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah reach their borders and last all day on Wednesday.
In November there are possible major temperature changes across the U.S. as Arctic is cold, but tropical parts will remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature on small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in most of the Central and Eastern United States, the beginning of November will be heated from 27 degrees south to the parts of the north.
New York City could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the large possibility of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of November.
More than 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday on the six television networks busy witness to the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assaults that reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, a political review was continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme for reporting on the change at the last minute of the Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, that the FBI will conduct a single investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that it's absolutely safe that Kavanaugh's drunk condition pushed her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning witness that he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that have transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with measuring the number of people looking at the content of the regulations.
To make this more appealing to you, it's about a publication that's like a number of those who watch American football or Oscar.
Fox News Channel whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of observers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC took another location with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There's been a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of this moderate republicarian issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning how he was summoned by demonstrators while he tried to leave for the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A few minutes stood in line as he was alive in front of CNN's cameras, the demonstrators were busy with the presents.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said, "You have the power while such women are helpless."
Flake said his office announced the announcement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the hearing of the committee.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were alive when the Justices Committee had to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigate complaints against candidates over the next week, which the Democrats in the minority requested.
Flakea partially confirmed conversations with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Fleke's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview for Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his EU exit plan "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a conference of Conservative Parties in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, in another interview with her on the same issue, continued to criticise her Czechers plan for Brexit, saying that it is a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should pay to each other customs duties "completely stupid".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested Dytheon Simpson of a suspected LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for murder with a fire weapon by Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and held in prison under the charge of murder from the station, police administration told Baton Rougea.
Officials published videotape of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyes in the fight.
The police found the crime scene and reported they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, CBS's branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he admitted he shot Wayne and killed him.
It's called for a $350,000 guarantee.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge's office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a scattered wound head through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the escape of the federal police of Louisiana, the federal criminal police laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement bodies for "dependency and truth-finding."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player on the wing of 183 cm grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played the LSU basketball.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps after the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "in shock" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," said Wade.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
Pepeo, which excavates the volcano Popocatapetl, reached the southern parts of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased crater activity and recorded 183 gas and dust emissions within 24 hours.
The center was following multiple harassment and support.
Social media images showed the tanks of ashes on windscreens of cars in Mexico City's neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observe an increased activity of volcanoes, which is 72 kilometers south of the main city since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake in Central Mexico occurred in 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists during the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of independence were fought with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to mark a catalytic polarising vote on vaccination.
A group of masked separatists who were banned by the intervention police began to punch the police with eggs and paints in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The contestants were fired later during the day when the police used their arrows to calm the fighter.
Within a few hours, groups that are talking about independence were scandalized "There is no forget, no forgiveness" and the Unionists called them "The Long Life of Spain".
Forty people were admitted to the hospital because of mild injuries suffered during the demonstration, local pressure was reported.
The tensions in the region that were heavy on independence were not reached even a year after the referendum on 1 November that Madrid declared to be a pro-lawist and which the Catholics were celebrating.
The large majority of voters decided on independence even though the output was small because those who opposed the decommissioning were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting places throughout the region.
Groups fighting for independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in symbol of the support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to move on to another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations together with his wife said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would receive independence.
"We have experienced one of the best moments in the past year.
I watched my parents pay for the happiness they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite their key achievements, despite the close victory of the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties are able to hold back this year because they are the most famous leaders in the self-contained exile or in prison waiting for trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict stirred politicians both sides.
"The situation is all tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been investigating prison since the end of last year, announced that they will be running for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy for European elections is the best way we can recognize the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after killing a car in the house

It's possible at some point on the car there's a gun fired from the car.
The game Menge gave Livingston a win over Rangers with a result 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership League Livingston club surprised Rangerse and forced Steven Gerard to admit his second defeat from the 18th game on the head of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
The fall of Dolly Menge showed up with a decisive decision while the boy Gary Holt in a second dealt with the Iberian.
Gerard's boy still has no win in the guests in Premiership this season, and the next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in a league with eight points left behind.
Before that, Rangers in the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, has increased his ranks of winning at six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's boyfriend had to lead before they got that hit, given that their directness in the attack caused a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but he was on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only drive the ball wide after he pulled off to hit Craig Halkett's head at the goal.
The owners were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for guests
And that's how the key goal has been achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free strike, and Livingston intended to open up, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson accompanied Mengi who hit the middle of the hole.
By that time, Rangers mostly had control of the ball, but they had faced an unskilled domestic defense, so naked Liam Kelly had no business.
It continued in the second half of the year, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the attack.
Allan McGregora's legs were defended by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow led a broad strike from another organised attack on Livingstone.
Long additions failed to cross the lead line Livingstone, and no two single-Esters were awarded – after Halket's match with replace player Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
"Great" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scotland's BBC in Areni Tony Macaroni
The great game and the result of Livingstone.
They were all perfect up to one, and they continued to shift their expectations on that entrance trip.
Their style of games and staff hardly changed from their return to the big clubs, but the great reward goes to Holt and the way he organized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of perfectly organized defenses, and Menga didn't allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a pass.
But Rangers didn't have any inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set up a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't pull the ball to the end. They just opened up a hole in the home boy's house and that's their call to trade for Rangers, who's in the middle of the list.
Erdogan expected with mixed feelings in Coelna
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was very funny under the sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany – whose aim is to improve relations between NATO Unions.
They discussed issues involving human rights, freedom of print and access to the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then went to Coeln to open a huge new mosque.
In that city is the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the mass collection of 25,000 people in front of the station, but a large number of the presidents who came to see it appeared nearby.
And hundreds of demonstrators of Erdogan – from this large number of Kurda – have raised their voices in the condemnation of Erdogan's policy and the German government's decisions to welcome him into the country.
Confronted demonstrations reflect a division that causes a visitor to be praised by some German Turks as heroes, while others are attacked as autocrats.
Road strike in Deptford: Bicyclelist died in a car crash
The biker died in a co-operation with a car in London.
The attack took place near the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, on the road with a rough traffic in Deptford on the south of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and emergency aid arrived, but the man passed by on the face of the spot.
A few months after the death of another biker after the crash and a driver from an accident in the Chiders street, about a mile from a Saturday accident.
City police reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his nearest family.
Unfortunately, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been redirected, and drivers of motor vehicles are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in a riot
Six police officers reported from prison that he was injured in a man's prison in prison.
The disturbances broke out in Long Martin's prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 BST a week and still lasts.
Special "Tornado" efforts have been made to resolve the disturbances involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the face have been given help because of minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “A special training prison staff has been engaged in solving the incident during Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff were helped because of the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly want to know that all responsible will be given police and that we can spend longer time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in November last year, an intervention police was invited to prison to deal with a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard bullets.
Uragan Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with volcanic floods (possible use for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will occur just at the beginning of the next week when hurricane Rosa makes the rest of its way through the desert southwestern and puts the threat of volcanic floods on its way.
National hydrometerological service has already issued warnings about spring floods for Monday and Tuesday in the area of West Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and cross right through it on Tuesday.
A national hydrometallic service in Phoenix, in its tweet, reported that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have caused tropical storms or depression within 200 miles [320 km] of Phoenix!
Uragan Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent model of the National Centre for Uregans is 50 to 100 mm of the range, with an isolated quantity of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon River Arizona.
In other areas of the South-West Forest, including the Wally and the Great Base, there is the probability of a 25 to 50 mm barrier, with an isolated total quantity of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the pink flood, it could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although the floods are a major threat, part of these floods could be useful because the drought government is currently in the southwestern part of the country.
"America's dry area map has been hit by at least extreme drought, another highest category," air.com said.
The Urgan route first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of the maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The forest was found in the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
It is therefore expected that the Gulf of Mexico will be approached by tropical storms on Monday or evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to the rise of floods.
"The number of total catches expected in the area from the Bay California to the north-west Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," air.com said.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or her remnants is very heavy rain on the Baja California peninsula, on the northwestern side of Sonore and on the American Southwest," they reported from the National Centre for Uregans.
It is expected that the rain will cause you to experience life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts and cliffs on the mountain ground.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with fatal wounds in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He's taken to the hospital and stable.
The police administration of Avona and Somerset reported that they were 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds arrested during the night in Radstock.
Police officers have called for all those who have a video of the event.
The trumpet claims that Kavanaugh suffered violence and anger from the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh "has endured evil and anger" the Democratic Party during the nomination procedure.
On Thursday he witnessed before Congress and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault charges more than ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified to a hearing on the charges she filed.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brightness, quality and courage" Kavanaugh on that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's voice is to confirm one of the most successful legal concepts of our time, a judge with an unhindered career in public service," said the authorities gathered in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican exit to the election in half of the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks share us with one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really am," she said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Theump stated that the mission of democracy is to " create opposition and opposition".
The Deputy Leader of the Republican Republican has announced to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian oppression and tsunamis continue to increase
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people lost their lives, from which a large number of them were pulled off the huge waves that hit the coast when a great earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when in the morning they struck up to six metres high on the shore, pulling many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
Kunami followed after the magnitude 7.5 decline.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run and lost immediately," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a conference for journalists in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he drove cars, fats, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that the rabbits crossed open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people jumped onto the stairs to escape from the tsunami and survived," she said.
About 16,700 people are evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, and a dam surrounded by water.
Last night's attacks continued to strike that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in its report stated that the energy released by the massive explosion on Friday was in line with the twenty-first nuclear bomb test launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggests that the geographic location of the city, located at the end of the long and dry riverbed, may have increased the force of tsunami.
He described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugro's words, the number of victims and injuries may be larger than 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Doghrea, which is close to the epicenter of drought.
"Communications are completely interrupted and we don't have information from Donghre."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the report of the Red Cross, which adds to the fact that staff and volunteers have moved into the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," said the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because of the lack of information that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the moment the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top of a building is panickingly warning people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the watery wall fell on the coast, carrying its buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The floods and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity which has caused the interruption of communication around Palu, which has made it difficult for the responsible to coordinate rescue action.
According to the authorities, she started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but it was still essential for evacuations and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until November.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
Kunami in Indonesia took more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"While World Vision staff from Dongree have successfully arrived in the city of Palu where employees are dragged into Tarpaulin Chambers located in their office's courtyard, they have followed the signs of destruction along the way," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief efforts, some have insisted that foreign humanitarians with a great deal of expertise are unable to come to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and commitment of branches from other countries can only begin if the place of accident is declared to be a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the country level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'All right, it's a national disaster' we can receive international aid, but this situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Pala on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that ease the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the canal.
On Saturday the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under siege by her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandon, trainer of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandage, were his students.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel that had spread to a paraglider community, he accidentally sent whatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked by a gray whim instead of two blue whims.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The robbers took $26,750 from US dollars during the banknote filling at the center of Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who filled a banknote at the center of Newport on the Levee, who is in charge of printing Newport's police office.
In a statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver said that the car was empty in the entertainment complex and was prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "came to the race with Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put into the bank.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects running away from the scene of the theft, but the police did not indicate the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper my change in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name in Ye.
In his Twitter release on Saturday, which announced this change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been inspired by Ye for some time and used it as the title of its eight album published in June.
The change comes in the eyes of his guests at the Saturday Night Live show in which he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
Emission authors said that he replaced singer Arian Grande who rejected for "emotional reasons" in the show.
In addition to the short of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," West said earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with the radio director Big Boye.
"So, it's you, it's me, it's us.
It started from Kanye, meaning "one", in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, all in us.
The only album is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but he announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's co-worker, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without drawing and with a label and written with great words.
Mexico's AMLO promised he wouldn't use the army against the citizens
The presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against citizens as the country nears its 50th anniversary of the blood avenges the students.
Lopez Obrador was on the Tlatelolco market on Saturday, he promised that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
War attempts were fired during peaceful demonstrations on that market on 2 November 1968 and even killed 300 people at the moment when left-wing students began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up a large number of free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The United States should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in this area," said an investor in artificial intelligence and an expert in this area of Kai Fu Lee who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment followed after different parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although in principle there is no formal strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
In the meantime, China has presented its plan over the past year: its goal is to become the first country by the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"The double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and that we are looking for the following great discoveries in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"The double increase in investment could double the chances that the next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States," Lee said this week in the CNC discussion.
Lee whose book is: "A great AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by the publisher of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the chief director of the Sinovation Ventures company that invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on the AI system that won the best American player Othello game, and later he was director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google Chinese border.
Lee praised the previous technological competition of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when to hold up the following to find new visionaries.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that's leading academic leaders, it's corporate," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged in the most brightest contracts from universities to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to influence its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should offer green cards automatically," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced an artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to people in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and Other State Organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established the Community Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the activities and academic community, and White House announced the establishment of the Arts Intelligence Committee.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence is no longer uplifting for months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on the change in their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Saturday whether they would like to change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia". This is a step that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been taking place for several decades and which has prevented Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbours' name represents its territory and has invested a veto on the entry of that country into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign to combat vote raised doubts as to whether it would meet at least 50 per cent of the requirements for the referendum to be balanced.
The question on the referendum voter list was: "Are you part of NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The so-called amendments, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that this is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries born after the breakup of Yugoslavia, has allowed access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, enough Members said they would respect it so that I would be considered decisive.
The change in the name requires a bilateral majority in Parliament.
The State electoral authority stated that there were no irregularities reported up to 13 hours.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje, said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined the referendum on 30 September 2018 on the change in the country's name, opening the way for NATO to join the EU and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov before the parliament in Skopje placed a little attention and received chairs in front of the tent that those who were boycotting the referendum put.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top heads, not as servants," Kawadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said the NATO membership will bring so much needed investments to Macedonia, the country in which unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would represent "confirming our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, which is under the necessary responsibility.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the researchers are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious hit by the Western government policy since it took over its mandate in May last year.
Look: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton to get hit
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England tried Brighton's defense and won for Manchester City with result 2 :0.
Aguero has made the defeat a simple, easy hit in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker received an addendum in the middle of the area at the beginning of the attack.
He went through three Brighton's defenses and then got to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponent players in green magic.
He wore one of his armorys and then pushed them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to Sterling's.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the Agure ball which threw the right-hand ball into the right-hand side of the network and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," the journalist reported to the manager of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're glad he got hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial priority in the Premier League.
That hit hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep on Brighton's field during this game.
He added Leroy Sane's ball to the left side.
Sane hit the ball several times before Sterling was introduced to the statistics.
Sky Blue's attacker put the ball into the net net before it hits the car.
Manchester City is fighting against the Hopeneheim in a group game League first on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since Nationals' players were eliminated from playing, there was not much reason to insist on the new start.
But always the contestant Scherserer hopes to win the week against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of West, succeed in playing.
The Rockies win from 5:2 over the Nationals at least secure a place in the wild card playing, but they hope to win their first title.
"Even though we play nothing, we can at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere here is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I'd witness this year.
Why would I not compete in it?"
The Nationals still have to publish a week's starter, but they're reportedly willing to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, got burned in the fireplace on Thursday and will play on Sunday when he's usually resting.
The Washington raincoat in this season has achieved a score of 18 : 7, a range of winning race (ERA) from 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 bilateral changes.
The storm in West Virginia together
During the debate on the importance of the issue of Republican voters at the general election, the President commented on his selection of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court judge.
"All we've done will be at the studio.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – I didn't apply, but I'm actually in the race and so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracy, that is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; see evil, corruption.
They do not care who has to hurt them, who have to pass over the authority and control; they want power and control; We will not give them.
Democrats, it says, have a mission "to resist and stop".
"You've seen it during the last four days," he said, calling democracy "frust, evil, corrupt and lying".
He delivered a democratic Senator Diane Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Senate, which resulted in a loud public rejection.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- it was really a bad word of the body, the worst of the body I've ever seen."
The labist party no longer takes into account different opinions.
Do not tolerate the presentation of personal views
It didn't surprise me too much when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm the last of the representatives of the Laborist Party who were told they weren't welcome – and all because we said what was in our minds.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they took a similar view because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar themes that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with previous leadership.
In a report on the meeting of the Laborist Party Nottingham border on Friday, it was stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I've been working as a local representative of the Laborist Party's main council meeting on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings are being held today in a different tone, and the promise of "more kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become clear that different views are not tolerated in the Laborist Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable foreign leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, since the co-workers I thought we shared a similar political opinion from me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and taking positions that I would never agree with - whether it is about national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and in fact it is not important what I say – it follows the hurtful words on social networks that call for my opposition, which reject the policy of the centre and tell me that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more happiness than some of my colleagues because they're comments that have been directed mainly to me.
I am amazed by the professionality and determination of my colleagues who are facing the wave of sexualist or racist comments every day, but they never exist.
One of the aspects of this political era that has most disappointed me is the tolerance of harmful speech.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said that the labist party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer take different opinions into account and that with each proposal on non-trust or change of electoral rules we become increasingly critical of the party.
Many times in the last two years they advised me to raise my head, not to be so loud and told me that then everything would be all right."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government Margaret Thatcher, who left my school high school student school, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never been hiding my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in the Eastern Nottingham border could have been mistaken about my political positions and areas of non-compliance with current leadership.
All I would like to tell those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment that the country takes Brexit, which will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not want time and energy to lose my loyalty to the leadership of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electoral units, is whether it's about members of the Laborist Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to opposition or political advantage will turn me away from doing what I think is in your best interest.

Air – Melrose: 38 : 17 unimpaired Air going to top
Two late attempts may have had an impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very interesting game of days at the Tennt's Premiership League.
They've now reached the top of the list and the only ones are unbeated by ten teams.
Finally, top defenses and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tried at each game and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose's club said: "Every honor to Ayru, they have taken advantage of opportunities better than us."
Try Grant Anderson in the 14 minutes that Frazier Climo realized brought Air into the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who turned Warriors off from the game, enabled Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealistic attempt.
The climate has increased Ayra's leadership to one-offs before, in half-time, he got hit and realized his own attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 o'clock.
But Melrose, in the second half, started well and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced priority to five points.
At that time, she had a long stand due to the serious injuries of Ruaridha Knotta that they carried on the carriages, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play well by trying Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose remakes an additional player to pay, and that's an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for the destruction of climate that didn't have a ball; from the line for the punishment strike, MacPherson carried out a position behind Ayra in full lockdown.
Climo realized how he did it almost again after Kyle Rowe received a high hit from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in five attempts at home boy.
The Still Game series star looks ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to continue working in the official activities after it has been discovered that it is named by the director of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvisis in the favorite BBC series whose scenario is one of the stars, along with a long-term partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nine seasons would be the last one to show, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglinga.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Aposomorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan wanted to join "increasing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will grant her an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the marine center full of diesel in La Paz.
In public buildings, the ocean color flag has been reported.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon or crickets say: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost sea in Chile during the face of the 19th century resource struggle is still alive – just as is the scarcity for the again ships of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice judgment expected on 1 November, following a five-year procedure, hope may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians across the country will look to the International Court of Justice for large screens and hope that the judge in Haagu will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after more than a decade of demanding negotiations, will be obliged to negotiate the rise of the sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic auto-ethnic president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the trial on Monday.
"We are returning the Pacific again," he promised at the end of the colonization.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge for Bolivia and that it would change little if it were.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and it stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice judgment comes six months after the final hearings means that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, the last four years may have been behind them.
"The question of access to the sea has now been accepted by Bolivian leadership," Zarate said.
Morales' combat rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at one time, but then it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not changed the delegates since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivian representative in Haagu, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relation to Chile" and "an end to 139 years of non-compliance with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the sea issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never deny access to the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we have to cross through the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if it couldn't trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclear-disarmed unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to keep promises of days during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
Comments were made at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, coming more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "freedom of imagination" and that the US's opposition to a declaration on the end of the Korean War will never leave the North on its knees.
Washington is not a tool to support a statement without Pjongjang taking concrete steps first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another meeting at the top.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to withdraw the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans next month to visit Pyongyang to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris’s fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big covers for head on the way to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to advance your collection of hats or completely block the sun, don't keep looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne in fashion introduced a line of broken grooves for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and excited lovers of style in the Paris weekly fashion.
This extremely inflexible hats have helped Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the track.
The example he came up with was Valentino, and it is about a large, wide-spread area that is like a spring that he has completely "undertook" the head of the model.
The other smooth additions included the skulls wrapped in a net, magic hat, and even pineapples, but those additions aren't meant to warm your head.
Thom Browne also introduced a collection of magic masks – just in time for the Night of the Witch.
Many of the charming masks had their mouth-fixed lips and made Hannibal Lecter more than the pieces of high fashion.
One creature designed a roning suit with dyslica and mask, and the other looked like a cornet with frozen ice cream.
If you follow a big fashion statement, happiness is on your side.
Stylers predict that huge hats could come into luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats are perfectly attached to the La Bomba subtitling, a broken hat with an area of about 60 cm wide, which is seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult symbol that stands behind an extremely inflexible hat that pushed the social network into fashion was another great creation — a piece of sandbag almost as big as a manicin in the shopping costume she wore.
In the 2019 Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection was an example of a huge orange bag, decorated with raffia resins and white leather gloves.
A well-known and famous stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect great beach hats and bags in luxury shops for the next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion supplements."
John Edward: Language skills that the citizens of the world need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic performance, which has continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results, giving them a unique and common success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools for the goal are to prepare students for further education and higher education, which they want to do to citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement this school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be preferred and desired object of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela stated: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, that goes into his head.
If you talk to him in his mother tongue, it's going to be his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the most evaluated in languages have reached out to independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who learned foreign languages received excellent evaluations.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment for the Mandarin language, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as election items are considered as important as STEM objects (knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to lack of labour force with language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for careers.
Since more jobs require language knowledge, skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, those who have learned to speak foreign languages in the future will feel the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks more than one language can directly communicate with foreigners, which gives her the advantage in relation to competition.
According to a survey by the organisation YouGov in 2013, involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language well enough to communicate with it, and French is the only language that speaks the bilingual percentage of researchers, 15% more precisely.
So investing in learning the language is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
Every school in Scotland offers different languages.
Some schools will set up classic, modern languages in their programme, while others will decide for languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools there will always be a variety of choices, as well as a teacher’s staff who is skilled in this area.
Scotlandn independent schools allow children to learn to prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future holds for us.
It cannot be ignored that in today’s global business, knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country so that it must be reflected in education.
So the knowledge of modern languages should certainly be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of languages, diversity and excellence to young Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron will play for the first time in Lakers' dress on Sunday in San Diego.
Navigators will soon be waiting for LeBron James' first launch for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-sessional game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton to Lakers' official.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell posted a tweet saying James is probably not gonna play the whole game.
After training this week, James answered questions about his plans for the presidential zone in Lakers, which consists of six games.
"In this phase of career I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump maintains a joint in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign with numerous groups tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned groups that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
The Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for future elections because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose most of the Congress after the student vote.
How many hours does the West Virginia Tourup gathering start and how can you look at it online?
The trumpet in Wheeling in West Virginia is banned for 19 hours after the Eastern Time, tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Drumpo's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live streams on YouTube.
The trumpet will probably comment on this week's hearing of the candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh who have raised complaints of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmed decision to wait is already a week before the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the primary objective of this series of groups is to help the Republicans achieve the priority for the elections in the student.
Therefore, from Trump's presidential campaign guardians report that five groups banned for the next week have "stimulating volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Most of the Congress is so important to the presidents' plans that they will travel to as many countries as we enter the brown campaign," the Reuters anonymous spokesman for the Trump campaign said.
A tonight's summit to be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The trumpet will visit West Virginia a second time in the past month. In 2016 he won over 40 percent points.
The trumpet is trying to help the presidential candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that his president needs to help him improve his grade in the polls," Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The U.S. team left the heart on the ground before the single rounds on Sunday
After three single sessions, breaking up the pairs on Sunday afternoons may be exactly what was supposed to turn Ryder Cup.
"Course is about happiness" is a statement that is particularly valuable in sports and which sports believe, especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the lucky round now?
"There were six points of advantage, and now there are four. So I think happiness is now on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while there are still 12 points to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their back and encouraged his game in a couple with Justin Thomas, with which he won three out of four points after a whole day's game.
Spieth played murder from tea to green and can serve as an example for others.
The Navigating Celebrations became more and more vocal when Spieth and Thomas arrived at two points left, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth came to an unsolved outcome.
After the path he won the game with 15 holes, he followed a similar racing race in which hope can be recognized and he believes that Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
The team's just left it for players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spietha and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's sensation.
A European weird, but indisputable couple has a maximum number of points and can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't lose the score on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back Nina on Friday morning.
This winning line, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that they are exactly the players that should win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than two of them who can guarantee the European win as the sun goes down on the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly arranged Alex Noren and Sergey Garcija for a great performance in the morning game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes at the playground buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they failed to dig.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals get out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch pairs games near because you can see the interaction between players in pairs, hear the advice they give and those who don't give, and study the strategy that can change at the moment.
Europeans have already played better as a team, and on the last day they come in with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fight, in which some, especially the states, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day Ryder Cup enters with 10 :6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the US from 10:6 .
The dynamic Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods brought with four points of difference to Le Golf National.
European boy Thomas Bjorna trying to win the trophie he invented in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than an American boy in the morning game in couples than the results of 3:1 .
The American boy showed a bigger fight in the pairs of winning two games, but the difference in the points was already great.
To win the trophy of boy Jim Furyk, eight points must be collected in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debater from the European boy who won four points at the same time, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after the sensory weekend, only another couple who won four points in the game in the couples in the history of Ryder Cup.
After they defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they proved to be powerful in the game against Woods and American debater Bryson Dechambeau won from 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games did some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 hits of 29 games in fourballs and seven hits in the yard.
Justin Rose pauses in the morning for fourballs to come back with his partner Henrik Stanson to play with the pairs and experience a victory from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third greatest player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't go as much as they did during a pleasant day in the southeastern part of Paris.
Tropical winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points a week and thus put a list high on their American boy.
First they defeated Spanish Jona Rahma and Iana Poultera as a result of 2&1 in the Fourballs, and then they beat Poulter and Rory McCllroy with 4&3 in the pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in the entire history of Ryder Cup boy who was in the rest of the four points she managed to get back in a single game, although Fury's boy needs only an unsolved result to keep the trophies.
After two days in the rest of the world, it seems they're going to have a hard week's battle.
North Korea announced that "no chance" for unilateral disarmament without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday before the United Nations that further sanctions would increase mistrust in the United States and that North Korea would not be able to unify itself and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea has given "significant measures of good will" last year," for example, stopped nuclear and rocket tests, dismantled a nuclear test station and decided to stop nuclear technology and weapons development.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't believe in the United States, we don't believe in our national security, and under such circumstances there's no way we're going to get shot first."
Although Ri has reiterated the well-known claims of North Korea on Washington's resistance to "progressive" denuclearization which would progressively eliminate the sanctions in North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US President and North Korea's leaders in Singapore on 12 July, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States pledged that Pjongang would withdraw nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization is carried out before this and increases pressure by means of sanctions in order to enforce its objective strongly, and even counter "declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can cast us on our knees is just a misunderstanding of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that continued sanctions increase mistrust."
Ri has not mentioned whether there are plans for the second meeting of Kima and Trump that the President of the United States spoke at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out how Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If South Korea had sought denuclearization, and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this stage."
In spite of all, the tone of speech by Minister Rija has largely differed from last year's when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that the target of continental US rockets was inevitable after bad President Trump called Kim "man rocket" on the suicide mission.
The storm that threatened North Korea's "complete destruction" last year praised Kim in the United Nations for his courage to do so, but added that he was waiting for more work and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
Theump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: "It doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until full, final and checked denuclearization is reached."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Rij at the UN headquarters and then said he would visit Pyongjang again next month for preparations for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been well.
He left Pjongjang in Serbia and said he had made progress, but North Korea has spent it a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed with Moon this month to detonate the rocket sites and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States undertakes "relevant measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "relevant measures" relate to the security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and to certain steps towards stabilization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard go to a course that teaches them how to relax well
A new course at Harvard University enabled all students to sleep well in an effort to fight the increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academic noted that students at the world’s best universities often have no idea of the principles of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course he considers to be the first such in the United States.
He came to the idea of a course after he kept talking about the effect of deprepitation on learning.
At the end of the class, one girl came to me and said: “Why did I just find this out now, in the last year of college? ”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course that is held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services, Paul Barreira, says the University has decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep has been observed in students during the week.
The single course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes the picture of student bedrooms where students need to click on cups of coffee, cups, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how low sleep affects success and how important sleep routine is.
During the study, students also learn how long - term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus with interactive icons that motivates students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on lifelong learning before the study continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that there is a lack of sleep in the bigger problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and fatigue should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping also helps to fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into the state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler figure out a course after his first year in Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course throughout the camp.
As the next step, he plans to request all postgraduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm for sleep time, as well as for waking hours. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit the powered electronic devices, as well as the LED light that can disrupt the circular rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Winning naked porassion Gerard's boys
The Rangers endured another defeat after the defeat of Dolly Menge defeated poor defense of Steven Gerard and ended the game by winning Livingstone with the result 1 :0.
The boy from Ibrox wanted to win the first win in the guest post-triumph in the matches and results 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but the boy Gary Holta caused Gerard's second win in the 18th game, so his boy now remains eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the event seven minutes ago, and Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and didn't seem to have the same results.
While the Rangers are now on the sixth floor, Livingston jumped on the third floor with just one story of a difference behind the Hibernia.
It could come up with new problems for Rangers after a line judge called Callum Spence got a headache when something was thrown away from the distance.
Gerard made eight changes on his sides and thus moved near Ayra to the semi-final Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same set of Livingstone that Hearts took a measure last week and would be pleased to see how his well-intended attitude has undermined every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more ball in possession, but Livingston got more with her.
They had an opportunity for the event two minutes ago after Menga was thrown out of the game for the first time that Scott Pittman opened space to go to the naked Allan McGregor, however, the prisoner missed this opportunity.
A deep free strike by Keaghan Jacobss was interrupted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense attorney Alan Lithgow could only track down an inaccurate attack on the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one time, but at the end of the third game they seemed to play with hope instead of confidence.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that the judge should have tried him a 1st in 15 minutes after his co-operation with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian request.
The Rangers in the first half of the year managed to lead only two balls towards the naked, but the former Ibrox doorr Liam Kelly one hit on Lassane Coulibaly's head and the hit by Ovie Eyarie didn't pose a big problem.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute play has slowed down the game, no one can cut their effort.
The Rangers have again failed to use Jacob's deep-fashioned ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his privacy and picked Meng for a simple end of the attack.
Gerard responded during the stand and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement had almost had a current effect because the hideous player added Morelos's ball, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett made a long hit for each other.
Holt's side could have provided leadership at the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a broad flight from the corner.
The Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for one more time because he slept with Jacobs, but Thomson and this time he turned around.
Almanah: Immigrant of Geiger's Count
And now we're following a page from our Almanah on Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and later developed a device known as Geiger's calculator.
Since then, Geiger's numerator has also become the main sponsor of culture pop, for example in the 1950 movie Bells of Colorado, where most of the most incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played:
Man: "What is that, god?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s calculator, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these listeners, you can actually hear atoms that react to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans said, "Look at this, you hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad stations
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to "see" bad stations and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the bad station as part of the treatment
The procedure includes the removal of the immune system from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
The cells are treated to "recognize" white cells that are common to many types of cancer and then re-inject into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer was withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of the immune system from the patient, their change in the laboratory in order to "recognise" white protein under the name HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and re-initiation of the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 leads to growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat throat cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting the immune system from patients and their “learning” to identify cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after attending the Saturday Night Live show, joined in the discussion on Trump and supported it, wearing a hat with the title "Let's make America big again".
It's not a good time.
Kanye West was interviewed during the Saturday Night Live show after a break in which US President Donald Trump was praised and announced that he would apply for the 2020 president.
After he performed the third night song called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the title "Let America Be Great Again", he continued talking against democracy and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me how you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I'm worried about cutting myself off, I'd be leaving America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show started with a satirical scene where Matt Damon ridiculed Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the US Senate's Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't issued, the West speech video on the social network was taken by Commissioner Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to order West.
Also, West complained to the public that behind his attentions were handed over because of the hat he wore.
"They got mad at me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They tortured me!
They said I was done," said the Washington Examiner.
The West went on, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and he said he'd take off his Superman's plate because it means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments caused at least twice the public disillusionment, and the members of the Saturday Night Live show met with shame, while one newspaper columnist said: "The whole study was silent."
West has been invited at the last moment as a replacement for singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, reper Mac Miller passed a few days earlier.
West is the execution of the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, inspired by many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who announced on Twitter: "One of the most brave people: Thank you for the fact that you're just leaving MAFIJI."
But the director of Karen Hunter's Twitter show said that the West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or by supporting his "art") whom I believe to accept and spread the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now "be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, which is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Didy.
His colleague, Reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, the music legend Prince changed its name in symbol, and then into an artist known as Prince.

The prosecution will consider the prosecution.
The Star of the Series Game of the Kit Harrington has become a toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow, who hires a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of adventure.
But the 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that because of such television roles, children often feel they have to be firm to gain respect.
In a discussion on The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxicity in #MeToo Erie.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the game series, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I feel very determined on my own at this moment – where have we been wrong with marriage?" he asked.
"What have we learned from these men as they grew up in relation to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male figures on screens, could be partly responsible for the growth of toxicity.
He continued: “What was born, and what was learned?
What does it teach on TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they have to have these certain drawings of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
For obviously something went wrong for the boys."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not record the series of the game series after its end of the following summer and said he "has finished with the wars and horses".
From the studio, Kit will play in the new performance of the true West exhibition by Sam Shepard, about a film producer and his brother stealing.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that getting to know Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the recording of the game.
"I met my wife by filming that series, which gave me my family so much and the future," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won Emmy's prize playing Ygritte's role, the love of Kitto's cousin Jon Snow.
A couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new cases of infection of 14 %
China reported an increase of 14% in the population living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second trimester of 2018.
Most of the new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which has been changed in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted to parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, the health authorities of China said that the person who is infected with HIV in this way is almost dead.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decried in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is great.
Research estimates that 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women due to conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships are due to inappropriate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to deal with this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public has accessed data on GOP senators, calling it "hazardous lies" and "confirming theories"
The US representative of Maxine Walters rejected the statement on Saturday that a member of her staff published personal data from three U.S. republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles confirms that he claims to extend this to individuals "extra right wing" as well as web sites.
"Ladies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual harassment by the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators were sent to Kavanaugh's hospital.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of these data belongs to the Waters Office, as well as information about the staff member's representative, reported The Hill.
"These unsubstantiated instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
‘A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and uninstinct statements – is not at all responsible for hiding these data.
These unsubstantiated instructions are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House speaker Aria Fleisher.
"This is a mad denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that Waters has no temperature to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he hasn't done should not be angry.
He shouldn't be ashamed.
He must not question the reasons of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
It was found that Fleisher compares Barbara Walters' reaction to criticisms that Democrats lead to Judge Kavanaugh, who were accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competed against Waters in general elections, also announced on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Watersova stated that her office informed "the international bodies and bodies of order" about these false claims.
"We will make sure that manufacturers are discovered and that they have legal consequences for all work that is harmful and dangerous to my entire office," she continued.
A review of the film "Johnny English: Retirement" – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson to fight the spy
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that in the new screen of the Johnny English action series whose first "Johnny English" was shown for the first time in 2003 and returned to the big screen with the title "Johnny English" in 2011.
Will our own satirical satiricals be able to see how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English with educated eyes and rubber faces again has permission to complicated the situation, while his name says more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims at the "distributed" glamour of memory on Inspector Clouseau, has the character of Mr. Beana and thus recalls that guy who wrote a note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
His image is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man who once played Atkinson now forgot TV advertisements for Barclaycard and who's picking up a case.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest movie release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a middle-aged trap and when the propeller suddenly hit his helmet.
It is visible of Atkinson's talent for the physical comedy, but humor is considered to be quite uninteresting and unusual, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "impossible missions" and themselves offer comedy elements.
Humor is considered to be intended children, not adults, and I think Johnny English's events are not so innovative and focused as those of Atkinson's gegos are not taken into account in Mr. Bean's face.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble is now a generalized fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy web and discovered the identity of all British agents, at the horror of an agent's duty, who, unfortunately, briefly appeared in Kevin Eldon.
It's too much of a prime minister's patience, a superior and warlord's guy who's experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically forced: Emma Thompson is trying to be loyal to the person who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something with.
The intelligence consultants discover to her that all active spies are compromised and therefore will have to rehabilitate the deceased agent.
And this person will be an unattended Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as a director of some disqualification school, but the poet teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several comfortable gegos here because English teaches rock style spying.
English quickly brings into the government room at an emergency meeting, where it will meet again with Bough, its former partner and its eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an enthusiastic submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly spent.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing all the wrong are returning to action and seeing a beautiful dead woman named Ophelia Bullett, who was executed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is at risk under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volte who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous events: destroyed in the canobar of the abandoned French restaurant, the challenge of a huge mess unfolding on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English challenges the full anarchy trying to use audiences for virtual reality to find out how the interior of Voltina's house looks.
Everything was done as needed for this last move, but as much film was attractive and confusing, it still contains hundreds of children's elements.
It's a pretty medium-term achievement.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I once again wondered if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The labist party refuses to draft a plan for the British to work four days a week and will be paid in five days
The labist partner Jeremy Corbina will consider a radical plan for which the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the chief companies to track down the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day of freedom.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
The source suggests that the idea could be "incorporated" into a foreign economic programme and plans to attract the country to the interests of workers.
The syndicated convention supports the transfer of four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Laborist Party said for The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved by night, but represents a weighting that fits into the approach this party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The labist party would not be the first to provide its support for such an idea, since Green party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the labist party does not accept this burden as a whole.
A spokesman for the Laborist Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The shadow officer, John McDonnell, used the previous conference of the Laborist Party to develop its vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to overcome the power of "free executives" and "profess" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water business companies may not be able to return their full role because the Labour Government could make "response" on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the management board of companies and to create inclusive own funds so that 10 percent of private companies' capital would be paid to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh gave a final vote on his application for a Supreme Court for at least one week and asked whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was issued on Sunday, journalist "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there is a possibility that the FBI will find something that would suggest changing their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said go to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after your instructions were issued, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, irreverent, unintended."
Graham's voice, however, like he's stuck in the rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should be strongly accused of changing it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has definitely lost everything," Graham added, thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the person she named could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since that.
I can't see anything has changed."
What's Global Citizen Festival, and has anything been achieved about reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be home to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star description and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
Seven years ago, Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is the beginning of 2012, is the project Global Poverty Project, an international negotiating group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get an event free ticket (except if they were not willing to pay the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen actually been taking into account that he's been reaching his goal for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of awarding people to a free concert the right way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case called "clivism" – where people feel that signing online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that it has marked more than 19 million "actions" of its ports, which have been difficult to achieve a range of objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in an amount of 37 billion dollars that will affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had introduced 390 commitments and notifications that have been made from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the security resources have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executives in the United Kingdom that seeks to "help children develop their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda to end its population in this area.
"With the help of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can find that social injustice becomes just a fuse in history," said Tracey Ullman, editor of the "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project that will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most common questions on your website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult time ► we will sometimes experience failure.
But we'll succeed, as well as great civil rights and anti-apartite movements before us, because we're stronger together.
The events of Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the events of this year's event in New York that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports from being used by the Minister of Interior
Washington can, "if necessary," use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner points out weekly.
Zinke stated that the Russian undertaking in Syria is particularly where it acts on a legitimate government call for an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that it is the reason Russia in the Middle East that wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But, according to him, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States with the help of seafarers can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blocks, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event whose home was the non-profit consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out how they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less use and fuel exchange," he said, and for Russia it says "services the same trick" in the fossil fuels-dependent economies.
At the same time, statements were made by the Trup administration to increase its exports of natural gas into Europe, thus replacing Russia with a far-off option for European consumers.
In this sense, the officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "uncompliant" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to the Trump, has made Berlin "safflicted" Moscow.
Moscow has in several ways stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition to Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. station caused a German reaction that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leader of the German Industry Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States to comply with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when third countries are involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" the possibility of running for the 2020 president, says the UN Senator Massachusetts
The Senate of the Federal State of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it would "really consider" a candidate for the president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Hollyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking she was also a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, and that's what we understand a woman on her head," she said.
"After Friday 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the President."
Warren delivered an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying that "this country is headed in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren was publicly critical of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should be candidateised in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Research Centre, fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidateised.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey has shown greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38% vote for potential candidate and 48% against.
The rest of the names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for the 2020 president were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Buden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Fire at Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after he reported in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of family violence that occurred on Monday night
"What passes through my son, what passes after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the effects of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers return with," said the audience of Donald Trump in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that was being watched and for his son and other war veterans said that "they return a little different, they go back to their defenses, they come back asking if there are any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, gave for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasili, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women, harassment of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police administration of the city of Vasille.
18 United States and D.C. support new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Colombian District support the legal challenges of a new US policy that cuts down asylum on victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is anti-political, reports NBC News.
A lot of names of prosecutors in Grace's case against Sessions, which the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties has not been discovered in the fight against federal policy.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" violated, but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing current problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 by which immigrants who do not have documents and who are fleeing violence in the family are allowed to apply for asylum.
The state attorney in Colombia, Karl Racine, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law finds that all asylum claims are resolved on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a prohibition violates the principle," says a friend of the court's report.
Lawyers further stated that a policy that reduces the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, claiming it is more likely that it will become entrepreneurs and "insurance the necessary labour force".
The chief state attorney Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from family violence and gang violence in June.
"Asil is available to those who leave their home because of persecution or fear because of race, faith, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on policy on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all problems even all serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Disaster relief efforts in Palu while the number of victims doubled in the search for survivors
The situation was all too difficult for survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while breastfeeding her boyfriend who was in the danger zone at the evacuation centre in Palu.
"The emergency aid vehicle shall be imported every minute.
The government condemns clean water."
The inhabitants are seen coming back to their destroyed homes, wandering through the flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by 7.5 degrees, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Dwia Harisa, who suffered from back and shoulders swelling, were in front of the War Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated on open ground because of continued severe subsequent seizures.
His tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of violent harassment that brings the hotel room to the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," Haris said to Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then she followed the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of " maltreatment" by "propagandistic advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspapers published four long advertising pages in an American diary that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China's trade, an American ambassador in China accused Beijing of abusing American press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump returned on Wednesday to the paid addendum of China Daily in the most marketed newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after he accused China of wanting to join the US Congress elections on November 6, which China rejects.
The trumpet claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the US elections noted what US officials in the Reuters statement characterised as a new phase of Washington's scaling campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently closed in the skilful trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
The Chinese withdrawals at the beginning of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in such countries as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts' allegations.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime Governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had been harmed by American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published on Sunday in the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by promoting advertising in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and press by making a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited votes against and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have on the disturbing Chinese economic journey because they are media under the strong pressure of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most impressive Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspapers were about.
Kavanaugh's debasing republicans have removed voters before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Since many Republicans are present with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh and defend him by several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn of the negative reaction that will result during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were so alarmed that most Republicans had already shown that they still wanted to vote.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, said for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the latest intensification of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) to conduct an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday ► will not forget it either tomorrow nor in the summer," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and a national voter of the progressive movementOn group, reported in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors sang: "Come cold!" in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who control the Legal Committee were ready to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Enthusiastism and motivation for democracy will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already on high ground, which is the truth.
But they could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to elections."
Even before the Ford's public testimony in which its allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge are detailed, analysts suggest that negative reactions could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real meeting for an old party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the record club, but also about how the Republicans joined it and how they dealt with it," quoted Guy Cecil, director of the USA's Organization of Priorities, a group that helps in the election of democracy.
However, it seems that the Americans are deeply divided about what they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more of their interest in it.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the researchers are definitely or are likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Fordov.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Debor Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
The forum witnessed before the Senate's Legal Committee during the last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk condition when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her genitals at the party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Designer is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's Open Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee found out how the intention behind the Inrupt “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said thinking about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "private network storage" or POD.
It can include contact descriptions, commitment descriptions, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same page at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal data online storage is that the decision about who can access information to the user's full content.
The company calls it "the personal strengthening of data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's Chief Executive Director, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help solid become available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Leea, Brucea, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project contract for work, as well as community volunteers.
Starting this week, developing engineers around the world have been able to make their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether he will or not bring about a complete change in which all their business models would turn over the night completely.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web concert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Last month Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even while inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next generation of networks," adds Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrations of the Revolt of the First World War Victoria Crisis · Global Voices
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was represented by the Victorian crisis as a resident of World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Major Bernard Vann won a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a rapist and never found out that he had received the greatest honor of the British war.
The monument-stones discovered two of his grandsons in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" what the stone would find just 100 years after his grandfather was buried for whom he had received this recognition.
According to a report from the official list of London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentina's Canal "through a very thick fog and under a strong fire which came from the direction of the war field and the machine".
Later, he stepped into the first row and with "unbelievably brave" led the search forward, but without any help, he jumped on a field top and pulled three out of the military station.
Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on 4 November 1918. ► Something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, and what motivates humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a vineyard after the parade, led by the Parade Orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown through support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed combat skills stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Praschic Peppu
Imagine this stay awake all night to watch a set of Bellator 206 swords so that you will eventually be unable to follow the main event.
The San Josea program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Great Britain they were shown alive at night on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a fight between them, observers in Great Britain were shocked when the transfer was interrupted by Praščić Peppa.
Many weren't quite impressed after they were just awake from the battle until early in the morning.
A lover of child pornography on Twitter described it as “a kind of sick joke”.
"In accordance with the state regulation, this content is not suitable for issue at 6 a.m. and they had to be transferred to the child programme," says Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communications vice president of Bellator, when they asked him about transfer.
"Jupi, "Prasčić Peppa."
Company President Bellator, Scott Cooker, said he would harmonize his schedules to include future observers from Great Britain.
"When I think about reprising, I think we can probably fix something," said Cooker.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to realize anything until it comes to us on Sundays, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the transfer was canceled, they crossed many of the prescriptions that were not friends.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you the next time it doesn't come.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six.
There are unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sex
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality but that gave him reason to succeed.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school he wasn’t aware that “they weren’t all like me. ”
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others "a hope".
He also said his victory at the Olympic Games was less important than his father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has been resting for several months because of the disease.
Speaking as a loser at the first Laverne show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "lower" compared to others because "there was no socially acceptable love for both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, your feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to the other things have been the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed."
He says he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became an outstanding figure for LGBT people and used his influence on this year's Commonwealth Game in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he believed that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The world's first trotsky said he was surprised by what he fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013.
Daley married an employer, who was 20 years older than he was, but he said that he had never had a problem with his differences in years.
"When you're so young," he turned to his first Olympic game when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later from cancer, he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age and to experience similar successes and failures.
In June they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "wide perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept it to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in first order.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in first order'," he said.
"I held him in my hand while he was up, and just when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he wasn't victorious," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the prize.
"I knew only that it was what I had dreamed of all my life to jump before the local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song "Proud" by the singer Heather Small who dressed in it during preparation for the Olympic Games and which is always on .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio for 4 weeks at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson outside the club on Ryder's word on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to return completely to his form to avoid an unpleasant transition.
Mickelson, who sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club on Saturday with four ball games and four-quarters in this two-year competition.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as was often for the United States, a peterstrike winner spent a day in swimming and playing his game at the gym hoping to correct what he is suffering.
Never the most precise player, not even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the required Le Golf National field, where long uneven ground routine penalty strikes.
And if I'm not afraid enough, Mickelson is faced with the exact first British Open Francescom Molinary on Sunday, which has won with the new Tommy Fleetwood in all four matches this week.
If the Americans, which start 12 individual games with four points less, arrive at the hot start, the Mickelson game could be absolutely key.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man more than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, grabbed me by my back, grabbed me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence."
He's been famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't mean to play two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falla on Sunday for the number of Ryder matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's pocket that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 beats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence has brought some material values into it.
"He's funny, sardistic, spiritual, he likes to laugh with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think young players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the head of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Danac Debt Debt in Valderrama in 1997, where Captain Seve Ballesteros's team had the advantage of five points in relation to the Americans, but the game was ended by their victory with a close difference from 1411⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2.
"You will always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a close difference," Bjorn said, in a picture, after watching the 2018 boy who won the 5th 1⁄2 3th of Friday and yesterday led the 10th of 6th of Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play with full power.
Get out of the field and do whatever you want.
Nothing's finished until it's announced to be placed on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and it's still focused on it.
I'm always talking, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we're so aware of who stands against us as the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players in the heavy golf field, Bjorn added: “In this I would never run in front of the mine.
Tomorrow it's time to face another animal.
Tomorrow's the main single event, and that's something else.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as a single person, finally your ability to play golf is tested.
It's the message you have to take to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your roommate because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorna, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the players, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk was also at the end of these great events of the last few days, since he was part of the victory boy in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," Ben Crenshaw answered in response to the question of how he encouraged his players before the last day.
"To-morrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve great results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that plane moves in a certain direction, he puts great pressure on the middle arrow.
In accordance with this we organized our establishment and set up the boys as if we were going to, you know, try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justina Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going through this cycle because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship restored to its waiting position
The latest German warship flag should be released in the spring of 2014, in order to replace the old warships from the cold war era, but will not be ready for at least the following year because of unfair systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship of the whole new flag class Baden-Wuertemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit’s list of military speakers.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but concern about the problems after the shipment hit the end of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg ships, which was ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Fregat class Bremen.
As well as known, there will be a strong top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-tubbrad rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods ► it should be possible to arrange for the newest frigates during a period of up to two years without returning to the maternity ward.
However, the constant delay means that the most modern warships, which is said to enable Germany to demonstrate its power abroad until the moment of entry into service, will already become obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 F125 accident hit all the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the mariner brought the ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if sent to the combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Wuertemberg ships will manage crews of about 120 nautical miles below the old Bremen class flags.
Also, it has been shown that the ship is a dramatic burden that reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the sea to add future upgrades.
It is believed that ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ of 7000 tonnes is twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to unfair hardware, the price of the whole project including crew training also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest fleets become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German maritime forces are being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Parliament Committee, acknowledged that mariners are actually "inventing ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem was growing in time, because the old ships were put out of line and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of Baden-Württemberg's fraternal class could join the sailors.
The National Foundation Hears the Secret Life of Smiles
New research carried out on property in Scotland is aimed at discovering how deaf people use land in food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these single air carriers and help in conducting future conservation activities.
The studies carried out by scientists at the National Reserve for Scotland (NTS) will follow the usual and powerful pathulous smiles, as well as the smell of long and riveric smiles in the Inverwe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the smoothness activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using manual detectors.
The technical analysis of the sound of all the images will determine the frequency of voice voting and what type of action it does.
Then there will be a map of the station and reports to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor of the NTS, hopes to discover which areas are the most important for the species and how they are used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on the management of stations, such as the creation of habitats and how best to maintain forest surfaces for droughts and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of shishmis has decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and work on an arrangement that affects shelters and damages.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as molluscs and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and attacks by cat lovers.
The smiles aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching rain.
They use sophisticated eulogy technique to find the bubbles and obstacles on their flight.
NTSC, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes save.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for spices in Scotland on the property of Treve in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten species of spices in Scotland.
Director David Thompson says ownership is an ideal area for them.
"There's a huge room for smiles here in Thrave," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old buildings and all the good buildings.
However, there is still much we don't know about smiles, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us better understand what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of noise before the start of work to maintain within the building, since the sudden destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
The smiles are protected and illegally killed, tortured or disturbed or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Anti-Smoking Company, urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our voices, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their population progresses."
Ronaldo rejects claims of rape while lawyers prepare to accuse the German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo was accused of rape that he described as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will charge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing Americans by the name of Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid 375 000 dollars to protect her from the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video of the life that he put on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after reporting the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-star winner of the Golden Balls in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the football player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for what they called "an unacceptable report on questions in the field of privacy," writes Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that you will seek compensation for "the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of infringements, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
It is reported how the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting in the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reported that they returned to the football room where they reportedly raped her anal, they are listed in the documents submitted in the Clark District District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was "good guy" who failed that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was reasonable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed by injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an outside deal because she "feared the ransom" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-four-year-olds say she wants to cancel the contract now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this was transferred to the Italian Love Juve in the course of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will "always fall" for lost car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if after Brexita loses the status of the world leader in car production, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added how "anxious" is what Toyota UK told BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on borders in Brexit's case without an agreement could result in loss of jobs.
Pogon Burnaston, produced by Toyota Auris and Aventis, has produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my position that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of the wedding without agreement, experience the sustainable production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyotin in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement for possible effects on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Minia factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer is the risk of the supply chain in Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyotin's production line works according to the "on time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for vehicles operating on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it could lead to a interruption at the border for which industry says it could lead to delays and lack of shares.
Toyota in his factory in Derbyshire could not keep more goods than those needed for one day, they said from that company and production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Checkers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU "was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must agree. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will, as I say, enable us not only to maintain today's success but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence not only Toyote but also other producers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term attention would be paid, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the Union’s union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience, after you're gone, never come back. ”
The government spokesman says: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trompo's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with deputy state attorney Rod Rosenstein could "betting for another week" as the fight continues against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh, a White House was announced.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between the troops and Russia and any interference with the justice of the president.
The question is whether Trump will release the replacement of a state attorney and thus threaten Mueller's independence, which has been spreading the trails in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he'd just take a leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
The trumpet said "I wouldn't like" to forgive Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, which also resulted in a lot of Senate vote.
The press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
Well, we'll see, and I always like to notify you about everything."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders did not hold a press conference in the White House since 10th of September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of a press conference was not due to the "theatric behaviour" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not resist the facts to interfere."
Then she announced that direct contact between the trumpet and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she added, adding without indicating the evidence: "We have analyzed the numbers."
A short discussion will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have an opportunity to ask the US President directly, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to make this happen often, and you can see it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the President of the United States will replace a short press conference."
The Trump regularly gives answers to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with host officials.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performances were before the media.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has sent a letter to EU personnel employed in the Scottish NHS to express appreciation and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to lower the costs of raising the housing requirements for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “Over the years negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawals have continued, moving towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult period for all of you.
So now I would like to come back to how valuable the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and throughout the world, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
Line player of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury in a Saturday defeat by the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a result of 31 1⁄2 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Chief trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the mid-term.
"He came to the game line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie some oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on their clothes and sent it on further searches.
The representative of the state University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there is no "detailment of the species/defence of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it came to the injury.
Abercrombie, a third-year student from two years of the game course, plays the first season for Tennessee State after a departure from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five rounds before leaving the game, which reached 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be paid a higher fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
This step will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase of fees will be intended for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Riznica expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today declare that foreign buyers will be paid more fees when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success in drawing young voters' promises to ensure a more satisfactory state-of-the-art solution and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in fees will be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat unemployment.
An additional fee which is collected from the current fee, including an increase which was introduced two years ago to other homes and real estate purchases for distribution may be up to three per cent.
It is expected that 120 million pounds will be collected this time of year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built estates in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, increasing prices and difficulties for purchasers who buy the first real estate to join the company of those who own their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become “the cities of spirits” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of fees to help more young people get home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking or not using the country, and called on Mrs May to withdraw from the quota on price-responsive real estate in order to correct "degradation due to the situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and at least none of the challenges.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to rehabilitate the British dream and that every new generation should be better.
And that's what it means to fix our collapse in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build life.
However, it cannot be true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies born abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of owning a house has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still so real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is one day to become director of Scotland.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of raising a North-East Club, currently occupying a third place in the First League, with three points less than the leaders.
This summer he moved to the St. Mirren after the last season was again taking St. Mirren to the Scottish football club.
"I wanted to become my country as a player.
I got B cap and that's it," Ross said for BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
But this opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in managing the club."
The Russian presidents at Sunderland's office include Dicka Advocata, David Moyes, Sama Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roya Keanea, Gusa Poyeta and Paula Di Cania.
Former Chief Allo Athletic says he didn't feel afraid because he inherited so well-known names in such a big club, after he had previously rejected calls at Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably think myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross is only in his third year of managerial career, after a period during which he was the assistant head of Dumarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the descent to the winner of the title of the first following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably the right thing to do," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed that managing is what matters to me more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I made a good effort, made a solid profit and enjoyed pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and stress, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to control it, and now I do it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the point is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, how it shows research
The summer heat wave increased the arrivals of British pubs who suffered from financial suffering, but it increased pressure on restaurant ranges.
The data show that pubs and baroques have achieved an increase of income in Serbia by 2.7%, but income in restaurants has been reduced by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the Business Counsellor’s Office, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of English time and participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that Serbia would be similar to the previous month of June when the poppies grew by 2.8 percent, with the restaurants now being even more hit.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant's income in June has only increased in July.
Pubs and barers where the main drinking services were made much more out of the same conditions than the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed beer shops and bars the sale of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent over the month and the sale of food supplies by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for rest and recreation, said: "These results continue to be the trend we see from the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to deal with difficulties, although the decline of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful because of constant cost pressures.
A long summer could not come in the worse time for local leaders serving food, and the time will show whether the temperature we experienced in the boat would be more moderate than necessary."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of the growth of slave brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with a total circulation of over 9 billion pounds, and is an industrial reference value.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that are hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “false Instas” pages
The news increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students reported having a "main" account showing their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, opens up a secret account on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Insts” account ↓ references to the web site for sharing photos.
The news increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a clear "main" account to show their parents and at the same time have private accounts.
One mother who found on her 13-year-old daughter's Web site found a teenager who was moved by the other words "patriot me".
A study conducted by the Digital Avarences UK and the HMC of independent schools showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which recognise that they own private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletes Committee
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Committee as an executive director at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most famous Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to take advantage of her extensive experience gained at international level during the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really bring sports to Scotland."
The American who won a 200-400-foot race in the 1996 game in Atlanta, from his total four Olympic gold, and now he's a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic attack he couldn't walk anymore.
He wrote on Twitter: “The first month I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time I'm gonna show myself how I'm gonna get better.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, he learned to walk again, and today he's working for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on advertising for a traitor who compares mothers to cows
A company for the production of a publisher by its advertising which compares mothers who raise their children to cows that have been encouraged by the museum to share their views on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product for which it is claimed to be "the first silent carrier of the world's publisher", Elvie published a commercial inspired by the Iranian music video to show the freedom that the new publisher gives to mothers.
The four mothers dance in a room full of blue and cows with their voice: "Yes, I'm my husband, but you don't see any rap" and "If you haven't noticed, this doesn't know, it's my chest."
Then follow the refresher: "Exposure, blow, feed the baby, blow, blow, blow my wife's husband."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has raised controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, videotape has received a mixed response from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "dangerous" dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use claims for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to work and work to produce milk, except for their children stealing a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie's dealer is discrepancies in breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Ideally traumatic for the mother and the child.
But why don't you use them to advertise for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "Tomorrow free advertising."
The other stood up to the announcement that one woman admitted that her song was “a joke. ”
"I think this is a wonderful idea.
If I had another baby, I'd have bought one.
The delivery of milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I realized it as well as it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is fun advertising focused on mothers who deliver milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘ cow’.
This is not a commercial that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet publishers located in pregnant women.
The concept of campaigns is based on the knowledge that many women who practice milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely silent, there are no wires or pipes, and she suddenly fits into the breastpiece for breastfeeding, allowing women to move freely, keep their babies, and even go out during delivery.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “The publisher Elvie is so revolutionary that he deserves courage and motivation.
The right parallel between the showing of women and cows we wanted to focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time on fun and understanding ways to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that the new issuer will bring.
This isn't the first time that traitor Elvie got to the address.
During London's weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion bridge for designer Mart Jacubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants increased although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trup administration made it difficult to accommodate children under the sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to threaten their own ability to stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested ten people who reported for sponsoring a minor without follow-up.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the previously arrested were not recorded in the criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of sponsors' households in the country are illegal and most of them are criminal strangers.
That's why we keep looking for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to the authorities, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear by means of a video conference call, rather than personally, in order to bring their case to legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to a worker's report in the shelter and reports that have appeared from the system of recent months, where long-term children remain in prison, it is more likely that they will become pregnant or depressed, which can lead to violent results or attempts to escape.
The prosecutors said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, because of his size, it is very likely that signs of child suffering will occur.
They added that moving children to a city without enough time to get emotionally ready or to greet friends can lead to a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Moulem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the parties were on the Syrian ground illegally, under the pretext of fighting against terrorism, and that they would "conform and act with them".
"They have to withdraw immediately and unconsciously," said the congregation.
Moulem insisted that "war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, while millions were left without their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "the battle in this world as long as all Syrian territories are not cleared" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war of the country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were fulfilled and he blamed "some Western countries" for "the spread of irrational fears" which encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be a clear humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helping to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last great rebellion against Idliba is an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive attacks of the Syrian forces with Russia's support for the province in which three million people live.
Moulem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear hands" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the Nursra front fight connected with Al-Qaid, "which will be rectified".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to gather soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and opposition in order to form a follow-up constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moulem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the desire for trust should be limited to "in the revision of the current Constitution" and warned against involvement.
Why Trump's gonna win another command
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-elections unless many liberal observers are likely to hope, opposition and scandal soon end his presidency.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's death.
Since 2014, the impact assessment has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost doubled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the attack period, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show has increased its attention to nearly 3.5 million viewers for evenings of broadcast news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
It is remembered by a train taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered, "Because he's laughing at me," said Mrs. Scowell.
There's a fun value in the cheese.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the Roe Prostique against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that you can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, you miss the level of the informed citizen when you realize that you've been seeing a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", about which Paul Manaforta from his feet worth $15,000" (the "indistinct object filled with bathousness", writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this is the anatomism of Mr. Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Maria again.
"A part of what he thinks you experience as a reality show is something to feed you every evening," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creation of the "Zalagaonica" show on the rotating playful position and every day's problems of Trump's show (combating N.F.L., thanking Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episode because you're gonna stay.
When I arrived this week at Mr. Fleissa, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai was sunned at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watched MSNBC and at the same time filmed CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate's Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was up to the end.
"I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it seemed they were right."

The money outflows into the most unexplained mid-term election course for Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money on 17th, thanks to the overhaul of the convention areas which resulted in two candidates running for the same place.
This recently renovated area of the building part of Pittsburgh stands for Democrat Conora Lamba , who has won a place in the second district in the special elections last year.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circuits had been illegally converted into the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th round launched a fight to fund the campaign between the main foreign financial fund collectors, the Committee which collects funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the widely followed special wedding elections for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point front.
Political analysts have given the unknown priority to democracies.
The United States is concerned whether El Salvador should be punished for providing support to China and then withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to call on US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said journalist Heather Nauert.
However, penalties are only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million US aid in 2017 for, among others, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted visa limitation, would be diseases for the Central American country and high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to continue to bring about a similar gathering last year, which was considered to be progress in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually discontinued any consideration of El Salvador's sentences.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now banned for mid-November, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new serious messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House speaker, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the terms of anonymity.
Their report confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next preparation could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible suspension of the court of Trump, which now has very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also directed his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If most changes are made in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is ready to go back before the voter, and perhaps in the end and with his jury alike.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Truma's fall is inevitable - even those similar to it in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German journalists were ready to carry out a state attack on Hitler, just because the West opposed and supported Chechslovak in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of generations that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the unwarranted march of democracy is slowing down or late.
The Americans are now facing a few of these points of inflation.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fired the deputy of the state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that last year he secretly proposed a film of the president and suggested his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says Tim's report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recent FBI investigation of British Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep long winter dreams.
But I believe we won't fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once settled in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles for shady on that crimson table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Becha
The Rangers are home to Rapid from Becha on Thursday, knowing that it will win them over the Austrians, after an impressive remier in Spain against Villallrela this month, to stand in position to qualify from the G European League.
The damage of the knee prevented Lieutenant Graham Dorrance from first appearing in the season to the 2 1⁄2 2 series with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a dropboard for larger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal was a good opponent," said a 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled out the point.
We may eventually have been able to steal the game, but, generally seen, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they've had a good outcome in the last game, but with the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, among other things what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it's ruling a good feeling.
Boys are good and boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of peace
Despite the fact that the researchers had a clear view of the kind of care they want, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of the researchers at the Nationalwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Wide Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for giving care if you do not express your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and your family to talk about where and how to take care of them, since choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Collect your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Get medical representatives to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals are satisfied with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving plenty to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions in your name and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not in a position to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires emergency medical intervention and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hands."
A man shot more than once from an Air Gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot more than once in an airgun while he returned home after the night's departure.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, chest and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunamis and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the officials reported, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
Since communications have been interrupted, aid officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donghre province, the area north of Palu, which is close to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Doghrei, on the island of Sulawesia:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by floods and tsunamis.
Doghera is a circle that covers more than 300 km of the coast on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesian.
The area, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, particularly the coastal regions of Doghrea.
Nikala mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palu and Doghre were hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghrey.
Tsunami also hit West Doha in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Fire Zone and is regularly discussed by the Commission.
Here are some of the main floods and tsunamis in recent years:
2004.: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005.: A series of strong attacks hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of the marriage and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006.: 6.8 degrees hit southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009.: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010.: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters to destroy ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: The plague hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the outbreak of deadly plague and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn't get to the tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of the building.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President, Sarah Palin, is arrested for the charge of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Vasilla, Alaska, has been arrested for suspicion of family violence, harassment of family violence and refusal of arrest, is reported in a report published on Saturday by the state police officer of Alaska.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su prison and is held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
He appeared at the court on Saturday, where the issue of an explanation of the crime was "unless, of course", the network reported.
The fuel is loaded for three Class A infringements, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with breaking class B, which is sentenced to one day in prison and fines of $2000.
It's not the first time that the charges have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with family violence, harassment of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Saru Palin criticised the Veteran Group in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and floods in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted, and in the next days the number of dead is expected to rise.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of Central Sulawesian, north of the main city of Indonesia Jakarte.
The social networks are surrounded by videotapes showing the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for suspects for a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfulla Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight persons have died of a rare penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck for renting Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle race along the West Side road in Donja Manhattan, where he crossed the sands and bicycles that were on his way to November
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intended" killed eight victims and "dangerous" committed a serious physical injury, according to a report on the intention of seeking a death penalty, which has been imposed in the southern part of New York.
Both of these points lead to any death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal major jury of Saipov attacked a 22nd-point prosecutor who included eight charges of murder and assault, which federal prosecutors usually use in case of organised crime, as well as allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "faint planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saip's conduct it as "grunt, cruel and dishonest".
"Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saip has caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enriquea Angelinia, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," says a report on the plan.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's southern district last trial of the death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
She was sentenced to death last in a federal case in New York in 1953 when her husband, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were murdered after they were sentenced to a term of imprisonment for spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 at an electric chair.
According to the judicial documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of punishment in the days and months after the attack.
He told the researchers that he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS videotape on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he said to the prosecutor.
He also asked for ISIS to report to his hospital room, the police reported.
It's clear that it's not the fault of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were "exactly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty, not to accept confession of life in prison without the possibility of release, will only increase the flow of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipovjev's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
Parliamentary Conservative says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the national army" today during a conference of conservatives.
The former Head of the Independent Party of the United Kingdom said that politicians had to "feel pressure" the Eurosceptics, since one of the members of the Theres May Parliament proposed that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom had so far been "out" that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in resolving her deeply divided lines highlights the remaining remnants who join a special campaign against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its "Checkers" compromise plan in the middle of the Brexit attack, the rest of the EU.
The Union has insisted that it will continue its efforts to agree with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and labists to choose between its package and "kaos".
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihululu that he wanted to "reject the Chechers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been entitled and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was the head, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we have to get the checks out."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world's wars to be born.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the statement that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to stay is completely wrong."
Conservatives and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkins were also in trouble, speaking to journalists: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Checkers is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our country and among our activists who were actually and were those who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please turn off the checks and start listening."
In an impressive message, Mrs May added: "The Prime Minister keeps his place of work when he fulfills his promises."
Farage told the audience that politicians must make themselves "feel pressure" if they are willing to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "That won't happen to you."
In an encouraging letter, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s publishing, to feel pressure.
We mobilize this country's national army that has given us victory in Brexit and we won't calm down until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remains were marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour assembly in the city center.
The majority of activists were smaller than the "Torriers against Brexit" after the launch of this week's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis begged conservatives for security problems that had been faced with the application of the client during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the "Canada plus" plan for an unrestricted state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete fresco.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to "exactly consider" to apply for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that "the candidate will be seriously considered" after the study elections.
Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the election in a studio against Republican Geoffrey Diehl, who was vice president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been a while in the middle of speculation to resist the 2020 trumpet.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took up his duties.
The witness asked her if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, and that's understandable to a woman."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday that she arrested the suspect in a death shooting at the State University of Louisiana (LSU) by Wayde Sims, which happened on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday they published a murder record, asking for help in identifying a man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday at the campus near the University of Southern.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result," said chief of police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wade was involved in protecting his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was tested and admitted he was at the crime scene and owned a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to prison in the Japanese police East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year-old student of 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches in 10 first positions last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and achieved 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps after the match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world's first after his order guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that team leader "will play a major role in the race".
From the beginning, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his team member.
The winner first went into the box and left Hamilton to get in the van at first, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into box one round later and went out behind the Vettela, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the driver on the trigger which caused Ferrari's driver to leave the free interior in danger of staying behind after a double move in defense of the third.
Max Verstappen left the last row and was seven to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he turned his tires to reach a quick finish and crossed the Kimmy Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally got into box on the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up his pace in the other eight circles while Raikkonen took a fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtter had been doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done a really great job to get a training finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein as a whole on Saturday because she insisted that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in public accusing the candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly forget the testimony of the Forum before the Senate's Legal Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad and vicious and unfair".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't.
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave any information?
Remember her answer... did you leave a document in the public -- ‘Aaaaa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein in Serbia sent a letter with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which he investigated earlier in September - but Feinstein demanded that information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story in public," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret, which she asked for."
However, her resignation did not come upon the president’s approval, who, at the meeting on Saturday evening, commented: “Let me tell you something - that was a very bad thing of the body.
Maybe it isn't, but I've never seen a hot body speech in my life."
Continuing its defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democracy be used for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return the government at every price.
You see evil, greed, no interest in who will harm them, who must be overlooked to come to power and control," said the President, media spokesman.

The air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape traffic
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was announced by a hero after he died while he secured a safe flight of aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were killed as they were after a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Powerful earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place of work in the control tower of Muteara Sis Al Jufri who was deeply ill.
He remained to secure the safe flight of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the bridge.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was running.
He moved to the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are ashamed of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster mitigation agency says there is limited access to the cities of Doghrei, Sigiya and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, since many bodies are still under debris, and to many it can't even come," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves that reached the height and blew up to six meters of the Pala in which the mass drop will be held on Sunday.
War and commercial aircraft provide help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “The emergency aid takes every minute from the body.
The government condemns clean water.
All over the place, little shops are stealing."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is driving with survivors, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo travelled to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: “Please do all you can to work day and night to complete all the evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is running like a missing man after the plane crash in the camp
The Aircraft Company owned by the owner of the aircraft which landed in the peaceful bay in Micronesia now claims that one man is running away as if he had disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safe evacuated from the plane that had landed.
In his statement, Air Niugini said I can't track one of the passengers from Saturday afternoon.
The airlines reported cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their efforts to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
The officials announced on Friday that seven persons were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were kept in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all stable.
What caused the fall and the exact outcome of the events remained unknown.
The Air Company and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft landed in a cabin near the bridge.
Some fathers thought the plane missed the gun.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to get through the water that got them to the point of exit in case of the danger of the plane he hit.
He said the studs were panicking and screaming, and he suffered less head injury.
A U.S. Navy reported that mariners working near the port repair site also helped save using a boat to launch people's transport on land before the plane hit about 30 meters of water.
The aviation security network data show that 111 people have died in the accident of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, but not one of them has been included in Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a time review of the night in which a woman burned alive
The prosecutor concluded on Saturday the case in the retrial of a man who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
The jury described how he used cell data to compose a statement on the move of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on her death night.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was located at the same location as Chambersin during his own claims with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to examine Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When his prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "astounded because his truck was in Nashville."
Another setback was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data showed that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from the phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The "The High Breed" group from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has been far from its beginnings fulfilled by political messages and turning to social issues.
They want to return to their roots and hip-hop to become popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are born again in Great Britain through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
Daddy from New York complains a couple for giving up after the "Rasistic" message
Dadila from New York complains about a discriminatory rejection after she received a wrong-oriented message from a mother named "one more black".
Some say they're racists, comparing the charge with "injurious".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when after her first working day in 2016 she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"No more CRNKINJA," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "disgusting" situation, and released Mrs. Maurice, as she claims, because their ex-Afro-American girlfriend was already doing her job badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, she transferred New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work and then she went home.
Maurice now sues a couple for a cancellation fee and seeks compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she is initially engaged, even without a contract.
"I want to show them I can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reiterated the claim that they were racist, saying that the end of Mauritian's employment was wise to be done, because of the fear that she will not be able to believe after the injury.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent to her.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"But would you believe your children to whom you were not entitled, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in "very difficult situation".
"You will accuse someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," added an investment banker.
Although the court procedure is still under way, a court of public opinion has quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be exposed to the bear speaking, found in a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: “It’s hard to put into the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very funny what we know now about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, who had worked as a BBC photographer before the little bear inspired him to write a book, was optimistic when he wanted to be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, described as “a very important member of the family”, she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite these men and he wasn't grateful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was experienced as someone who would achieve his own child: you are proud of him even though none of that is really your job.
I think Paddington's success looked that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, the merit has always been attributed exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter died, and we had to apologize by phone.
After she was diagnosed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors deliberately tried to save her life.
"He regularly called over to say it's really bad and to believe he won't get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die within two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medicines that her doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually lost the effect and left her body system.
She died a little before she was picked up, and then everything went off.
I just had to sit down and wait knowing what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in my head."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was then in mourning for the loss of her daughter, flew into the plane with other passengers - who were not aware of her experience.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears always followed my face.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a strong sense of justice for Nadu on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's messages in mourning at the bridge with a view to preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a large bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infected smile waiting for a career flash.
"They all remembered him after his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was in “a really dark state. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found a brother after you took this life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “to make people know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit still and talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his partner with whom he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was on his own floor when the children opened gifts, he didn't even look at them, nor did he want anything else."
She said that his death was a tragedy for them, but they had to overcome it: “All of this leaves a huge void in the family.
Let's go.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on the end of the FBI's investigation
"I thought we might be able to unite a little unit if we really succeeded in getting something like what he asked for  However time and extensive limited research," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding how he was afraid that the committee would "fall" in the middle of the heated foreign blockade.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want an FBI investigation?
Their plight is motivated by a moment's choice.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks, 6th November if, what is expected to happen, the Republicans are not going well, then they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling on the senator, welcoming them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, Vice-President, to break the decisive vote and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'opa' under the leadership of Kima
The number of escapes from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling on data from the Ministry of the United South Union, Park Byeong-Seug said there was 1127 flights last year compared with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that key drivers are stricter controls on border crossings between North Korea and China and more fees paid by criminals to people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the escapes from the north to the end were obtained by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China escapes the view of illegal migrants, not refugees, and often resorts to violence.
Relations between the North and South which are still technical in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang at talks focused on previous negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed to work in a broad sense to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, charged US sanctions that they have not made any progress since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take into account that we are first exposed under such circumstances," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "historic", says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court judge Britta Kavanaugh "historic" and said that because of his temper he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought that a woman would, if she had ever behaved like this, be called a 'historic'," Pelosi described his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally depressed the claim that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally screaming and laughing while discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned democracies in the committee, calling it a "grotesque and coordinated rounding" that organised liberal angers that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed that he had prejudices against democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself in such statements and in the way that Mrs Clinton and Democrats are attacking," she said.
The question is whether he will try to call Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of the House of Representatives, Pelosi is confused.
"I'll say next if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not possible not only to be in the Supreme Court but not in the court where he is now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat he was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Act of Accession or the law on the transfer of a protest from Roe's procedure against Wade, because he is considered conservative judges.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh has raised questions about whether he will change some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical, stubborn person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticisms, anger that has been collected for months and years can't be eliminated without payment.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steine to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continues: “The woman who once was the executive director and who said how she was crying when she was upset, but she developed the technique that when she was angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said: ‘ You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as an exit for anger, partly because they are basically misinformed.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in the office where men were dominateed, is how I was, once when I cried because of an unexplained rage, an old woman who was always a bit afraid of getting back to the station.
"Don't ever let him see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, now a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an ex-ship on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"That wasn't a good idea," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need one more.
Someone called them "Snuggle and seven patrols".
Since the campaign has already been slowed down, it has remained with the collection of funds, and it has been said that it will not get into the race unless it collects $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the men who gave her $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a break?" she asked.
While she said she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions about the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to collect money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and anger over the sexism that pushed her.
"You would think I had experienced a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what it's gonna put on my memorial.
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China has voted out loud and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between the country can be from the use of Beijing in a long period of time, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, launched his first warning earlier this year, repressing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale in this week has appeared with new tariffs that have affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) in fact, reversing half of all goods coming into the United States of China.
Beijing has returned in some way, and recently it has been introduced from five to ten percent to 60 billion US dollars.
China promised that the US would respond to the hit, and the second largest global economy will certainly not be delivered soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be met by the release of requests, but the US's public obedience would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards well, American trade forces can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing mutual dependence on two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the movement of economic extremism in both countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific thinker who focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of a refugee, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that destroyed the war that lasted for more than seven years.
Turning to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said how conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to create a normal situation.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were focused on their daily life and existence are now fulfilled.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would be well able to help restore the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that sponsored rebellion.
Europe won Ryder's buy in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning the US final result of 16.5 1⁄2 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times together on the European ground and have not won Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the crown again while Danish Captain Thomas Bjorna's team has reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered during almost all the tournaments, sent a ball in the water at the first strike, leaving the sword Francesca Molinaria.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament began this format.
American Jordan Spietha threw Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest ranking player of European boys, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of England Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder buy.
Veteran 8 Ryder's purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the Europljanian with the most winning tournament with 25,5 points won in career.
"I usually don't pay, but I can't stop the tears today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the purchase again.
I'm happy I could help," said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He carries the bag to his cousin John Ramu who in a single game on Sunday won the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, result 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride about winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four shots in France and now he has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder's purchase.
The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, are right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justina Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American Captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At some point, we have provided Europe with resistance.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Captain Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Committee, so we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to pull the cap off people.
We're excited."
