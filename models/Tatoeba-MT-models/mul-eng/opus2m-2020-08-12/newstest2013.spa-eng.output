A Republican strategy to impede Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a radio.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
In contrast to what is happening in Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American Governments have promulgated, since 2009, new laws that have made it difficult for the registration or voting process to take place.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to be registered as a elector on the day of the Scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with previous criminal status.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity document with photographs.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian Act in 2008.
As a result, the Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to present a photo-recognition identity document.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of the age of vote, do not have any ID document issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack a identity document with these characteristics.
However, often the receipt of the required identity document is more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, some 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of persons under $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most to democratic candidates cannot use the identity document with photographs issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who often vote in the Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004 no state required citizenship evidence to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures, of course, seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of the three Spanish voters support the democratic party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished electoral registration on the same day of the Scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to create a service of assistance to voters who would like to be enrolled.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, at the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved that the registration rate for new voters falls in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the period of vote in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of the Spaniards, the same would be true.
These represent only 11 per cent of voters, equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, which represent 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic rulers have blocked several bill projects.
The U.S. Tax Ministry intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo identity document.
However, it is inevitable that the new rules adopted will make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democrats claim the party's character of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college for the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostitution cancer detection: Whether or not to test?
In fact, the PSA test presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which unnecessary medical interventions are decided.
It's more than enough reason to suspect men, already retinal of themselves, about whether or not detection tests should be performed.
Whether to do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from the specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, a large number of samples were found among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had been diagnosed and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also showed that there were between 30 and 40 per cent chance of metastasis falling if the detection test had not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Afro-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other incurable cancers.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the degree of risk of his cancer. All possible options should be offered to him and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not concern long-term life, in which case he should be chosen better by active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active monitoring of the disease and, if this progress is made, we offer them treatment.
We increasingly define the criteria necessary to determine who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and contrasts of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, about 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a Canadian Society spokesman against Cancer.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others are still completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
The tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today for today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
One hopeful date: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fatigue and obesity also promote the presence of disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and right cancer, esophagus, pancreas and ulcer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering a colorectal cancer.
Charcot products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat for its ahumid, dried or salted meal may cause the formation of cancerous substances.
"May damage the organism's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Las vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamins and cancer.
However, its investigations have not yet been completed.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in risk of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs Detailed Box
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' bosses generated a great shock last summer, and rightly.
In fact, it is believed that this boss is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, this is the particle whose existence was foretold by the standard model: our better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it's not quite clear that it's Higgs.
We know without question that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like Higgs' boss named by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical convention held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is needed to be fully secure.
In any case, let's assume that it's Higgs, because there are few ways to make mistakes, and we'll see what's going on.
There is, in this great world, a generalised and inalienable law that implies that two things cannot be found at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too much, because it will end up harming itself.
Although the physical nature of the particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantistic state"; a "state" which consists largely of some of its characteristics.
Physicals classify particles in two categories.
On the one hand we meet with the good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And by the way, they are the bosses, a sushi panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, of course, is extraordinary, the bison are divided into two groups: the months, of which we will not speak here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature are exposed and which Higgs' bison would be in some way compatible.
These bisons, they could subray here, they're not the exotic bees we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this Chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinary wave of bananas: the photon or the "light particles" that acts as a "message" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an accelerated electrical load or direction change, "ordinate" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little as when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the boons "force porters".
A more stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boss, unlike that of another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "unsorted" for this boss to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To enable it requires it to reach extremely high energy levels, a little as if it were an ice stank in which only a gray rock could be depleted by the surface.
That is why there is a huge need to accelerate particles like the CERN (the great hemisphere colliser is a 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the Imams, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself at the door of a nest.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (like the photo, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations bring?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to draw out the differences between MS observations and predictions.
On the other hand, many desperately wish to be found, since the smaller difference could open a door to a "new physics" that shuts down certain angles of the model.
This must be said, there are still huge shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation of gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong by saying that there will be no one.
For them to see: At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories had no doubt about the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked at Bell's labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pushed) in 1962, the laser was considered a "laboratory device" at first.
Can not open message
In addition, applications can also come from all instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although its original intention was not at all, this captureer now serves as "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was valued by the Nobel of physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC want to necessarily transform our lives, but it is never known...
Palitative care. The best way to die... ► Le Dubor
In his Death Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed as soon as a draft law is drawn up.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Debor has tried to find him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived only in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"They've given me five years of life, but I've already taken seven of them," he reports, taking a walk, buried in his bed at the center of the Victor-Gadbois paralytic care in Beloeil, which came the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
The disease has caused him harm: a serious weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetitey breakfast, accept it remanded to help you eat.
Valentie, even smiles, talk to strangers who pay attention to him, take drugs and offer him a bath.
The valley of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," she says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that disease.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does bad things," reports Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the center of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept that rejection," he said.
Because, according to the majority of people working in palliative care, the great moments have a place in the heart of that regression itself.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and exhausted".
But the disease has made her discover to her children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"There are no more desires in this life," she says, before she accepts a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, the next few days, for a last visit of her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
They're palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very rare, because we all know we're gonna end up dying someday.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it is physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
At death they are offered oral syringes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served him a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the patients and their loved ones," says Nathalia Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever equal.
Along the side of a 94-year-old man who enjoyed his last family meeting in the patio, well placed between his grandparents while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old boy dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three or five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer," worried Dr. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient comes to the final phase of his life, either at home, at the hospital or at a care centre.
And a number of agencies, such as Victor-Gadbois Center and the company of palliative care at the Grand Montréal home, are almost exclusively specialized in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely that great lack of health care in Quebec, which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by emissaries of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," she reports, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care."
And in parallel, many oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
Hélène Richard's prospects for survival were at least as low as he gave up an autistic chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my uncle he wanted to stop the treatment, she told me he was very sorry I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing more to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely absolute in terms of treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal’s home, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sitting, which is used to sleep for up to the time of their death, either in a sporadic or permanent manner.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, chronic illness will have the possibility of having that palliative seating.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want it to relieve me."
The implementation of this report has been possible through a periodical of Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the transport network, BTP businessmen, political party funders and Italian mafia specialists have, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system" of which they are part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafios.
A "industrial" which went too expensive for Quebec contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's a curious result of how the system is pulverized once we've been hunting the big media," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, who is a member of Quebec and former Chief of Montreal Police.
He led the set-up of the 2011 scandal, which was possible through a thorough investigation into the distortions of road contracts in Quebec, which the first liberal minister, Jean Charest, had allowed at that time to delay.
The "Report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved thousands of dollars in contracts," including some of its intentions to stay with a proportion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has fallen to two alcalades", adds, while it is expected to be able to "show existing strategists behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies to its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works in addition to the police of "the Marteau Army", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the canal" modernizes at the time of entering into contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in a series of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the suburbs.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just left his post as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated subsidies have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers from the Montreal road network and Italian businessmen, such as Tony Accursso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has been shocked to explain to the Commission the "system" mechanism for the acquisition of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of contracts received in Montreal to an intermediator related to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to register and syndicate during the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former prime minister of liberalism, Nathalia Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of reaching contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and corporate funerals in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for promotional contracts whose costs have affected.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to infuse the invoices between a 30% and a 40% in terms of extra fraud.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberating on a parallel budget and filling his dirty money sheets.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first election policies that made the alarm sound.
As a mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $5 million and sold by 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was dirty money
Of the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she draws "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by hormones, to stop the gangrene and to fish for the criminals".
And it adds that the process is "serious but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but there would be a need for a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned about the role of "political elected to the current of the strategy".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, it ironizes: "They have told me that that is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit contributions to $100 to parties, but that will not change the donation, he said, "until electoral costs are strictly limited, there will be money lost in politics".
It calls for a complete review of the award system of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall below; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story is accompanied by the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who wish to look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would I explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness-taking but also by the new size of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-to-day advance to your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements force me to raise the level of my game every day.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't like it.
From my beginnings at the InF Clarefontaine training centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are accustomed to arguing very high-level parties.
They know that each training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and do everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has a lot to do with my position.
He's supported by supporters like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and there is among the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think there'll be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
At League 1, Lyon has taken us out of the lead.
But we're still in the trunk.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have been classified for the final eights with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say to many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish our first link to the Opportunity so that we can receive the return of eight finals.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He's got the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris has to gain titles and be there for a long time.
Today for today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being delivered to its means for this project to be concrete.
Do not win the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in carrying out that title of seminars.
We don't get far in the last time.
In May we were disappointed, since we had excellent conditions to end first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better time.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if large teams such as Marsella, Lyon and the Burdeos fight for the title, I think we're counting on weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at Troyes's house, which is still with things to blame for is a little frustrating.
We're wondering what's waiting for people.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the League of Champions we have demonstrated that we can respond and be present.
They look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not been able to classify for eight finals, and they have also invested very much!
In view of the invested sums, we would imagine them with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be denying our opponents and the champion of France.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well the previous season, have seen "enforced" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is loving.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's success.
We'd better say we have a Zlatandependence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and puts a lot of balls.
It's come to prove it's the star of League 1.
And it's proved in all the teams that have happened that it's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
That moves others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all of us to make progress.
How have you lived the Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got strengthened.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learn the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary conduct today.
What do you see in the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the blues?
You are receiving results.
They are well placed in the World ranking group.
The selector is tight, close to players and inspired to win.
Like Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc has achieved its goal of classifying us for Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the election to Brazil.
Did the empath (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve as a base seat?
That game gave us confidence.
Every one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never had a game like that in my whole career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is currently a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to that.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded using 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The cost of the bitcoin, after reaching $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $25 later five months before returning to $10 today (the rates are focused on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not surprising if we compare it with the world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or purchased (even on changing occasions).
The social Facebook network has also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency stations and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is distributed across the network.
The key point is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a type of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital sheet.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "drop" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular needle (more accurate at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the threshold.
If, to make a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphan, since both have different branches.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to hundreds of millions, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also reflected in each increase in the ability to calculate.
The network's life already has its seniors.
Websites offering Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The used case does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the money actually presents the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse this kind of payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of non-circular bitcoins.
In November the giant rebels were launched.
"Must 30,000 dollars have been changed," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns gold bitcoins.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes enough in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which will make it cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to run in trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It's enough to provide them with an address that a phone can "photo and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general motion for review of rail systems by more horizontal systems.
"There will be a time for Bitcoin to push, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, which are considered high today, if this money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for any of us.
We have particularly punished Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And for ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former leaders who have been refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, such as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the Yihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks or Thais are united for their reasons.
Tolerance, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, will no longer be done when Westerners become more discreet.
The start of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which observed from the top of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influence in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irreversible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country surrounded by fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its control of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of their camps overrun by Al-Qaeda, but their situation is no better today.
The old Muyhadins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, working with governmental lands to re-sell them as suns for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the couple of huge subcontracting contracts in the United States.
They are untrustworthy; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, hope for a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of the American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
Those young people who will not want to return to the dark of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to work.
All, including the armed opposition, are prone to mobile phones. The television and its Turkish follettes presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will run from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, a country of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations; however, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, with a strong presidential power, removing the position of the first minister who existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has resettled its services, no packaging has been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing but fruits and vegetables are produced.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The noise that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth was spreading.
And that only increased the sense that the Westerners were there to take possession of them.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavating the vast building site and staying there as the most important employees of the province.
There will also be a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country in which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore their normal relations.
The French troops broke up on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: colleges of girls, colleges of children, a French department at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "get the hearts and spirits" and carrying out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was removed in 2012, brought and carried through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain sites.
These works, eager to obtain local work, have helped to contain insurrection: rice, posos, potable water, forestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increased crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they wish would require a small civil, well-controlled and direct assistance.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play everything.
He took the whole world by surprise at Wednesday, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given more than two months to that Assembly to complete its work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial abuses.
This new initiative has done more than increase the country's fracture.
For its opponents, the President will continue in his "autocratic delirie" and will continue "training his word" and "pesitating the law".
On the part of its partners, it is ensured that this is a step towards a faster end to the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short time limit for the brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover popular and democratic legislation while the politicism causes harm throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour of him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that such a resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the people of Egypt: "They either vote or I hold the full powers," powers that they will supposedly reach their end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment where 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, Islamist in most of them, voted yesterday.
The majority of the Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not evaluate their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, alternate members, were added to all arrests by tomorrow.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As I had hoped, the articles voted have been unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been practically expressed at the time of the prayer, so that several members of the Committee have come to think that the clock of the Constitution was wrong.
The text, which was still voting yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of all views, which continues to be entirely identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The Liberals treat it as hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a advertising art.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for all those who must confirm their compliance with the law of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the prizes of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also compounded by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not ignorant but university students, some of whom are formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blueet, who prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition to Egypt.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisdiction, etc.].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to speak above all of this."
In addition to its religious nature, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms about the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those in the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military wish, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered liberality.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, abuses are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, the Heba Morayef subsidized by Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the President of Egypt should go out at night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The party members of the Head of State appeared on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world’s siege and a salt sea
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone entering this "baptismal pill" is thought to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the turning of water into wine into wine, walking over the waters, the watering of the storm and the full networks.
In this same location, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of sacred places is located in Jerusalem.
The believers refer here to the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Via Painful Life").
Starting at the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continuing through the streets of the Old City, he goes to the Holy Sepulcro in Mount Golgota, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Assembly of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of the Lamentation; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people from different religions leave no note here with their desires, which will then become reality.
Make a vertical journey
The destruction of the Masada Fortaleza was what remained of a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great sent to build in 25 A.C. for his family.
The mountain canals are located at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to reach there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to the ladder.
The others can reach this historic summit at the funeral.
And in the north of the country to a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
To that end, bus services are offered from the top of the hill.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they were supposedly inhabited by pagan gods.
Visit individual museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On a single trip you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israel Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Scrolls of Qumran discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological parts.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings there are impressionists and expressors such as Montet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagal or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing by the exclusive private Ralli museum, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or memorial stores there.
The entry is free, and no donations are categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cameras.
Get into it and find you in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they call the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Hello
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea it is even in winter months, since the water temperature is not below 21 degrees and the air is warm up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there it swims throughout the year.
Of course, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below sea level.
Blue waters from there are a salamander that can easily sustain up to those who don't know how to swim.
The landscapes around them are really beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salted water, salt and curative bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their limited nerves.
Touching the mysteries of old age
It preserves them on the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
This led to the famous maritime route that led to Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, he was here where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets that carry the names of the signs of Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls along your "mism" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa there are recently married couples from all parts of Israel, including other countries to take photos.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, can be passed through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the crucified.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Remember Tourists
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country around 30% of the Russian-speaking population.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed into shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a rapid transit and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's from a underground funnel.
Travel in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and can be traveled by boat for 1.5 hours at this price.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was celebrated.
From Friday night to Saturday's sun set, markets and shops will close and public transport will interrupt their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many coffee shops, restaurants and hotels only Kosher food is served, which includes beef, marisco, fish without any spasms and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There it offers a wide selection of dishes based on beef and veal meat, soups and pastries prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called Humus, great variety of salads, the falafel, which are soft wheat balls, fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of the Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many good-equipped cats that "go through their taste" unexpectedly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
Roofers love the places they're competing and don't reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides insurance, it'll be $15 a day.
And the rental of a bike will go out for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to take the country and rest were U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists, an amount exceeding 51 per cent of the same year 2010 index before the visa regime was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will lead you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the mandatory review law, they have already appeared in the country of terror dealing with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, San Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money to help your family who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law shall enter into force which requires each migrant worker to conduct an examination to verify his or her knowledge of Russian.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and trade at least.
However, in time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to make the language examination, if not also the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the working permit.
Citizens in countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Those who have obtained their education and diplomas before the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, feasibility and rights defence
The network of review centres will operate under the supervision of the Institute of Language Russian Pushkin, the University of Friends of the Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, even now in Russia more than 160 centres of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the Members of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, have often been able to ask the press this question: And what will it really bring?
What changes will bring about the obligation to know the language, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service are responding, which will reduce the number of people suffering "working slavery".
Many people are talking today about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of its rights must be initiated before its departure.
Only an organized selection system will address the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
They have problems with immigrants who do not know the language or have medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant's future will be condemned to find people who, with the intention of helping him, put a "paid travel" into a mirror and close-up, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised salaries," confirmed the Chief of the Employment Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't join me, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize not only that they do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go but also that they write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but your own tragedy: there are few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Thais who can give themselves the opportunity to receive normal primary education.
This is because your families don't even have anything to give children to eat, because they don't talk about wearing them anymore, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys are given the opportunity to work for the first time.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"If you're humble and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Come or ban the move to foreigners"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to tens of thousands.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand and fifty rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of torture.
"We ask hundreds or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented the journalists to the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Let's go, don't be a hostage, buy a painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was made clear that not only immigration registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been applied by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, new owners arrived not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the work of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and half dearer than the official review procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, public officials and rights defenders are convinced.
To date, the authorities can promise migrant workers that they could not successfully pass the examination for the first time in order to study the basic course of language.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigour in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: To shoot shots during weddings where there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, where APRT seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatized weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Combating Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on the possession of weapons would be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of kidnappers, demand that such measures be removed from "unreasonably dangerous".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, comments to the Russian BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms registered in internal organs were committed during six months of 2012 against the total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a more stringent legislation in the field of civil use weapons will not be an inconsistencies for the offender to be placed on the black market.
Now, according to your words, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Víctor Barantes, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Supreme State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms requests
The first one, "exceeding of the army or military", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals and representatives of security forces.
Baranets explains that here are the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are evidenced versions that some fires have been caused primarily to cover the lack," comments one expilatory.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their arena granite.
"They have now spread private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the black market is the smuggling.
A large number of guns and mortars come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they count on their own production, sometimes artificially, and a mafia that has organized the flow of weapons has been formed," explains the former military.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rossstat, criminal bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "on account of staff whose work is related to weapons", says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during arms production and 5 per cent corresponds to "illegal archeology".
The dependant of one of the arms stores, who asked for his address not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators did not buy them from anyone long ago because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are heading to military stores when they need a game.
Through some offers, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
Removes the register and passes it up the valley.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two carriers," we read
"But, of course, the police are doing so much of all matters, so periodically, when it is necessary to carry out the crime detection plan, they do test purchases for illegal arms dealers," the dependant adds.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are often found through know-how.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy I proposed was on the "Begovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would lead me to a "squirt" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I'll only get it there."
Military commentator Viktor Barantes
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's dependant. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are vendors in the markets, but there is also a need to come, say "by Mr Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter".
I can even get a couple of steel gloves through a trusted person.
He also provides them to me only because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of procuring illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when an article on this topic was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all".
"I felt like a luxury shop," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer cat for free: everything can be tried.
I, as potential customer, do not just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white one.
"It gives me the opportunity to shoot and when I'm sure the gun will shoot well, we'll start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where they are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any document or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write under the headline "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And they sell to younger people?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"Buy a TT. Moscú gun," lay down his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and capture two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
And the people go, like a wet piece to the grass, and then, to extract carbon in Siberia.
military commentator and exmilitar Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make requests.
The buyer pays through an automatic casket.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports NGO press secretary Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Barantes says that if an online request is made, one is left without a gun and is put in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and capture two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
"And the people go, like a stinking piece to the dust, and then, to extract carbon in Siberia," he says.
Macarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say, one can spend from $100 to 900.
According to the NGO Dmitri Kislov "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half is to be expected.
It's sent from military stores by middle rank leaders.
According to official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and destruction of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive artifacts decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast and supermarketed food restaurants in the U.S. are being launched.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as careers in "McDonald's"
In the last days, a wave of protests have been launched in the United States against low wages paid at Walmart's supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far no one dares to wonder if this wave will arrive at the nine points or if it is intended to lose forces and grow in its first stages.
The protests are supported by unions and a series of left NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages paid by Walmart's workers and those of the fast food system, the objective of the protesters' organizers is to create trade union unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six percent a year?
The actions began last week, after the Day of Action of Grace, called "Black Friday". That day in the United States began the retreating organ that captured millions of people, and that sometimes I was accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some Walmart corporate workers, who employed 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pitches with trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to low-income and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything, from clothes, hunting rifles and car batteries to fans, eggs and milk.
The products in their shops are medium between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the largest supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of mounts or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" required increased salaries and claimed that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation was from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases his average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost him $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it costs in wages now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase in consumer households, each visit to the store will only result in 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters comment on the satisfaction that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended into its shops from 8 p.m. to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its registered boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the Huffington Post website, which left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been more than "another call for public relations", organized by the union of workers.
"It's free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the objectives were not exactly the great Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and that is why there is no one now), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of pieces, and then they don't even give you the disease down and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumanee Williams, member of New York Municipal Council
Currently, in accordance with the federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of the American teenagers went through McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, for a partial time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly worry about some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to eat with them.
The participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 a.m. on the morning of Thursday at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food cassettes and cookers be paid at least $15 per hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. Act prohibits administration from banning this right and punishing union movement activists with arguments and charges.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
For objective reasons, however, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the mains is the excessive rotation of staff.
Reminders
Rudo protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the morning in McDonald's location near Times Square, where several local Democrats participated, in particular the municipal council member Jumane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example from the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the fast food sector workers in order to get fair wages and the economic prosperity worth each neo-Yorkino".
As New York Times described it, this has been the greatest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people in New York work.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a chip to cause massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of increased reality, so popular among those who are enthusiasts of modern technologies, is most commonly understood through the prism of special gafas.
At the beginning of the summer, at its Google annual conference, a model was shown in motion and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft lab at Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was made clear that for the scientists of that company, the gafas already belonged to a past stage.
They draw attention to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with the bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now mankind in its large mass has been trapped in the working phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes the touch with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and discover the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in control by gestures.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, most of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design.
The world of mathematics must be freed from making it more tangible to our physical, physical, and physical.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to the devil with those cascading knots of virtual reality!
- What do you think about control by voice?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they love it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's going to solve the issue of privacy, because it doesn't always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but everyone in their own field.
For example, in order to control devices in public places, we had a project on which we thought about gestures, but not on slow movements, but rather shorter.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device but by a pulse that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulse clock.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this soda bag?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Either you want to force users to adapt to what you can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have from modern cameras?
Do you lack a resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with tridimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps speed.
But the issue is not in megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer than the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects man-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work as an equivalent to that device, but it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually the infrared radio transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of visible range.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- That's why I remember Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his gloves to the public.
Does it not seem that from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, gafas are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, passing all the mouse while holding an intelligent phone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass out of your pockets to the smart phone,
Gafas are very personal devices, in which it is its strength (the private things you can only see), but also its weakness: an increased reality based on Gafas will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual clock objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the "Iron Man" film but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point to: there is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do you prepare your group for this challenge?
At my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakdown in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactical feelings.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at bringing tangiability to these "images in the air". For example, interfering with several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the mouth gives a similar feeling to one's feeling if someone was planning it on his fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulses for the mussel that affect the nerve endings of the teeth, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Do you make him think he feels what he thinks he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried.
Here there is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very limited space create that goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the giant globes.
For now, cheating on the brain is not that easy, it still has to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total design.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of San Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front of it, to the art and culture vanguard.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements come further from the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even being known by Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is extravagance artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red clothes from the top, where you can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of Verano or in fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract audiences, where he wants them to show up.
Kirill Miller is one of these purely sociophilosophers of San Petersburg, creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardism of San Petersburg of the late 1980s - early 1990s.
Moreover, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and rises up to all the state of mind.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became an organist in St. Petersburg, since he has matured to play such a difficult role because of his existence of bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going to the red city and not yellow or Turkish, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm fashion designer and dedicated myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the artists of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray stirs up aggression and aggrieved property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocation actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was shown.
I realize that was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
He made me a friend of artists of the new wave, with the latter exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and already ended the new wave.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all generations, but not for the letters.
It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of San Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, he occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical club, a bohemio club, the house of the bohemia of San Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Voice of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonograph, they wore adjustable pants, including the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an amplifier of many programs before the days of Hali-galivskeh.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of its great career; basic education and training were received from us.
"D 137" gallery, the "Club Griboyedov", are the rest of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and Asian customers are going.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the term "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so I ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not easy to work; I am a man who loves the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something recognizeable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the current and the event is clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in the Netherlands".
Payments are a temporary category.
I used to be social, but now being like this is painful and scary.
But in all countries everyone is embroiled and the tragedy is gone.
I love Grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a total and mandatory change of clothing.
Now they follow it by the clothes, heading outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person doesn't have to be given his hand or his face.
And the fraud will be eliminated when it changes its clothes.
We just saw you in the role of urban organist.
Which is better than I am to be!
- Well, can the best commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be sculpted, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the deintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouped into orders, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone's divided into microcommunitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to St. Mikhailov comes in thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones. There's the sex-social sphere.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marked.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall alongside Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from San Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a staff member of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were right everything was otherwise, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in San Petersburg who could well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate these and open their way.
Now it's promoting subjective personal taste.
The same Earth, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's up with you, San Petersburg?
San Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's land.
But on our stones it's hard to grow art.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a number of people who are curious about exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is incredible.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was in the early part of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from San Petersburg.
Light Up in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a deadly asteroid.
Spaceships with humans on board are looking for a rest planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species under conditions of intrusion or on the same planet of rest?
I think there's a few places to choose.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Marte," says researcher chief of the State Astronomic Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Marte are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of playing in space with the flower began to be addressed.
Half a century ago experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of orbital giants did not differ in any of the earth's varieties.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979 they were sent to the condornosis egg area to check how embryo development is developed under intrusion conditions.
We get a normal pollutant as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must be kept on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems Laboratory (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the cops were turning around on the ass.
And after 10 hours in recent births, a total set of instincts was given.
The pollinators didn't react to light or sound.
And the tragedy was that within four days they just died.
"And twice we got the cops born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the cops in space.
The last time a biological "minor" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, "Bion" biosatellite will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which was sent to space already with fevers.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was exactly in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be conducted," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been able to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their normal habit, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
Unlike small animals, however, man can at first.
The Wise One has the abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most accurate that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviote flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments Veteran of the airspace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Terreshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The daughter's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in the open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We're few, the astronauts are told who after long flights all have been well-educated, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," recalled Cosmonaut pilot, Soviet Union hero, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must seek new ways of biotechnology, radiological protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator of the Cosmonauts Training Centre is a mandatory step in flight preparation.
Under zero fleet conditions, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
The water symbolizes ingravitation.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is located about 9 months within its mother’s amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bathroom only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn birth monitor.
In summary, if ingravitation is a more natural state for a newborn, for women there is a need for gravity, the strength of pregnancy.
In the inravidation of the abdominal muscles and the pelvis are rapidly depleted, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, let's forget that, trusting in the action of incentives for birth.
You can, of course, give the light in a special camera, it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the organism does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
At a recent birth in orbit it is impossible to wear it with a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will allow us to bring the Earth to a disabled person who is totally incapacitated," the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
With time, however, this will be a reality when human beings in their ships are headed to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the "schvarc" system has not given guilty policy
In the case of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is costly.
This is how Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Control Supreme (NKU), says in an interview for Nowalná.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need," that describes the current situation.
Joint checks by the Czech and German inspectors also lead to similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, mention Peter Nečas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "schvarc" system.
The first minister recently said that ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb businessmen with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the operation of the office which has an obligation to carry out such controls nor require obligations," Kala noted.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control at the Congress of Deputies, Mr. Ud spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, under which legislation was compared to public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control we started a couple of years ago.
It was simply this: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by existing legislation in each country and then practice itself.
We have combined it all and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can contribute to this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
A common control of this type could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, reduction and improvement of borders, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting something at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid such wealth and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the threshold for tenders, that is, we're going to get it.
Maybe because the system is satisfied with so much "paper," that those who want to look for errors in the system can make it easier than if the limits remained as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in other ways?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there is the Bundesrechungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with a similar organization like ours, with a colleague as well, the only thing that is that in its case it is structured in such a different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
Competences are also to some extent similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the accounts courts are even at this level. In this respect, it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to set a comparison without specific data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's certainly not, but, again, I don't like making this kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it hadn't been so, I wouldn't have assumed any benefit from working with our office, wouldn't it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did your Office mean by the amendment of the law on public procurement? Is its incidence shown in some way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
For now, it is noted in the future control preparation process: we have started a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", by which we have made almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process are corrected and similar.
Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, implies an embryo for the bureaucratic system?
I believe this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will.
The problem that may arise is that the legislation "is persistent" and it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous legislation, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
So does it make sense to endure the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who wish to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this type will only be able to create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road starts.
The first minister has recently stated that ODS would not trouble businessmen with controls of the so-called schvarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the schvarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, even the first Prime Minister of the Government may prevent the Office from carrying out such controls and requiring obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we're gonna do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, legislation is quite strict as to how it should act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded from the best offer by failing to meet formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we need.
Streets offer ice plates, although most of them are transparent
In several places in the Czech Republic the streets offer ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transient, some need to be extremely cautious.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the streets in the region of Karlovy Vary were transparent, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and it will oscillates between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
He has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, the snow reaches nearly 30 cm in heights of the Metal Mountains.
In some places visibility was still poor due to the snow, according to information from the regional road control centre.
The fast R6 road and the first category road in the region are now transparent without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to be extremely cautious, especially in some bridges whose surface can be frozen and rebalancing.
Also, all roads of second and third categories, including mountain roads, are transparent.
However, in some of them there are still strands with ice and acidated snow.
More attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové Region
In some East Bohemia roads there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a snow layer on the roads, reports on its pages the Road and Bus Direction.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger posed by ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
They can be produced frozen in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially in the second and third categories.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitiv have been chemically treated.
There are snow particularly on the streets of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a snow layer located in the highest areas of roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the region of East Bohemia, the sky will be today between disintegrated and partially cloudless, without precipitation.
The temperatures will generally oscillate between three low zeros and a positive degree, providing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transparent this morning, although caution must be removed and time will need to be adapted.
In the early hours of the morning, temperatures will be around three to nine °C.
After the snow and the subsequent drop of temperatures, some roads could also be covered by ice.
In some places drivers will meet black, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is learned from information from the regional road control centre.
The D5 highway is almost non-restrictable, although it is recommended to be extremely cautious, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of Pilsen and Tachov bordering with Germany there may be ice plates.
The roads of the second and third categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of snowflakes.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less transited roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be equipped with partially desirable snow.
After chemical treatment, he was still snowed at the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský Križ.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; on the Shumper road they accumulated about three centimetres of snow, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transparent without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Shumper road, there are remaining snow.
Drivers at the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-distance snow in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the ČTK Šumper road administration confirmed today.
On the ground and at night they also visited Jesenická their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now out of reach and out.
On Olomouc's road roads are translucent without restrictions, in Šternberská drivers should drive cautiously on forest roads, where roads are still wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different routes at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
The temperatures are kept low in zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow are obviously remained in the shoe. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the south of the central Czech mace, there are no problems and roads, usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded by the lady.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to disappear and in the night the sky will be dissolved and there will be ice.
From the general streets conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by branches of trees that had been arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
Shimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to collect positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarming news that we like to catch up with.
To The Tap Tap Music Group we prefer to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to put the end of the world or to avoid it.
Moreover, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state benefit act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the previous day, 20 December at 21 p.m., we will hold 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time that the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to him?
It was my idea initially, then we were all working together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
With the end of the May calendar, we have also created a single collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and original boots against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called Himno against the end of the world, which takes the title "End of the World, Cancelled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, whenever everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be connected at the same time thanks to the special transmission directly on Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets Jesus' protagonist role in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, other than organizing many good deeds and concerts...
Let us make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in them and have fun working with us.
To what will the money spent in concerts against the end of the world be devoted?
The equipment for the education centre without barriers Studio, which we will end in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkóv ústav.
The students at the Jedličkóv school receive regular visits from teachers who perform interesting and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we do our best to make it possible.
In the framework of the finalization of the works in Jedličkóv, there will be an independent building to which we will be transferred with this project.
Each concert has several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop an attractive programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act in Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratrapere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchiy.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "speech action" in the future?
In May we will act for the first time in the Pražské annual festival, so we will certainly prepare here an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How are the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it might look at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs need to travel in the equipment compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a few years ago, everything came out without any problems.
With foreign exits you can compare the different attitudes of society to those with disabilities and other aspects.
What have you found them so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in this case, there is a lot of way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no time for a person to move alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as current as it is, for example, to give someone preference in wheelchairs in elevators, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil society has been established that seeks to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas do we need to take the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects where we're going back...
It is important, however, to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very common that people with severe disabilities move by their public account and can go to the service, the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we're going a little ahead!
A respected or uncooperative society is one thing, but when it comes to the time when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers begin to change everything.
To date, it is isolated cases of people with great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years ago, what led them to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in the Jedličkóv school, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm music, I play, among other things, the saxofon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And with time, as our moderater Ládía Angelovic says, we were a little handsy.
However, popularity has not come up to these last years, am I mistaken?
It is true that it has helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
With the help of the European Union, we can also allow us to be skilled in quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to come so far with The Tap Tap?
From the start I saw the potential there was, which could be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and it is too late to accept.
There's a few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and to develop, of course, on the condition that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, it's for the whole society.
Did it help to make you a demanding boss, how do many people describe him?
If we want to do a quality job, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they realize that they have to spend two days trying, going to the preparatory test and spending a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one: Ládía Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
Anyone who has the will and will will will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 2 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, Brno Square and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the walk through videoconferencing to sing together the song of The Tap Tap Group "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to pool the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkóv ústav de Prague, which costs up to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free access to the Bohemiaticket sales option
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as a 12th member of the ESA, the second member of the ESA of the former Eastern European block, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began its intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission for the following years.
However, Poland's way to the cosmos began a long time ago.
Polish enthusiasts have already dedicated themselves to space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left independent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnaul-Pelterie prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major proponent of astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautism, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was given to one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a dress was built in Poland that was to be provided by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal, nor is it known the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the cohete would be used for the start of the dress or for its brake.
The information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to be dedicated to missiles.
The research was funded by Komörka Techniki Armor in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powitrzna and rakeetobomba lottery", by author Lelywa-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowi Doradczo-Naukwy) was responsible for all mission techniques projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in post-war Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem refers to society for the first time with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautism.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmetic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since early 1956, the Polish Association of Astronautics (PTA) had hoped to become part of the International Federation of Astronauts (founded in 1951) and in October of that same year the PTA has become a full member.
The following year, the first president of PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronauts.
He carried out this task until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has participated significantly in the development of RM probe cohet (Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish cohet to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The cohete had an apoge of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and air tests from two stages RM-2 were started in the Blüdów desert in summer 1959.
The cohete averaged 1.4 meters and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developing cohete was the subject of real scientific study. The Cohete RM-34 was to have a 14.5 km support and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first types of RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-phase cohet with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A,-1B and -1C), which were different from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A cohete the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B is 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C is 0.62 litres.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 Cohete was developed in the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined in researching space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercommonautate after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Judge suspended the Social Labour Act.
The resolution triggered a heated debate in society.
It will then be interesting to consider the existing problem from a broader point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and regulatory competition.
As a result, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict.
The cause is at the beginning of free trade and the free and limited movement of private capital, together with the destabilised financial speculation.
The effect of major differences on labour costs (of wages) is economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut distances and thus "pronounces a low price" of the competitor with the aim of doing so with most of the market and thereby increase its margin of benefits.
To a large extent, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or well disappears. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the labour price, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social cost of the state is necessarily increasing.
All this situation promotes the total disinterest of businessmen by paying taxes and compensation for the economic and social damages they have caused in their interest to benefit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The poor practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments set aside private capital for their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly true in the changes in existing laws.
The objective is to force the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially in respect of wages.
This is done on the one hand through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the limited rights of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing the gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food supplies in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of aid is already a million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a very common case: people employed with a pay so low that the state must pay the rest to get at least necessary to survive.
A sample of this type related to the situation of the German Federal Parliament's auxiliary employees was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the EU's southern states lead to the same situation, no doubt, and the people who are pressured by an abstinence at their social level are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to live with a bad salary at society's borders, hoping that one day they will reach their private investment capital country.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never comes because Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turkish, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
The liberal theories and media state to the extent that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
The private capital defends the issue that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence itself in the political process and, of course, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly convincing.
The test is the existence of lobbyists, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual interests, in a legislation that is practically reprobable in all parts but is not criminal.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, without financial means, are responsible for drafting draft laws to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
This type of draft law is adopted later in Bundestag, the German Parliament.
In this way, all power does not give up on the people, as is announced in the Constitutions of Western Democrats, but on the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is clear that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like that described by Appianos in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to deintegrate and administrations took power."
Instead of bribes, benefits obtained illegally and help finance stones or swords.
Sodomy and corruption were spread unstoppable, and people listened to the Urinas with the voice of a previous vote"... "there were no people of a character who wished for a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consulates"... "It started to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocraticity and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Apianos thought in Pompeii, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocratic.
The conclusion, as in the past, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences for individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital cannot, in its essence, understand and claim the benefits of all society.
The result is the same as he then, a decade of unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the increase in fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the destabilization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined break, pending the next blow.
The real demolition is that the current elite completely ignores the hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as well as those we know in ancient history and most recent.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not for a long time.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of private capital monopolies in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could."
"If my children didn't want war, there wouldn't be anyone" Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife, in his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One side of Israel argues for the right to self-defence and incites the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and advocates racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. In the end and after all, the citizens of today of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live in the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the screen, a view to discover who is benefiting from the tensions that have been drawn since 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small land area in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on whom or what group of people is the main proponent of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is in the first line.
At any time we can find an Alejandro Magno or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who guided their steps autonomously or if behind their throne someone was leading their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this involves has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these very rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't know): the Rothschild.
It doesn't write much about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, would cover their backs, which always meant strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries that are not represented, have been declared or are preparing for war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack there were 5, after the defeat of Gadafi there were only four, but Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
All that you've tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild Bank, started during the Secesion War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was arrested in 1936 after he wanted to appeal to the FED because he had triggered the major economic crisis of 1929.
His defeat by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike mason, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating major monarchy states throughout Europe; the second was to eliminate colonial superiority, especially from Britain, and the third was to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a million people (a similar number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would waste and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a project for similar solutions) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the wealthiest family group operates, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, errors, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis such as the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austrian-Hungary throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The World War I ended suddenly and unexpectedly, from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitalization (wars to end with Russia's war were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demeaning of the great power of Central Europe, the East-Hungary Empire.
In order to prepare the land of World War II, banks and politicians were allowed to create, in a comprehensive manner, a conflict situation due to the massive war repairs imposed on Germany, which created the best conditions for the radicalization of the impotenced masses. Later, they were equipped with the Germans to serve the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to the perpetrators, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which had taken the call and caused the state of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that looked forward to the formation of a Jewish state, especially in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned earlier set the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War set out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler drew too much attention to what international banks had taken in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the best conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, in a similar way, the war-reparations imposed on Germany led the way towards World War II, with the declaration of Israel's state of focus for a third war.
If international banks could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first battle line, now with the Arab population or, generally, with the Middle East Muslim population.
Israel is a vast laboratory, a machine of solidarity and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also at international level. Let us take as an example how the sympathetic and detachable Israelis are secretly divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at first it was the code of some individuals and their fate by global power?
In this regard it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandate holders, because, as is happening in our country, international banks only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist policy, loyal to international banks, which does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account Iran's control of the Ormuz bond, by which 20 per cent of all global oil (the navigation corridor has only two millimetres), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serve a number of people who are part of the well-equipped financial aristocracy.
A world where each new individual is born with a chip that controls all its beings.
"And everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, must have a mark on their right hand or on their front, not being able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of its name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, who sums up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo: If it's hard, call me Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students attended the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was replaced by the devastating Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored its regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: it could not be allowed to take the Shah on board because if it did, it would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the regents in Iran, where the revolution had demilitarized in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not at its disposal.
It was a hit on the U.S. prestige, which then intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Government's negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., its fate caused a wave of solidarity and enthusiasm against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck features an episode of this story, which brought little success to America.
Just before the package was occupied, six employees from the building escaped.
After a complicated pilgrimage, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, thereby helping a story covered with an extraordinary point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the cycle of overproduction of fiction science.
Gender combination
The plan that brought the expert into "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the lie seem true, it was written on the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, and the fiction production company had even a real waste.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film was made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several generations.
On the one hand, a realistic political trigger; on the other hand, a "caper movie", the story of a episode that came out well, a fraud (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the state of mind. On one side we find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, symbolic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were plasmated in the same way in the film; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood's typical scenes are a lot lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
In addition, scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions: men carrying the situation at the negotiating table, at the desks of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to resume his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been subject to burles, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is its third longest, after "Little Adios, Adios" (2007) and the trigger "The Town. Town of Ladrons" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film where the action doesn't take place in Boston City, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehera will "run" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introduction sequence of the package is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the misunderstanding and the lack of predictation that arises when, somewhere, history makes a step forward.
Affleck and his associates have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the taxing team at the Tehran market).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it's quite well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn't all come out so elegantly (the scene that captures the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America, and the destabilized search after its track becomes a joke).
Argo bottle is the decontrol which arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very grateful role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, not less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its achievement and the retro style of a thriller that mentions the 70s.
But if you break up, that'll be hard.
As a reference to a real history and as proof of the extremes that may be the notions of the presence and popularity of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of globes, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which provides an annual survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas at the EU workshop".
"If it happened to us after the last incident, the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota of women in European senior positions," said Pravo Patrick Nacher, the director of the survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women is one of the absurdities mentioned.
To date, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they are objectively at a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher reported.
Among the EU's conflicting regulations, for example, is the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small number of dangerous substances or the directive sums up the size of gallins, which has contributed to a considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The actual prohibition has been criticised on the use of the term "mantequila de untar" or the withdrawal of the classical bomb of trade.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 cm.
The device of the Union shall often make such decisions under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including the threat of veto, requires the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that high-quality plates in the EU should have a length of at least 14 cm and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended that this only seeks to harmonise non-harmonised national standards up to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been weakened on the basis of the existing directive leading to food waste.
The applicant to gain the investigation could be the EU's requirement last year that in the inflexible worlds marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to influence them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring here to an American study which, when it comes to toys, globals are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies also to the use of infanticides by children under the age of 14.
Curious events are even born in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation on European officials: anything that has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to harm Greece's sensitivity, FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) must be spoken of.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the investigation, among the abovementioned absurd proposals, the Union requirement on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies available in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume established for seven spare parts, which posed a threat to substantial fines.
Investigators were also concerned about the possibility of paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for subsidies.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are in disfavor for not having a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in October 2004.
He argued that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of the cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development directed by Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often critical, EU regulatory efforts and, as well, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our respect, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the cost of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, as in other countries of the Union, by the struggle for the right to name their traditional products, although our country has not always won the war.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc claim, but had to change its name to the national crown, whose tradition in our country was re-examined in the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemak".
Only products produced from the sugarcane distillate may be named iron, but not those from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the feta and gorgonzoles known worldwide, the German city of Lübeck or the Parma amenon, for example, are already found in the Gallets of Karlovy Vary, the map of Pohorèlice and Třebön and, among other things, the variety of Žatec.
As EU-protected mares, they may be proud of Pardubice's yellow bread and Horíice's vessels v Podkronoseši.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm a loved one, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did it happen to you to be presented to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it was all right in our country, then I wouldn't present my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are punished, the taxes and the age of retirement are increased.
I didn't have any ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidate is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has been on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you supporting those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidate for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I realized that if I were elected senator, I would present my application to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas real.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but that we blame anyone who wants to start a change.
To this end, you are given the means of communication, which discourage and confuse freedom of expression with freedom of speech.
Of me it is said that I gave the journalists what I had been the advice of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial issues and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million is presented.
To that end, the law must be changed.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the leadership office can be recognized as an autonomous work, and we have done so.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether on the right or on the left, it is rejected for purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to implement it without any ambiguity.
Is it better to be considered a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care is that we go ahead.
I don't care if anyone's right or left, I want to join people.
I have always openly supported any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSCHM or ODS, and I will also be against bad ideas.
It makes a joke when it's said about you that you're populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, it is only limited to it.
And he can't survive long-term politics.
Or do you believe that if you address and talk to people, you will gain, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convict politicians, journalists and civil society and try to get them from me.
If he had been elected President, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television transmission in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legislate criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and public officials.
And maybe they should communicate because they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that indicates disputes, pressure can be placed on the political scene.
Let us take into account the direct election of the President, which has been a success of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just a lover, not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to find allies.
I just started in politics and tried to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out of hand myself, but if it doesn't work out well, I'll leave it in six years and return to the private sector.
Sounds like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, so they'll best be encouraged to submit their application to the Senate.
I saw Radim Jançura, but I refused because I had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who lighted out the frauds with light heating oil.
I presented myself from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in balance.
The sixty percent of the population did not attend the Urunas, and those who did so voted against the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the hopeless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
It's about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated 25 million land, a estimated 10 million floor, another eight million square floor, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and an estimated Superb Skoda in a million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
Of course, I have an Aston Martin because he was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was mad at women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
Conducts an Aston Martin, its property is valued at 60 million and does not have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to blame myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with my wallet money.
The costs of the campaign are essentially what I will receive in terms of a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't be presented as a candidate.
So you're going to continue with your business activity so you can live?
Didn't you say before I left this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I promised, I left some of my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People would like it to be the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much is it used to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I'm still winning.
If he was president, then I'd leave the business.
You can see all the interviews in the edition of the Prava Saturday.
The MVRDV architecture study shows that real adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished "mountain of Books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a future look, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a transvestance that goes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, TI technician in a large company located near the library, says: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one gets into these old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city located at the gates of Rotterdam, which deserves only a visit escape, gives the due honor of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people presents the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to general culture and copy the seven phytosanitary bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated armoured hormonal miniatures.
The success of the educational offender was limited.
And that was how the political officials decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for buildings fun at the pair of cinemas, took the subject with his usual serenity and compared the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around him and touched his shoulders, Maas proceeded to tap the books in size by forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear concierges:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the amount of EUR 30 million will rise to the planned location.
This form is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, supermarket, post office and a couple of housing and housing buildings.
In early November the bookstore was galarized with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also named after the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way, the small town of no history, which up to date had nothing more than a post-modern oil zone and an amazingly fading compound after which a white façade would be better an intuitous central lake, now with a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of its history.
The long path to the book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a castle.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain machisus, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to base it with its topography at every step of its ladder up.
The fully acrystaled interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the ground of collectd ladrill and elegant speakers support the public condition of the library in an unambiguous way.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can come to see the park's banks, dogs and children and girls playing football.
And on both sides books, books and more books.
" Normally book stalls are available along the façade and a huge dark room is opened in the center which is usually something uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put our feet up the classic space configuration and take out the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: the offices, the Internet library, the aerez club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the center.
Special mention deserves the black remains that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and walling at the same time.
The view, the touch and the olfato are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers most of the day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Job Troubost, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it's like one day, in a fresh agricultural holding, we meet with the appropriate sub-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the winters and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of narrow millimeters of thickness is used as a basis for subsidizing the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fabric lasts for two stations and then loses.
For the library this fabric was taken for the first time in such quantities up to four inches [4 cm] of thickness.
With heat and pressure, the name agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogenous and resistant material that smells a new car mix and sport jacket.
After 105 steps to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, we are looking forward to the reward: there is not only a fantastic view of the city from the coffee shop but also a beautiful Dutch croqueta and its plants planted in huge cats.
They create a pleasant environment for the pair that maintains adequate air humidity for this mountain of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"Although it is necessary to believe it in its vast acrystal surfaces, this building is an example project with regard to ecology," Troubost says.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun shines on the sun for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden circles located across the glass façade serve as shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is the thing about automatic people.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker of the Information Technologies sector, has already been attracted to putting his feet in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She has named "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "dear soul".
The reason is that, due to the opening that took place a few weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical eggs of a library that does not yet have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been worth it.
The stalls are full.
"There's nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the library.
Even though I'm just there to worship.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in that queen discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a portion of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and the cult he can be.
Finally a starting point to match your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S. relations, this is in Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant the status of a United Nations observer State to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally disappeared.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the North American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also withdrew from what was being done to establish a flight ban zone.
This has been finally declared by NATO.
Does it make it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international topics are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the reorientation of its foreign policy at this time, leaving a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are in a crucifix.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy has a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other major powers and that is why Germany should protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not alienate from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you so much importance because it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany lost its relationship with the United States by refusing to vote in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, Germany enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has been able to reap a certain amount of respect.
At the end and at the end, all of this has done but demonstrated that it is a country that is seriously taken into account as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly shown for a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of the internal policy of the United States.
I believe that the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the Government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the real diversity of opinions does not really have the disgrace that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relationship between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything enthusiastic about the policy it is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
So they do not have the possibility to form part of a superior entity, but they must influence things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future when Europe is forced to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, since it is simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a pelagic subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a protagonist role?
Or maybe he's still making it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been accustomed to it, it has always been a bit uncomfortable and, for some obvious reasons, it continues to play a more important role in the country.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is a major actor, certain anti-German feelings are removed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is increasing, but the EU does not currently cover that gap, so who is there?
The Germans will not be given more medicine than to assume a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it makes them even more popular, it's life!

"Protection of Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly converted into China Marks
Armani is a well-known brand at world level and Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This name hides a name officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this joy of protection while the real eponymous do not present a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"To foreigners it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Taylor Wessing buffet specializing in violations of protection rights in the Middle East.
Every week comes to me with a new case.
Samplers simply add a few letters to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archiver where he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well-known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. For his clients, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to obtain a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or the accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful for business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15,000 million per year in China, the third market for luxury goods is in size and is growing at a higher rate.
However, the cancellation of registrations of questionable legality in the trademark register is complicated and much money is also required.
The processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long that the name of the claim's object had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has a bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plaintiff because the process has damaged its brand in China," Pattloch says.
This is sometimes the law of the forest.
Some of the best known cases have to be seen with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a dispute against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that has been absorbed recently by the German bomber Putzmeister.
So today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the star of Mercedes.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, used at first a white and blue logo that reminded BMW of a great deal; the matter was directed to the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodril looking at the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The Pekín CTMO brand office recognizes that difficulties have been encountered in 2010 due to the lack of equipment and staff provision.
Last year, however, "the situation of labour emergency returned to normal".
In this way, the number of non-transmitted claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending for resolution.
Winning against this cost a lot of money
As usual in China, figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China will lead the list of new registrations worldwide for 10 years, as the brand office points out.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure of up to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid for rights.
In other words, this means that, on average, each registration costs 1,180 yuan or 160 euros.
To win against this costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has fought in the courts against a Chinese immitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illicit manufacture of imitation car parts,
the immitator has managed to ensure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the appellants are not protected," notes Hanno Wentzler, President and Council Member of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also estimated the resources of municipalities.
In the following two instances, he was given the reason for Freudenberg, but the opposite party is still fighting.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where the resolution is still pending.
Wentzler relied on the ability to solve the issue in favour of the matter and praised the professionality of the courts.
However, he also claims that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review shipments from up to a hundred years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite party a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement but failed.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers posed in the Middle East are even threatened by affecting Europe,
specifically if imitations are guaranteed there rights on unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had recently left this trade area, however it was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and Pattloch lawyers recommend that German companies be very cautious when dealing with China.
It is not enough to trust international law on trademark rights, but what must be done is "to also register in China everything that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg had lost the last seat of his private battle, then he would have to pay the contrary party license rights on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World Day of the Fight Against AIDS: dancing, singing, helping
Heidelberg is testing the heart of Imbunui and in Swaziland the victims of AIDS are happy
The history of a link is capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts by the dance: cowboy boots, ballast shoes, tacon shoes and mocasins are looking for the compass on the ground of the park, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin slowly to raise the voices of the singers (control, low, content and soprano), reheating, hugging and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his castles when he tries to order his energy and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Medical Psychology Institute, the Imbunui choir tries a new song.
Fifty singers have also come from 23 to 69 years of age from human geneticist to home lover.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to have approximately 34 million people infected by the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found in Germany parents for 180 orphans from the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be absorbed.
This contribution will cover the school's matrix, the uniform and will guarantee you a warm daily meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbui means "historic Narrator" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak fluently this bungalow language, but singing they know.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this soft foreign language that is sometimes able to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres straight from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni who depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple bars and pajamas, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have contracted AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see with good eyes the circulation, a practice which has been shown to reduce half the risk of infection.
More than 40 per cent of the residents of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something more than thirty years has become common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this large population, but what they saw above all was many children in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, opportunities in a poor country are more rare than they are.
At first, it was only the special commitment of a few things that made it possible for a child to be out of college and enjoy a hot meal every day. This all for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the ETS of bacterial origin are syphilis, clamidia and gonorrea.
ETS of the most common viral origin are AIDS, human papillam virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and Sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more frequent in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are clamide infections, tricomonas, human papilla virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrea.
HIV infection among the country's heterosexual adults is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, clamidia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the virus of the human papillam also adds to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to decline since 2007.
About 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is a tenth of less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a vesicular disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, flu, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or worms.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore they are not detected.
How can one protect?
Conservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer protection to hundreds per cent.
Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through sexually transmitted infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change with frequent sexual intercourse.
If they are diagnosed temporarily, most ETS can be treated and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, ultimately, not least, of the honours that cover the crown for their actions throughout Germany, they are able to earn enough money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In Zowwa Dlamini's own village a safe woman herself and with leadership powers manages the money sent from Germany.
It is important for orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as it is called for older women in Zulu, are the people's pillars.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care of the children at school every day momentarily and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 pregnant children, receives a wage from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a school of construction, has built two gallinians and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization, has achieved that many of the people have been subjected to HIV testing.
This is not obvious, because, despite the patent that is present in this disease throughout the country, it is not common to talk openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"The AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has to look at sex."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its opulent and full life-style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficial way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to countless temporary people who move from one side to the other and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept contact with skin against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbupi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa by singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; not only does recognition bring me an excellent environment and much joy, but it has also been able to start a couple of tears to someone other than a fierce border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the abandoned children.
Although this small population appears only on the maps, in the river Ezululu is well known.
"Come near Esitjeni, there shines the light," says the locals.
And after walking the 8,733 kilometres straight back to Heidelberg to the test rooms on the Bergheimer street filled with singers marking the step, one is aware that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite being from the nearest planet to the sun, there is also cold water, as it is learned from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently located in the shadow.
It seems that it has at least 30 cm and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is mainly caused by comets or, most likely, by asteroids that in their day were shot at Mercurio.
No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says researcher chief of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Fully unwarranted for Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are devoted to exploring the depths of the universe.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family picture" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars appear as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the red color of the "new born" stars.
This region of star formation, called a little romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Cassiopea, a distance of 6,500 years.
This image of an extinction star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring in the form of a donut is composed of the material the star covers in its extinction process.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located thousands of years of light in the constellation of Sagitario.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (died in three), since some dark lines of dust divide the heart of this area of star formation into three holes.
In the constellation of Ofiuc, astronomers could photograph the signs of a cosmic carbula: 400 million years of light from the Earth the nucleus of two galaxies in the process of fusion were scaled one to the other to end shocking irremediately.
This formation of stars was captured by Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the name of the Australian Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris at the Cefeo constellation.
The nebula located at 1,400 years of light is composed of particles of dust whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the particles of dust we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black eagles located at 430 million years of light from the Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the spiral galaxy of the largest size UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of most brilliant young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebulousa, there are also constantly new stars; at 5,000 years of light from the Earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo would use it one year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing, and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is up.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equivalent to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of Arecibo radiotelescope (Port Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its signals) can help anyone who has a computer, providing processing capacity.

Here comes the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also welcome the name E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Very Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Up to 2018 you can't wait to take pictures.
By 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, where they explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-metre mirror diameter.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the hand of Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolated planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1.235 candidates had been located on the planet since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the basis that there is also ice in the southern coast of Mercurio.
However, there are no compelling evidence, as the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
The radiation measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice in Mercurio for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first orbit around Mercurio, scientists now have the assurance that it is.

The passage by the Talysh mountain region could be considered wild and romantic.
The minibus makes great progress through the sinus road that passes along the forest hills, large cauldal rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
It's all green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Sea.
However, we are located in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talishi" people who don't know much, except they're perfectly dominated by the Persians and the Algerians and they're very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town assumes a architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit everything into such a mountainous landscape.
European tourists only arrive here, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To cross the 323 km that separates both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this fertile region.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what he needs to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May because of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Thais from the place that has been over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to an image in white and black.
This is my grandmother, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the invisible star of the museum is the shepherd of Şirali Müslimov sheep, who seems to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth party that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslimov's age is quite suspicious.
He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. It seems that he still had time to design a daughter at the age of 136.
So has Shirali Muslimov been wrong in his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian population.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan there are also very advanced elderly people," Scholz says, "even in Sweden there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; maximum when there is no civil record.
All day washes full of defrosted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, residents of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many older people live here in the south?
The tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Thais.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely rich food in the calories of the talyshi, which worship meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a dehydrated butter every day, be so healthy.
Or maybe the natural way of life that keeps young people alive? In Kengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age he is relatively young for what he is about to become.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wooden house throughout the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves in an enchanting way a huge bag of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, one of them children and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both became grandparents some time ago.
They also play on one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical dishes in an ambombed way.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the panel conceals two long dark rubies that her son discovers pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen down and kept your color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own garden: tomatoes, potatoes and guarantors.
I've never been buying a supermarket in my whole life.
Then tell us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar period of World War II.
However, everything returned to its collapse when the "knew father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship that is practiced in the country's parental form, which leads its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, the moment the witness gave his son Ilham.
At least the largest people in Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva covers 230 manats (about the same amount in euro) for monthly pensions, a quantity with which to live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the greatest are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to keep her alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Expressions that compete among themselves in Cairo demonstrate the terrible division in which the country is raised.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not excommunicate in patétism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially to Christian concepts, liberals, illustrated Muslims and secular ones.
All of them, who have so far been raised without remedy in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile through the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, nearly asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the duties of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral title granted by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive yourself of your power in court?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been approved by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour evening meeting, are really worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the deleter is also said to be based on "the principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean of "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It has no reason to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something - in fact, would result in the lack of training of the judiciary.
Most of the deleter of the constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a strong repression against the opposition.
After the dictator's fall up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As the miner establishes, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
This is such an unnecessary formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly sets out equality between men and women.
Instead, he prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his relatives.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it must be punished.
Equal doubt is the formulation that prohibits "infection of people"
Is it enough to charge the president or a check on a letter?
The question of interpretation, like many other things in the deleter that have been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The revolution's back"
Weeks ago the opposition was closing lines against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir Square in Cario and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we are going to finish victory," Hamdin Sabbahi says, who takes the third place on the list of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the constitutional deleter should be "in the dust of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state attack against democracy".
"When you call the referendum, we will go to your palace and we will defeat it," says oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been exposed," was quoted in the Egyptian media to political oppositioner Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
On its part, the well-organised Muslim community made a call to celebrate an anti-Muslim event; if not on Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of El Cairo.
Many women covered with a vision and members of the salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "cleanse the country" at the same time as they declared: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's party didn't want to risk anything like that.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the author and the parties to the same constitution would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the Urs which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the removal of Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he would share his ideology, but because for him human rights are inalienable.
For this reason he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments a conversation with the newspaper "Wellt am Sontag".
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three authorities of the State caused this lawyer to be re-appointed.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is canceling it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
It feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the Nile shores with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A exhibitant at Tahrir Square warned: "You're designing a monster you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: Is the world's worst fishing?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the greatest levels of life, not just Europe but the world.
Is it possible that the country's success is related to its awareness of a highly vulnerable fishing?
Take a series of extracurricular cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a mountain of soft and wet football clothes.
Put it there for a week.
Then you will be able to look at the aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exclusives.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Therakfisk is drilled in a room that is stopped in the water during, depending on the malaline you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and it gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to say it is a causative.
"They eat raw and then drink a glass of water from a truck," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomber from the city which is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", which is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a large amount of drink.
"Some people like water more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a piece of sushi that's gone a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different period, in which poverty is taking Norway and in which, before the freezing occurs, the fish was preserved during the autumn in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in full winter, when it is well fermented, it is removed and, of course, with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only a few generations ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly increasing; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full system of social services.
A current of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even makes not much more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered an important part of the past of Norway.
It's among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer bowl or a sandwich costs you 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not often appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still not willing to pronounce the name Anders Brevik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July".
To the Norwegians it is very expensive to believe that in their beloved country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there has been growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're so good," says Anna, our roommate, while she's going through rakfisk bands and that, with her long ruby and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian wellness.
"We are, as you said, intelligent people."
His English, like the majority of people in this country, is inevitable.
"We don't like to get up, we don't like hospitality."
Norway has managed its oil richness with great caution; however, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, it has turned into a special fund for future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it had not had during the years leading to the financial crisis all over the world, Norway kept the ticket close.
"As long as we can swim in winter and do sandwiches in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with a loaded development.
I'm in the snow doing it to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is no doubt something different and quite succulent to taste.
But in the night, he's going back to that naughty fish.
The hotel where I live is one of the many locals where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the beginners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that gives the most evidence of birth.
A television has directly connected with a presentation that takes pajartita and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like Eurovision's competition.
"What are your scores for the best fishing up there on the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Howard."
There's rice and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, maybe beat by the water.
Or maybe they're the smells of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While Mexico's incoming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take up his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges faced by the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel circle has been installed from the moon that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing a huge fall on the streets.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidency and take over the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been producing good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is undergoing a war against drug trafficking that has already taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has a strong commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Neito explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Expacho.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before co-ordinated with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very popular state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In the city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents assign it due to the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads can be driven by a huge improvement compared to the roads planted and filled with debris that were rehabilitated.
You can also see cards with your name at the entrance of a modern multi-port and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We believe that he is able to make a real and lasting change," said his political friend and associate Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of Mr Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country so much needs."
After an inexhaustible 81-year period in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party with regard to Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also received the qualification that the opposition makes of the new President's lack of essence.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great man of state and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
On the other hand, however, this is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahuaalcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high-speed highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburban of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also difficult and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was required to help combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women.
In a desert plot, located alongside a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than the Juárez City, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous of killing innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that I do not intend to address the problem of feminicide while I was in charge.
The most critical of them accuse their administration of having a fat look.
In a house of hormigon, typical of the ruined neighborhood, Irenea Budendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photos of her daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her husband killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like they had cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Budendía.
"There were signs that he had been hit and the mortal pain had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana observes from the walls, along with a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says she has been denied.
"The authorities of the state have treated me as if it were an old chump, an abortion, a complaint.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and goes away."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much ignorance," he says.
The presidential side that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised them priority during his mandate.
"I hope it's the same kind of president who was when he was governor," said the MP of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of the city of Nice are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, according to the prosecutors
The prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his detention
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defence wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of which Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove by Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest secret information filtering in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecutor conducted at Manning in front of the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Ashden Fein said that records of the weekly visits of unit officials received by Manning during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The questionnaire, which took place during a view conducted on the basis of the request for defence that the case be dismissed because its detention had been severe and that it had already been subjected to sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was detained.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the spring view, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms that officials had completed after their visits to Manning during their arrest in the military prison in Quantico, where I was imprisoned in a maximum prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When he asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to the cellphones as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials directly asked Manning about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had discussed those problems and had indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not leave any room for those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having spoken of problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel of Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he had received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council to consider the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form a month earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was found.
The military said they had been subjected to this restrictive regime, which was under surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and security of other persons.
"I want the older state to know that I was good and (I) wanted to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning witnessed Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where I was detained almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the sea base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost his knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that he would not be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening to him in the outside world was very sad.
"My world was so reduced to the Arafjon Camp, to this jungle," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a pickup, a mant, some candy, some clothes and his gloves.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was not allowed to sleep or even collapsed during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out looking at his eyes while he was asleep.
He said if the celebrants couldn't see his face when he returned in the night, they would wake him up so he could come back.
Manning's lawyer submitted a formal complaint in January 2011 on Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he had made in the Thursday statement, which, after having been forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stay out of his foot in front of the cellphones and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the mandrakes during the account.
During the trial of the judge on Friday, Manning said he gave up on the order he had given to the cellist who should let down the blanket with which he could have been covered, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning testified to the Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he might have used the elasticity of his inner garment or his boots to herself but that he had not done so.
Manning testified that that night they had taken off their cell from their inner clothes, their shoes and their gloves.
Their lawyers hope that the judge will take into account at least the experiences he has experienced during his detention and will greatly reduce his sentence if he has been sentenced to war council, which is expected to begin at the beginning of the coming year.
The defence stated that it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other allegations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to be reopened this weekend and it is expected that the prosecutors argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has held that Manning was detained in accordance with the application rules to any detained person who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully promoting the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information on national defence and theft of property or public records.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be faced with a permanent chain.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to criticize those who were; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarret comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just been down by the explosion and arrived at the immigration treatment area and was already completely confused.
Some maps indicated the road to two hills: one for "Mexicoans" and one for "Externals".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexicoan" all my life.
This is ethnic tacitism, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "irlandese" or my New York friends as "italians".
Later I decided by "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandmother's homeland, tachygraphia or guidedons were not necessary.
It was just the United States.
I speak Spanish. It's good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my passport to the United States and put me in the foreign college.
I thought at that time of this week when the elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always as the leaders of these two countries met, I saw: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also seeking to talk about growth in the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican is staying in Mexico as an opportunity to go to the United States at the moment.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and is full of regrets.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, when a U.S. official says anything that brings the most critical thing to Mexico, he starts to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are exercising the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma are at war.
And yet, to Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that of more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking back?
There's plenty.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genetic tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, where the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and he had to go north.
And most of the time, that person fell into a specific profile: dark skin, low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, although maybe we're living now the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we're living in is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the leading class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
We are seen as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not quite Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
As you can see, our existence is a phenomenon of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this chain of silk, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexicans in the United States because the first people know who they are and the second they're worried about.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You have the best of each country, but you're not attracted to any of them.
In Mexico he sees us as Americans.
And we are considered Mexicans in the United States.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've been buried during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans the amazing thing that it is to visit that country and we would force the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much regret.
And, with the inequality of wages, global corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, guys.
You're right.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still sensitive to the way their families were treated much less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Battles, New East Medium
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a little likely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood loss that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Among the useless and usual discussions about whom he first started, mountains of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it all behind their tastes or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional aboriginal.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their fatal situation could be eliminated.
A war that doesn't lose or wins
At first glance, optimism is currently very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November was kept high, this week's fronts have strengthened both bands.
Hamas' leaders, the Islamic movement that has dominated Gaza since 2007, will claim that Israel has been forced to withdraw, although Gaza has received a good palace.
And even though some of its leaders have been killed and oppressed by the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and inhabited regions of the planet, Israel has not been able to end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in Cis Jordania, the other part of Palestine currently dominated by its impeccable Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian façade.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could come to the conclusion that time is playing for their own good.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a reborn regional power which had previously been the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has discussed the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf.
The overwhelming members of Hamas say that the average Islamic moon is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where he dominates the Hizbula militia party, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could defeat Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
In particular in the southern part of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most popular and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay defeat he ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' first brothers and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which neither Israel nor the United States can be excluded.
In the meantime, Israel's long tail will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have placed Hamas on their site.
The Israeli Anti-Miss System Capula of Iron has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep quieter for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part because of the barrier that runs through the Jordan, the main part of an aspiratory territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that under international law they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of a more durable line led by Avigidor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why should I blame those Palestinian returnees for giving them their own state?
If they were really going to rule in Cis Jordan, wouldn't cohets be fired like that and how did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they lift their head.
It may push the tough needle, although the Arabic spring may change its calculations.
While Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, its priority will be to address internal difficulties.
The defence budget for Israel is more than one of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the high fire is a good start and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about it for a long time.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive Palestinians of their right to self-determination is to create a powder that one day will exploit in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography improves the situation as the Arab population increases.
Cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic penalty every time.
Both gangs need a force of people who are in conflict.
The solution continues to be that people who are sensitive to both bands, most of the world's outside and this magazine: two states and the territorial termination by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the high fire gives a little more impetus to the innocent people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to freeze the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land-changes and shared Jerusalem.
The Arab leaders should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would further contribute to the creation of a Palestinian State than the imminent attempt to achieve a virtual status in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first mandate he forgot to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems like a recent dedication to you.
This attitude implies a bleak vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.

The General Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on cathetillas of a green closed color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and the colors of the brands by an envelope of an olive green cover, a shocking images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies we sicken because they are children of smoking parents.
Apart from the different health images and warnings, the only difference between cetillas, mandatory from Saturday is the names of the brands, all printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest system of the world applied to the tobacco package.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the strains that make this habit glamour.
Trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99 per cent of the possibility that he will never.
"It can be seen that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls were related to the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has had a huge pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious adverse consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will bring to sell in Australia's streets.
Others say that their business has benefited from the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for pillars and silicon covers to capture the unpleasant images of castles had been fired almost two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Australian Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to major establishments and was expecting more.
"For us it's a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is headed.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sports sponsorship and which force most sellers to avoid viewing cigarettes, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you're selling tobacco and so much you're left with this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in signs on brands from "foot citizens" published on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked whether it is only a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and it has been difficult to make a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that industry focuses more on the new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for the rejection of new rules by Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic; these countries are claiming to be the World Trade Organization which is unjustizing trade, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO will adopt a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held discussions with other countries considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in castillas.
Currently they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India it is considering applying laws that are more difficult.
In Australia many smokers appear to be challenging.
"The photos don't affect me.
I just don't care."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Truly, there is only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the Stanco King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform cathetillas make it more difficult for him to place them in the stalls.
"It was normally one hour late to launch a delivery; now four late," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, well, it's done and we closed the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to be a little bored
During the events of the Day of Action this year, I suddenly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
To spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting us from duty-free shops.
But there are increasingly more academic and child development experts who praise the goodness of nutrition.
According to them, it is well that, both us and our children, we get bored once and for all.
Absorbing your brain requires you to look for interesting options and may only promote creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of frustration.
So should we accept with a good heart the boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I thought that now that we have more time for 8:00, obesity would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
However, as Peter Toohey says, the cathedral of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Level History" ("The Absorption, a History Encouraged") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are Latin graffiti on the exploration that dates back to the first century B.C.E.
We must also consider how we define obesity.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After considering the research published and putting the idea before a panel of discussions formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined frustration as the experience of "wanting but unable to participate in a full-fledged activity".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does nothing but wants to do it.
She points out there's no desire to do something with the patia.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the change in the attention process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense of slowness in time".
Abstaining can smell awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are depressed tend to view the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while those who are depressed think that the problem is theirs.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to focus on.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Board in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape by a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the main room to a television program on every volume that didn't keep any relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was only understandable, while the third group didn't listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more frustration than the other two groups; it was hard to concentrate on them, but they were not sure why and gave it to the federation.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, change of attention can lead to frustration," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscientificity at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or making garages, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of frustration, can actually help fight it, since they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's going to be boring at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
In order to help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "problem-of-absorption trend."
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "there are so many things I care I don't have time to do everything".
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that researchers have discovered that using these scales, boys tend to be more frequent than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
In general, however, adolescents are a type of group that is quite easy to absorb.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human Development and Community at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said they would get drunk while they were at school or doing their homework, while 23 percent said they would get drunk when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would burn.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current consumption rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adult is a period in which obesity reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, coming back to my question of principle: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not because, leading to extremes, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as putting up or falling in the consumption of substances as a means of combating them, as well as showing research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Abstaining is the way it has the brain to say you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best.
If you're tired and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see TV, you may be satisfied in a short time, but not in a long time.
"So, if your son is bored and gives you an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to enjoy himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to doping applies to other situations," she says.
Your child not only learns to take care of himself but also learns to control better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable apart from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more frustration, but frustration is a very sad and worrying wish as to relate it to something that deserves punishment," he says.
It points out that what people really are looking for is a way to get out of touch and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorodo: no instructions for the new Marihuana Consumer Act
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballist in south-eastern Colorado, faces a criminal process that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke.
Orozco says one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the suburbs near the border of Kansas, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and eventually Orozco received a legal quote for possession of drugs and related articles (less than $100 per person) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And am I?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote taken in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of cases less than the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes of marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to carry charges against the 21-year-olds on small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the next few weeks.
But the most conservative district tax in Colorado has committed itself to continuing with the cases opened by marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent shops of marijuana, recently authorised, from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also returning to the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences; all of this before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in relation to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year to be born between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide an "appropriate access" to the authorised marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres from schools, parks, child playgrounds or children's centres.
"In no way will it be more difficult to place an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for Legal cannabis, a research group recently created.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora sent an e-mail to his police officers, informing them that the city's tax would cease to bring judicial action for minors in possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to bring charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The chief of police Oates said they would be responsible for implementing the law of the city that regulates marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and sellers.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district tax, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he ensured that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, particularly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At present, 119 people face loads of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other loads.
"Our office has the obligation to intervene in judicial action against those deficiencies that were committed at the time of the crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Massa, where voters have rejected the initiative on legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer refer to adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, prosecutor of the county district, supported this decision, but also decided not to underestimate any of the cases pending by possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting time continuing to comply with the law until this change takes place," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictive reactions from all over the state show a marked ambivalentity among officials with regard to the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district taxes," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the suspects in possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"It's been so long before the courts that they can't actually accept it as legal," he said.
By being the first states to consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national drug law trial cases.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will continue.
Despite the fact that some outstanding arrests have been made by patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed in most cases that there are marijuana sales business with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although anti-drug agents are probably not taking doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, reactions will likely be shown to allow the operation of markets regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy exciser of Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can be opened.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and probably approved it next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation where we allow someone and then we have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the association.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what the community voted against in favour of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "They got me up to Oxford for being a Tory."
Universityers are not attacked for their views only now
I don't remember any moment in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of taking my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to run the course of History, I had already done the mallets, which set off my first life scandal.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were upset.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had left because it did not tolerate some university colleagues having sexual relations in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in undiscovered bags.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, today, because he had been subjected to an austerity and intimidation system.
Not because of my extraordinary name, not because it came from a private school.
I was struck by a single reason, which in the corner of the supposed illustration resulted in something shocking and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was an outstanding adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that comes now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the Conservative Party is such that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (Greece Students Group) of the Corpus Christi College say they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as thankless persons" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on students' policy and presented to the Tories as excentriques and neonazies.
She showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a plated dress and a bag with silver swab.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "turkey heads" by introducing higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Nottingham University, stated in a Dominal Journal that "there is a growing trend of leftovers in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "inconsolable", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards those who are at the right centre has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of the members," he says.
During my first week in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, was a very scared 18-year-old.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
Last year, the university had voted to reject Margaret Thatcher, an ancient student, a "honoris cause" title after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have made any Stalinist terrified.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when new students were known and familiar with the cathedrals, I received a sample of what I expected.
I discovered that the cathedrals not only had a heavy view of the mofa that was made of conservative universities but had a good interest in it.
The mine strike policy, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the seminar's wooden rooms.
The first person I attended was to translate into French texts in the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said cathedral Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
You don't have one.
Pitt, a man with a face that looked like a bike mass, knew well how to dump bad cars.
"Is it that the witchists refuse to learn French or are they, simply, are deaf?" he asked.
The other colleges laughed.
The tears that I was trying to contain touched my eyes.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, always and when I'm not too busy knowing people," Pitt lamented.
I came back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I felt alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a light pale on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who was present as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it's going.
They're dealing with anyone who's suspicious of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many Touries have recently come to appear to be workers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried deliberately to dissimulate.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist hero.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned into a dirty bitch.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"They give each other a hand, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been meant before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I take a normal life in Oxford someday?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought I was just after dinner?
Would you like to make me a worker and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open cathedral Tory was Norman Stone, professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him not only because he was the Conservative party, but also thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place why he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his attachment to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he said.
I began to move from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political points were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved teaching waters.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to smile.
I'd have broken my heart if you had left it."
Exhausted by many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar in which another cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted that my parents had "brained my brain" and called them "stupid old".
The truce took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my college career in Oxford.
That's why my father wrote two weeks' columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in fear and, five minutes ago, my persecutors disappeared.
When it was done, I took the first train to London.
I'll never come back.
Maybe you're calling me weak.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 first ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, it is hidden after a reputation that deserves nothing of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
Due to the "Valentino: Master of Costura", which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apothecary that gathers more than 130 high costumes created by its "maison" over the last 50 years.
"Love this palace," he says with his inconceivable Italian accent.
This sample is the column of a story whose only protagonist is "the Mr. Garavani" but which could not have been written without its different clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination by the energised and distant world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3rd, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite aristocratic, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of its social rise: from the humble Voghera city in northern Italy to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't close the hills of their pits on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed being invited to your chalet in Gstad," explains the exhibition "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a show in Piazza di Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner on its floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week in Paris in 1995.
"Never passes fashion because their designs are works of art," ends.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-suited love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Gallery of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre pass that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must stand by the pass to observe a "audience" of a teaching that shines the works of Valentino's teachers, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dresser who used Monica Vitti in "The Night", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
There are names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thorn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantston, a shirt, a "gillette" chalet and a jacket of the October- winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his feminity, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Ferria.
I love the colors that they use, they have great light and they're "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giodompaola d'Arenbergtampco can forget the first time he saw a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I dreamed of coming to have the age and the opportunity to use one of its night clothes...
The time finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
Buy my first dress from Valentino for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red suit, with no flights, "corsage" dragged and heard a word of honor.
"It was a real dream," says Rodrigo's wife, Arenberg.
"Valentino is independent of fashion, its obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her wedding dress with "the best care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries."
The "rey" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" were needed (as the modisto calls its costumes) to develop that sail-coloured sailor suit with pearl screws, twelve different types of belt and a four- and-a-half-foot neck.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the maximum authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a wave of the high design of the late 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Obnoble for years with the "sacrifice" of the elite, now Valentino is your best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of the highest rank in Italy), Cavalierre del Worko, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani collects as much honor as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his soft and perfect look," D'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago in a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the Jacqueline Concentration Table of Ribes, a big friend of mine.
"It was impossible. It's not time for him."
If a princess says that...
The most difficult office in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian Volcanians are judged to be alive and healthy carrying 70 kilograms of oil through sealed stone chains
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another one who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting oil from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, it must descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emits from the Earth's intestines is solidified when it comes into contact with the air.
After starting large oil rocks, which reach up to about 70 pounds [70 kg], the cages are loaded on two drums of bamboo that load over their homs through rocks sent from stone.
They are only 250 metres up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the wearers' expenses take more than 40 minutes to climb to the path of torture, keeping the balance and measuring with tens of steps to avoid falling and falling by the principle.
They know that any delay could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who died years ago for the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners get 5 cents of euro per kilo of oil they extract
Once up, a passage is opened between tourists who photographed them as if they were circular coins and, heavily carrying heavy canvasses, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a bit lower, up to 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrinbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, to its employees, which pays 662 Indonesian rubies (5 cents of euro) per kilo of oil.
It then sells it by 10,000 rubies (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalised in everyday life and is used to produce cereals, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar white.
"It's normal to charge 70 kilograms, we take out some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who often performs three daily ports.
It takes three hours for each one to complete the building, but they allow it to join 138 000 rupees (EUR 11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a poverty for such inhuman effort, it's the triple of what I would win in the field.
"The mineral newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the monthly average wage is of two million rupees (167 euros)," he explained, who previously worked as an Albanian on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the Volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as boring as the oil: "I married a young man from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him to Java to become Islam".
Then it has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it sighs constantly and its eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Then he takes three playing the ball in the Kawah Ijen, whose oil has already begun to pass billing despite covering his face with a special mask and gloves.
It has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that emits the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this kind young, intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a roommate or a receptionist from a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mula.
By sharing an unclean wooden head with other carriers, it rises every day to the two of the murky because the oil does not stop eating at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Then down to the crater, gravitating himself with a small tinnitary attached to his pocket, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the oil trails on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its fines, the mining company has not mechanismed the extraction of oil to save costs or provide no equipment to the carriers, who work for their account and both the weight.
In fact, it is not even part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) of a camera that, together with the 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this natural park cover tourists who take pictures of the volcano and its human walls.
"This work is for animals and not for people," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old supplier who spent three decades in Kawah Ijen, since he left college.
You can get up to 110 pounds, make sure you'll work "all you can" because you need the money to educate your three children, between 18 and 10 years of age.
I won't be jealous, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the oxygen burns the throat and blinds the eyes when the wind changes improvise and catches the minerals in the heavy columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one claims to suffer serious diseases... beyond that, of its usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, which have been damaged by the weight of the roads.
Balancing the canast on its back, Unainik can now only load 50 kilos at its 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of olive oil on the volcano, which three trucks move to the warehouse of Tamanzari, 18 kilometers away from a road between the disease.
"I'm not going to party, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening up his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of her five children, the older one, aged 30, also works as a load of oxygen.
Time is passing, but poverty is ever generation after generation one of the most difficult offices in the world: what the human mice do in Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, we fulfill our civil duty and we believe in life!
It may seem inverse that these verses are part of a propaganda of lies, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a balloon (boll) in the horn" to rest from Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers hope that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said I wanted to use the power of music to make people perform "their national duty".
This is a purely internet thing, so we had to make it fun and grateful.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst people in the world to play for ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative thing to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1,2 children
What is not taken so easily is the government of Singapore.
It costs US$1,300 per year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city of rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social control.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently up to 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was above 2 known as a deposit rate was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Head of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in loneliness and to the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, a policy of immigration aims to dramatically increase immigration in order to address the population's decline has created a feeling among the local population.
In Singapore there are web sites where xenophobia is rampant only against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who criticize low wages and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and savings for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has an impact on the economic growth of a nation, fiscal income, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has managed to control the number of small apartments known as "spats box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square metres and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of isolation and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says their "spat boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units spend days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
It acknowledges, however, that the new standards give clearer guidance to the developers, who were previously given work to them if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city of state.
While these new rules may be a step towards the increase in the national birth rate, talking to singles working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are face-to-face and it is also education, so many people are poking it out," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to count on my own money and time," says another young man in his early 20s.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, because the government is trying to force its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of privacy or "the area of private life which has the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your everyday life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers posed by surfing online situations that would certainly not share online?
the Periódico interviewed five people between the ages of ten and 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very important to me", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"More deep secrets would not go up to a post," says Jorge, 10 years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mother can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB, you get beautiful pictures or games.
I'm also interested in my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or someone who's making the joke," she says.
The child admits that it is wrong to publish obscenaries, from naked persons, of crimes or to write degrading or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just raising them," she adds.
"Social networks are maintained, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
There is no doubt in my answer that I would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't do anything to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this recent admission does not know 20 of the people who are listed as friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been invited or asked for the address of his house or phone number.
"If they press me or just ask me to take my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
To the young man there are no experiences of what is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was exorcising him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I don't know who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, didn't close the account.
"I only gave him privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would take pictures of acquaintances in awkward or pregnant situations.
If I did, if I got hurt or if I wanted to.
"Even I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English and licensed teacher in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, master of Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the Digital Native and Immigrants work, has collected these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are these, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still learning," he says.
He notes that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to distribute, publish or say to an age that mature does not give it to that."
"They must also be selective when what matters most is popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them it doesn't matter," he adds.
Next, Porras listed some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Oh, would you like them to publish a photo of you like you published by a friend?
You know what others publish about you?
When you take photos of the parties, did you ask other people to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every time?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as should be on social networks," he says.
Watch
The University of Guardiania, primary teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that family parents take into account social networks policies.
When you understand each of them, they have solid grounds for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardian, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "not talking to strangers".
Finalization of the Unasur Summit without publicizing the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven Assistant Envoys.
Effe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency have indicated at an early stage that it would be delivered after the closure, but then they have stated that it will be published on the Peruvian Government web site at some time.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief press statement.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day alone, the soundless video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information it circulated among the reporters was provided by press reporters from some of the Governments of the Unasur who attended the event, although not Peruvian.
The only document published during the day was the list of attending chairpersons, which resulted in hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidium of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was about the proclamation of Humala, not of the official document that closed the summit.
In late October, Peru was hosted by the Third American Summit of the Arab South (ASPA), and on that occasion, although it was strictly required by the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration previously announced.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international quotes, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists had access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Hague Court which states a different border between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala and Chile, Sebastian Piñara, met during the regional appointment and ratified that they would respect the decision of the ICJ, which began Monday in La Haya to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will strike and execute the judgment that defines the differences we are today leading to this international court," said Humala, along with her Chilean couple.
"Qile has been, and will continue to be a respected country of international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñara added, and welcomed Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they will be subjected to the ICJ took place after Colombia declared this week the Bogotá Covenant that had agreed to submit to the cases of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which he considered gravely wrong.
The summit was attended by the lack of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011, after the resignation of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the date.
The host president, Olanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after Lima's media.
The mandater read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and established the lines of action for 31 projects among South American countries by a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, it stated that the countries of UNASUR will make "an important step towards the goal of a South American citizen for what we are expanding the housing agreements".
It reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all South America banks, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and effectively".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triunfalist matrix but must serve to broaden our productive matrix and bring a better future for our people," Humala added.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas, by joining our countries and by creating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a read-only message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and they are located on the transverse axis of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as its reintegration into the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations between its neighbours was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombia's President, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional appointment that he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the marine difference after a failure of the ICJ, which was raised by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is likely to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these roads, they are not exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope we can tell him that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would be in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the defence ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
But he has the presidency for a time from the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizen": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizen is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, should learn from Europe".
Korea, who participated in the 7th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the state TV State but said that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now are practically a homeland".
In that regard, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which encouraged the member countries of the Union.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is already happening with the Andean Community's members, but there are still reactive sectors that want us back in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadoran President also demonstrated his support for the re-composition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to undermine the influence of the Anglo-Saxial States and take into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give a chair never make a commitment to anything, and instead we the Americans sign it all.
"It is impossible to understand that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said Julian Assange in his austerity to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Korea has ensured that it is not repentant of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at his time, "there were fundamental suspicions that Assange was extradite to a third country and did not respect its process".
He also criticised Swedish justice for requiring him to submit himself in his territory to the interrogation for a alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation itself allows him to conduct him through videoconferencing, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa said there is the risk of deteriorating Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador told me I had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadoran commander.
What is there is is the danger of damaging your physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It's complicated the health of any person," he added.
Korea pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadoran embassy in London, by granting a rescue route that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London for a solution at the end of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange lawyer Baltazar Garzón is making a series of procedures in different European courts," he said.
And he thought, "If Great Britain is tomorrow, this rescuer is over."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly permits it and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or asks him about Skype himself tomorrow this problem is over.
Corre took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that what is not tolerated is "mediocrity, evil faith and lie, which undermine freedom of expression".
"We are not the greatest enemies of freedom of press, we are not the bad and perverse politicians but the bad journalists in terms of profit, song and exorcism," he said.
In that regard, it was welcomed that these journalists were no longer "bankers or hegemonic countries and bourgeois people who dominate Ecuador", and he went on to say that being re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Korea also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, by arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and violence covered by law" because it "has actually destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
The Ecuadoran President also considered it "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between both countries after the failure of the International Court of Justice of La Haya, which benefited from the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That's not happening right now.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be widely processed to overcome them and continue to progress.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute by maritime boundaries that remained in the same court in Peru and Chile and felt that "it was right for Latin America to seek international courts if the two countries were committed to agree to a serious failure".
Referring to the possibility presented as a candidate at the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if she loses the February 2013 commissions, she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Korea also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that he was traveling to a treatment that was planned, routinely, which was expected to take the campaign back to Cuba.
"It does not mean a decline in President Chavez's health status," he commented.
The head of Ecuadoran State participated in Lima today at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations (UNasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths by AIDS today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a test result: positive AIDS.
"It was like a bomb hit me," refers to remembering the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "more milder", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it in his family.
He decided to take charge of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic refused to leave him "because he was wearing a cut".
Then, having AIDS was a symptom of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused harm, "attacked" its immunological system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At least 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in an appropriate way and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG HIV Unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was acquired in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a fatal judgment, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present when they start their diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a content of 200 CD4 and 50 years when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that those who receive the positive diagnosis of HIV at 25 years of age, under these terms "while maintaining control can live without problems up to 75 years", the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have fallen from the presence of AIDS.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, so it's happened to us at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a drug deficiency the problem is that patients are getting very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "N Nine out of every ten patients come when they present any opportunistic infection that needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to do more early diagnosis and therefore have to offer massive detection evidence to all those who require it."
In its proposal experts and officials of the State City Prevention Council in Jalisco (Cosideda), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who agreed to do the test at a particular laboratory, were motivated only by a friend who had done it and, despite his short age, was already in a AIDS phase and even sarcoma disease in Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better go back three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take drugs.
At the time, his parents only knew he was suffering from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his witness to those who today, within the framework of the World Day of the City, are afraid.
That they are tested, if they were at risk, that they know, among other things, if they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have diagnosis, that they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.
This, its message, summarizes the battle theme for AIDS this 2012.
Condones after the display
Large are the eggs that are among the health programmes and the common citizen, supported by Ricardo Salazar, an infected journalist who has taken the blame for HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the department of condonations has actually increased, before we were given one or two, now give us hundreds packages, and that's very good but it turns out that some people today still don't have access to a condon," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" it is a common question, with tears and judgements of value for social workers, school guides, medical personnel and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communiqué assured.
I propose to redirect this ineffective distribution; that condonations are not only after the indicators and those hundreds are located in public bathrooms in places where young people frequent.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the bills and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, by asking him if there would be any spare parts in his administration.
"That's not sex, it's best to approach the convictions of those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is the 4th national place in new cases of AIDS and 13th of HIV.
92% of the infections are sexual, 6% are blood and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can be living with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court, a judgment that does not know the structure of the Vitro Group’s debt restructuring by means of a market competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a negative precedent for any national company with savings in the neighbouring country having solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the support to the sentence issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas leaves no defence to the Mexican firms against the possibility of putting their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
The Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, stated that the main procedure was the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would involve the lack of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, to that end the United Nations Model Law on International Merchandise Law was established, and the American Law Institute was ad litemer.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote inter-competitives, recognised in the critical mass of the marketing competition, the debts held by the subsidiaries of Vitro with their mother would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-competitive debt was assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competition.
It is also true that by remaining the votes of the branches, by all means the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited will not have achieved much.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date shall be omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blame was given to Vitro of the difficult situation he faced since 2008 in the aftermath of the serious economic crisis he faced in the United States, arresting him in the country.
In the meantime, the signature of the family of González Sada will provide a reconnaissance appeal before the Court of Appeal for the vote to be completed, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
In the absence of this progress, it will be claimed that the Certoire ' s resources require that the process be reviewed by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The gravity of the case is that the court referred to a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the form of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), which detailed the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that it was withdrawn from the agreements signed by both countries to bring it under Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for creditors and creditors.
The flag of two bands: catch Vitro and catch him in the country.
Generalbalance
Sleeping for several months the complaints filed at the table by the Mexican Aircraft Unions against the company's ex-issuer, Gaston Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottle box.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking Commission and Valores against those accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank IXE F/589, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million weights.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of services by the Hotel Professional Administrator.

Seek to Dragon Mart
Meeting at the end of the week at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society generally approved the creation of a broad front to resist the inauguralization of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a cholera center of sale and distribution of face to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a living area on foot for employees of 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra had managed to unify the rulers of the south-east area to oppose the monumental thing that had taken place in some protected areas and planted the mother of all the darkness against the industry.
ACTA was killed
The Government supported a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known as the ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed on to the file.
As you know, the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disabled the possibility of considering it as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The prize has been my life."
Trotamundos of the Balontic Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years old linked to the baseball sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local balance sheet as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a brain drain would limit him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, he was a player of minor categories, a player of the National Upper Balloon, a master and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Baloncesto Federation.
"He gave me a lot of nightmares in my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during his first visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The prize has been my life."
Reyes doesn't go too far by doing that.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilities that denoting his broad trajectory, thus testify to it.
Bayammon in the Heart
Of all, those who are more excited are those who remember their step by the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old acting as co-authorised or possessive of franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Vaccero champions since 1967, who had already been a master, co-author or director.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I left with one in 1981, the year of the start of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
From there forward was "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a strong 6"7 player."
Do you want it?"
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to francutor Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shots.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given him a champion to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but it was already far away, since by 1988 it was already a federal commander.
For that time, I would like to enjoy their executives and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the 1989 Preliminary in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World, where we came to the fourth place and should have been bronzed not to be by that Canadian arbiter who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this World Group of 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just as the Dream Team won in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to what we gained the bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Tonito" Colón and James Carter young brothers, Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s because of an injury in the wheelchair.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but he gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Preliminary in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the river of the Pan American Sea of Plata, we won gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Picculin Ortiz.
Its international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count your trajectory on the different links he played.
Who was the best bourgeois leader?
That's very difficult.
We have a very good bed that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young person, I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you think is your greatest success in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s the NSNA had up to 17 teams at a time.
What's left of you?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce boys will only play in their area and only face teams from other islands in national playoffs.
Even now children travel and play too much unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of the Compulsory and Course Certificates for directors, desk officers and arbiters.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, see videos of my time music on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes when I go to gambling games.
And of course, to enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Kills actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in the "Dallas" television series, where he engaged a man with no scruples, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil giant depredator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the accident in the 1980s, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communication provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved Dallas city, representing again the iconic role he enjoyed most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday on Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
He was happy with everything he knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, grateful, loving and talented, and I'll be very surprised.
"He was an original person and he lived at the most," said Gray in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver surgeons in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking too much for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a bad tumor in the liver and was subjected to transplantation.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he leads her to live with him at his home.
He was also a protagonist of two comedians who had little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included well-received papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colours".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the most hateful J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risking homes.
It also helped him to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million TV users tuned it and turned it into "Dallas" into the second most visible history entertainment program, following the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with rape unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corruption with a charismatic smile: a corrupt businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), into being.
"I know what I want in J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here comes the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman of Friday as someone "great, inside and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already completed the recording of five chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was no immediate statement by Warner or TNT on how to handle the Hagman loss series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starved classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was married in 1931 to a lawyer named Ben Hagman.
He proved successful in the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While I was there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Suchs about My Life".
"It didn't put anything there I thought it was going to hurt someone or affect them in some way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a donor of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the fearful patients.
"I give them advice, I value them, I meet them when they come to their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but it'll be okay."
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This season, when professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was counting on an irresistible angel: The end of the "long regressive account" of the Mayo Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been arrested as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next few months: the Huracan cataclysm Sandy, a fiscal principle that some have called "deummarmedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theories of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I don't realize that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been," said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this season, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is attending the course "The Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"Let's analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could set up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they were compared with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
In the main campus of the state University of Pennsylvania, professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art and Anthropology History, have made a team to start a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to start the course again, if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "minor destruction", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final review will be taken on the basis of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night when the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It sat in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the seminar, from people asking if there was any room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me curious to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or absence of itself.
Will Weekesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and nurse student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class I could teach that," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of 21 December.
"Our first project has dealt with the Maya prophecy and we've somehow mistrusted it," said Julie Zeglen, a last year student in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The monkeys never predicted the end of the world; it's just such a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is a apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which goes back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course about "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, pointing out an exception to a superior authority.
We have a Pope's confession.
Restall noted that over the years there have been many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next day" or to think that 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years in which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the day off.
Several said they were thinking about going to parties "from the end of the world".
"Perhaps I'll call some friends to take us together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
