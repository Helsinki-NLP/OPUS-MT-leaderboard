The customs duty was reduced to a minimum at the end of the trade
The pharachia has repaired its losses after the morning morning drying.
The transactions carried out by the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) have been considered close to the normal day-to-day trade.
From the start of the dual trade, the pharaoh immediately continued on a weekly holiday when it took almost six percent.
This time, the Wall Street's shares are in progress after the reduction.
We also welcome the reaction of the market to the outcome of the US House of Representatives, which has reaffirmed its support for the financial sector's Stabilisation Plan.
Shareholdings in Asia
In Asia, parts of the plays were played by lovers, even though the showers had lost part of their losses in the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hong Kong Hang Seng Tötzsdendex recorded almost four percent during the trading process, but later lost part of the losses and reduced the decrease by about 2.5 percent.
In Hong Kong, Hong Kong, the Chinese share of Hong Kong has reached 3.8 percent of Hong Kong Enterprises Index, and the markets have been closed in Shanghai.
There were more than five percent loss in Sydney's sydney tankers, but the losses were finally reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to the Italian index, the Taiwanese population was 3.6 percent.
"The timing of American rescue is irreconcilable and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its own monetary policy, i.e. regardless of the central bank of China.
In Hong Kong, disasters are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial system's support proposal.
In particular, it is a threat that other countries will experience the consequences.
Blood clotting of the United States
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan for financial support, which would cost $700 billion (at least 12 billion).
The legislators have therefore turned their attention to the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, it will solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The U.S. has survived a blood transfusion every week and the leading components indexes have been registered for 20 years.
The Dow Jones was almost seven hundred years old, the last of which was a similar event in 1987.
The index has already happened before the vote, but when it was found that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to be released.
Congress returns: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The U.S. President George W. Bush's Government, the top leader of the United States Congress and President-in-Office of the United States of America, have agreed in the form of the agreement and in the financial assistance provided to the American financial system.
They're voting on this at the beginning of next week.
The United States legislators understood the breach in the negotiations for approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (about EUR 12 billion).
But I haven't won yet.
The Congress should complete some of the terms of the agreement before the final form and votes of the law can be made public.
The financial system's support plan shall be discussed at the Office of the Ombudsman on Monday.
He informed the Bureau of Reuters about this on Friday, Mr Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of the Financial Services.
According to senate sources, they can vote at the latest on Sundays than the plan.
According to the authorities, it should be reported that the rescue plan is being approved, which is the first important factor in attracting money markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, it is followed by "advance".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a great step.
We have discussed our different views on what should be the form of a package for market stabilization," Democrat Nancy Pelosi said to the Bloomberg Agency.
He thinks the final vote can take place tomorrow.
The legislators' representatives met with Henry Paulson on Saturday night with the U.S. Minister of Finance to give a final form to the government board.
This should buy from financial companies unusable assets that cost financial companies serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
"We are committed to the final agreement on a plan that will work and which must be effective on the market at the same time.
I still need to continue the repair plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Note for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on participating markets, which are deeply rooted.
According to Harry Reid's so-called democratic senator, the legislators insist that they stay in Congress on Friday.
In the same way, investors would like to be satisfied before trade in Asian financial markets can be reduced, where the Congress's decision on trade in the week could have a first impact on the period.
However, it is still not clear, however, that when the two friends of the U.S. Congress vote on the law, as it were, the debate cannot be stopped at the last moment because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the following days.
However, the law goes through many more changes.
The total amount of aid for the system must be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which has been determined in more than $100 billion and at least 350 billion, if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may take this decision, the Congress may renew its successor.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea remained that the programme, which had acquired material tools for the purchase of value-added securities, had been acquired because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to destroy their securities.
"We all worked out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Friday and on Monday for the Senate," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said that the President was pleased with the progress on Saturday and appreciated the "two-part efforts to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of road terminals
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Ssenátus Bank Committee on Negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on their responsibility for the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from loss, closure of benefits and on the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also restricts the completion of the bus by the managers involved in the programme and establishes a basic supervisory committee.
The foundation should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes the assistance of owners who have problems with destruction.
The government should allocate new shares of waste to the signatories purchased by it, with the aim of reducing the monthly share of the debts and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Marek: Global aid
The proposed plan is David Marek, the director of Patria Finance, but it's going to be very difficult to implement.
"It's because it's not possible to know what the problem assets are with what mechanism and what price they're going to buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said iHNed.cz website Marek.
Marek doesn't think it's so important that the plan is left to you now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is much more important that the congressman should decide this week to support the plan and, as far as possible, give his award.
The importance of the spirit to bring about an agreement on the adoption of the plan is the most important thing at this time," Marek stressed.
Parharc in cash: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll help you answer that question.
While almost every mobile MP3 file can be downloaded, you can't call with any MP3 player.
It seems clear from this that it's better to buy a phone.
However, there's a lot to know that people get a special MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the existing owner.
It's probably hard to get a nice quality transmitter home to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc.
In part, such music products are not included in bans, but there are no objective reasons for this.
However, if Polish are full of art rock, jazz or blue lacquers, he probably dreams of such lightning.
This is similar to the way you travel, which is measured - simplifying with MP3.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
Some may not be able to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd district is likely to find it difficult to accept a meat crown market operator.
There's two virtues that everyone has enough room.
The choice is wide.
Life expectancy also depends on
Some quality music is much more powerful than the simple play of music, but even to which most mobiles do not even think so.
There's no one as universal as the phone.
Apart from the initial functions, telephone and text messages, music and video can also be played, both of them have a better or worse camera, which can even be browsed.
And if we take into account smartphones and communications, it'll be a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no heating machine can Grill and no television can take photos.
A number of functional mobile phones have their back.
The more you use your cell phone, the more you send it to the payee.
And music is one of the greatest energy ever.
Less mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the most simple) are significantly larger performances.
You can count on cheap cell phones so they won't play you in a couple hours.
If you're still on the phone here, you're going to get another supplement for your job for security. This is also about expensive preparations.
The MP3 players will not have such problems, and even worse ones will be able to carry out a continuous operation for at least 9 hours on a surface.
The next problem is to upload music to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connection and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be set directly to the memory card, but only a small card reader will turn around without a adapter with mini-AT card for use in mobile phones.
There is no need for any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
It's enough to load the equipment from the computer via USB.
The majority of mobile phones and players already create their own music library based on their evaluation of the provider, album name, type of operation or, for example, user.
Some of the products are just like the Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phone systems).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
The choice of a particular device would be of particular interest to the consumer's survival, memory capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course to the ease of treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and you listen to it for only a short time, for example, on the villamouse, any mobile that displays MP3 is suitable for you.
And that's actually any cell phone.
You don't have to pay more attention to what kind of music you know about your mobile or player.
The MP3 is all around, and most of the music that comes to you will be in such a way.
The MP3 is one of the most extensive and consists of a decision-making majority of the preparations in the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is smaller.
For example, it makes it possible for better mobile phones to buy online music.
Just visit the appropriate pages (or other service) on the mobile internet and buy the album.
This service can also be self-tested for the purchase of music.
Unfortunately, the provision of services is limited to just one-time radio broadcasts.
The prices are not the lowest.
Generally, however, music can be expected to be such a way of selling (or via GSM, Internet or without guidance) in the future.
Most people always keep their cell phones on their own.
Whenever you like to listen to something, your cell phone is stuck in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 home host.
However, it is still going on whether you always care for the audience or at least the audience.
If not, you can use the built-in audio player, with at least every cell, but only a small MP3 player.
For many, music phones will probably be the greatest advantage.
Most of the employees usually get less than three-month crowns.
There's a pretty decent walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
However, more than that, you are limited by the lack of a traditional farmer's output.
The most well-equipped telephones from the best and technical point of view can also be reached by traditional 3.5 mm light-emitting audiences.
At the same time, the benefits of operators are not limited to simple treatment.
The simplest - no means of dealing with the most common players (see our options) are really everyone.
A minimum function, a treatment similar to that of an earlier normal injection stomach or gramophone may appear.
There is no risk of a merger in the form of an undisclosed mobile internet, and there is no risk of the following serious account for data transmission.
What are we going to do? What are we going to do?
The most popular mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to live memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By adding the appropriate card to the two largest corner of the interior.
But be careful.
Base types only support 2GB maximum capacity cards.
Only the most expensive can start with at least 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have your mobile phone and even a cheap MP3 player you would like to buy, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsongo, Emgeton or irate.
On the basis of capacity (max. 2 GB) no more than 1 100 kroner should be paid.
If it belongs to the most important audiences, choose more special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungok).
These preparations also have special MP3 controller pumps, so the ease of treatment approaches MP3 inducer.
The most popular in the sector is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones are channeled Walkman have the same user interface as the special equipped MP3 players.
The above-mentioned brands can provide the same service of MP3 receivers for up to four thousand korons in the same category, but with greater memory capacity (or 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, at least 35 hours).
The first virtual service still came to Chechnya.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market has been generally developed and our services are virtually the same as their Pacific European partners.
However, there is something we lack here - a virtual service that makes it difficult for classic service providers to afford a significant price reduction.
Maybe it won't be long.
The Mobile.cz website has long said that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
In addition, the CTU also confirmed that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is higher than that of other countries in the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission's regulation of roaming charges, it may therefore be possible to find a situation contrary to the situation - some mobile phones from abroad will be cheaper in their homes.
How is it possible to compare the prices of the Czech Republic with that of Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking in the competition that really wants to go to war.
This may sound counterargument because we have three mobile phones and the penetrations are up to 100%.
On the contrary, mobile servers are reluctant to complain that the Czech market is highly competitive.
In line with this, Paul Dvorás, also president of the Czech Telecommunications Office, once again stated that there is no new servant in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that your own network of classic service no longer has too many possibilities (but it would probably be too difficult to find frequency).
However, there is another possibility - the virtual server.
A significant decrease in the price of mobile mobile services, followed by a significant reduction in the number of virtual servers, followed by the response of the classical service providers.
Nearly before the start of the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile Great Britain, similar sounds were heard.
However, he has proved that such ministers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we don't have to go too far.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking's virtual airport service.
This service provider will not be able to acquire more than 100 thousand clients over a period of half a year and will become the largest 5th service provider in the country.
Nearly behind Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which is owned by U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much larger target group.
For effective operation, the same standard service requires a much smaller customer.
It is not the same as the relatively high construction, mobile and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world are generally offered low cost - cheap calls and text messages, which are often opposed to less services.
For example, the Great-British Tesco Mobile offers at least five percent of its competitors.
But as the example of Poland's Mobilking shows, it can be a good move for a target group.
This service is the same special focus for men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service - they like them who can trust," says David Seibert, director of the Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual service.
It's hard to say whether we can choose a picture like Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is generally small in relation to the relative approach, based on the majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, the provision of services has been relatively satisfactory."
In the Czech Republic, there are no opportunities for mobile service providers.
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about successful dissemination of this project, but in the Czech Republic the agreements do not seem to be too promising.
In order to launch Mobilking, more of our regions will be listed in other countries," said Jana Studničk, head of the Penta Financial Group in his phone interview to Mobil.cz.
In the meantime, it has proved that the existing mobile services in the Czech Republic are not too sensitive to this idea.
On the contrary, all of them are forced to do their utmost in order not to create any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has no longer been interested in starting a virtual service, which therefore wishes to take a new step towards becoming a real competitor of the company's Telephonica O2.
"We are very interested in providing mobile telecommunications services not only to our clients but also to our clients.
The sooner you get, the better.
We talked again about this opportunity with every cell service.
Some of us have already made progress in the negotiations," says Paul Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe better times come now.
It appears that we can be happy with the first virtual service by the end of the year.
However, the birth of a child is about to take place in the first place.
"At this point we do not think that a fully-valued virtual service would be a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very different from the other markets.
He has not always talked about us alone, a subject that offers complex and serious projects in this area," he said about the Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršeń, the Telefónica 02 media department.
The Czech market's special situation is also referred to by other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile's spokesman, adds with an exception to O2: "We have not yet noticed a single viable and two-way business project that could continue to be based on."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network, it is unlikely that we will be able to find any virtual servers by the end of the year.
At this point, there should already be a particular agreement on the table so that it can be considered at such a short time."
Vodafone pays more attention to the implementation of its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepicky adds: "We are new to the possible negotiations with virtual service providers, primarily in the area of sharing of costs and infrastructure.
From the point of view of our clients, this is what we think is the most cost-effective thing.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to partner in building fast mobile networks."
Responsible authorities - a bridge with service providers
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, a new service entry would mean increased competition, price reduction and this would reduce their profits.
So why would we make it easier to get into such a competition?
When service providers are able to work together, they also witness the mystery of the U.S. birth.
The biggest pressure on the ČTU was probably caused by the birth of T-Mobile's U phone.
This information is publicly available on the CTU website.
But right now the U:phone comes as a good idea why we don't let the virtual server in.
Martina Kemrova added: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently undermined the entry into the fourth mobile service market.
In view of the presence of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that a new player's entry into the market and service will support high requirements."
However, in view of this approach by mobile service providers, the full lack of interest in Czech regulatory bodies is equally evident.
It is not only about the accession of the Czech Republic, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries in the Czech Republic, does not have the right to engage in economic competition.
This is only entitled to the Economic Competitiveness.
However, the Bureau is significantly concerned about the whole problem.
"The approach of the virtual service mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider is concluded on the basis of the necessary infrastructure.
They have not yet concluded any such contract, since the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not appropriate for traditional service providers," Kristián Chlapua, from the special section of the Economic Competitiveness Department, said in response to our question.
No one would be surprised by such a statement from the representatives of the service.
However, from this point of view, which should represent the interests of consumers and in addition to the fact that no one can live back on the market, this is more than a strange one.
It's excellent if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual service is usually operated, we can note that our market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the market environment does not fall within the interests of the EU.
In fact, many of the three mobile-service reactions are entirely consistent.
The question is, if it's really just a misunderstanding, it's a matter of self-esteem.
However, in the plenary, the very same petrols are definitely only the inconsistencies and hard competition operations.
"The Authority has not highlighted the signs of the unfair procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
One service does not have a leading position, i.e. no greater responsibility for market realities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing for the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
Showing the market leadership situation is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, which is based on telecommunications from the single market in the face of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, there is no single Czech service provider in a driving position.
However, some legal experts offer another view - approval of the network operator is always necessary for the establishment of the virtual service provider.
And the mobile service has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain age, it's necessary to dominate.
But even if we don't accept this idea, it should be at least important for the EU to have three mobile service providers in a similar way.
The complaints of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that they are facing very similar obstacles during the negotiations with all service providers.
And ČTU's claim of responsibility is a rather common trick in telecommunications, which the EU will take away from the whole case.
We've met with this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the CTU's legal framework in the field of economic competition has not been possible in telecommunications, although many experts have hoped to improve the situation.
Those representatives of the Lord should know this well, but they are likely to have other interests in mind.
It works when no one pays attention
In general, there are a number of types of virtual service providers that are already operating in Czech mobile markets.
These are companies offering their own mobile service prices, however, which are only partially publicised.
It's about companies dealing with marketing with the same multilevel.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
These companies' prices usually go only to the chosen ones.
The miracle is that the company acts as a classic company client against the service provider, which provides a large amount of SIM card.
You will receive special offers (and other preferences) after being selected as customers.
The problem is that every Czech mobile service trading conditions are hampered by similar prejudices.
"If there were any cases to be dealt with, it could be a breach of contract conditions which we would be working on and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered our question regarding this problem.
But it is unlikely that news of the effect would have reached the responsible people of the mobile service.
First of all, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be more than a thousand clients.
In general, no service provider shall protect against such a procedure.
These companies have the same unfavourable profits from their activities and, in contrast with the actual virtual services, they are not particularly threatened by their official markets.
Miroslav Čepický warned about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but the services of these companies are only used by customers as a percentage of their customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not part of their name, so they cannot be fully available as mobile services' general clients."
But the CTU should at least be surprised at this.
In addition, another question arises for the Lord.
If mobile servers have lost their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual server?
It is necessary to ensure that the EAGGF has a substantial right to carry out its activities, and if it does not wish, it should not be satisfied with the explanation given by the service providers that they have not done anything like this and that their trading conditions are impeded.
When we won't be the most precious
While the text has been cited several times, access to virtual servers has brought the mobile market a significant decline in the price of services.
In general, in all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classical service providers have tried to stop their creation from being more or less.
The ideas they used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied markets, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, regulatory bodies have been introduced at these moments, which have not yet been protected by mobile service providers but by their clients.
Then they achieved either formal measures or information printing that created the first virtual service followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are paying the whole case to each other.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot free ourselves from the pressure that unexplained competences come well to us in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service is really soon to appear to us, maybe the Czech mobile market is moving again.
If any of the service providers would allow any virtual mobile service provider to be established, the ÚOHS may only be able to remain in public for the purpose of avoiding further interested parties (to discrimination).
And for the rest of Europe, maybe we won't call more expensive.
The new heaven has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to four translations of the new version of the Czech State.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolán celebrated the day of the Czech State at my home.
The sky was set up by the National Film House with the leadership of Jiří Bélohlav.
Four versions are available - with male or female speakers, with songs or instruments.
Catherine the Queen and Adam Plachetka sing.
Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the heavenly revision.
The iHNed.cz website can listen to all four versions.
Illustrations are one of the most beautiful celestial phenomena in the Czech nation.
Cseh Radio has previously said that he has chosen young, representative voices for the resolution of these variations, which are expressive and popular.
"If it were both of us from the beginning, and later on in the music, I would agree to the clear dictation, to the meaning of the text and to deal with the harmony," he said.
The 175th anniversary of the Czech state heaven for the future.
Where's my home? a dall was first set up in the Rendi Film House in 1834 in the bar of Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, healing with the music of the French Škroup.
It became simple, and people considered themselves spontaneous.
And after the collapse of 1918, the first race of Dal became a natural part of state heaven.
After the collapse of the Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
How's "new" heaven?
For the first time, the Prague transport company also sends its chip card
On 1 October 2008, he shall be registered as the date of entry into the history of the Czech Republic when he enters the metro, villamos and buses on the first road, which will be an electronic cup of paper in the pocket.
The coupon can now be obtained by about a hundred people with the Opencard chip card.
Travellers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can also travel on their chips at the Information Centres of the Transport Authority at Museum, Museums, Museums, Nádraží Holešovice, Angelí, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylissy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka Metro stations.
The coupons are also available online from yesterday through the Transport Authority’s website www.dpp.cz.
The service has been used by more than four hundred customers in South Atlantic hours.
Those who start using the internet trade can effectively forget the cost levels of the metro stations where they have to carry out a long series of lines on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased the same way over the Internet and also saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen sons of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.
"In these places there is a pool of trained service providers who help interested people to buy online and buy their purchased coupons," said Martin Opatrný, project's spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will also be available in some pre-filled cars.
How do these cars look?
Pirosas, the reporters were reminded and the passengers may have noticed them at the Metro stations Roztyly, Budějovicca, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltovská.
"There are now five of them in the city, but they should be eight by the end of the year," Opatrní added.
The coupon is automatically controlled by the driver instead of the driver
It's easy to deal with automatics starting tomorrow.
It's enough to place the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved from yourself.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital but also in the environment.
Thus, from 300 to 499 buses and bus stations, which are the first to travel to the capital by the people of the Central and Eastern countries.
"In respect of the integrated transport of Prague, fisheries have been identified with maple readings, which also help determine the catch effectiveness of coupons," explained the control of the lines by Philip Drapal from Ropid, who compiled the list of goods transport.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are in charge of the money bank.
The driver must therefore show not only the chip card at the time of arrival, but also the Opencard must be placed at the designated location on the currency page.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is easier to ask the driver for this," Drapal said.
Travelers who do not travel by bus from city to city and who do not remember to buy when it comes down can go back to self-sustained cars.
The information on the validity of their documents is shown here in the device identifier.
The cops wanted a vote from the U.S.
In 1945 the Germans were asked to join the United States in Shumava.
This is from the letter contained in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Georgia.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
This was the result of this desire by some German groups that were defeated in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is also evident from a letter from a private archipelago that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Georgia in our day.
The Germans of Česky Krumlov, in writing, ask the US President not to allow the return of the "shuavai" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has already concluded under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly explained the situation and we really want to be sure that the American teams are in the words that say that they are no longer persecuted and hostile to the German territories, but are becoming freer," says the letter, "People who take the Shumava series into their hearts" with the words.
Since joining the Czech Republic stands for the Germans - in addition to being known by the Czech national character - can only give hope to brutality, intolerance, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asks the US President to take over the protection "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of the four million inhabitants, this area would be judged by a foreign country that I am proud of and proud of the minority, and would not have anything to do with the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The reason why the contractors couldn't sign is that I'm afraid of the "cseh pressure" noise.
If, therefore, the President of the United States were to question the opinion of the Swimming Germans, it would be sufficient for the Swimming Group to refer to whether its people want to become part of the United States and want to live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the text may seem somewhat naive to the current knowledge of the postwar history, it does, according to some historians, reflect the expectations of the Germans who claim to be here.
Even if the Czechs had to minimize the possibility of establishing their country, only a few of them were aware of this.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to stand in the same kind of autonomy of the accused.
Still others were confident that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also true of Gustav Chalupa, a journalist born in the Czech Republic.
Chalupa served at the Baltic Sea as a Buddhist German during the war.
When the British were arrested and taken to the Dutch concentration camp at the end of the war, thousands of other Germans came to teach them how to hunt.
"They were confident that if they were to return home, the Czech language would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in pre-war Czechoslovakia were considered to have been expelled from the country on the basis of the Benez decrements.
You don't think you're paying!
The sensitive campaign attacks leaders
In the case of the Czech Republic, the most expensive action for road safety.
It could also be marked by the media campaign which would like to start tomorrow with the Ministry of Transport.
Aleš Rébeček's ministry from this campaign is hoping to eliminate the leaders from the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, on radio, on music, on the Internet, but also on dictionary.
Leaders should be removed from rapid consumption and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that they're breaking down security doors before they get up.
First of all, young leaders, motorists, soldiers, and not least officials want to be known for their inspiration.
And what's going on in the ads?
It's a human experience that attacks feelings, first of all.
The whole campaign's "blood" slogan also testifies to this:
You don't think you're paying!
The term "you don't think" is written in large letters on the system.
And in his blood, you're paying for it.
This should indicate that a person can pay for a temporary negligence in his life.
The viewers are "remote" until 2010.
The ministry has been used by campaigns similar to those in the English countries where victims of disasters can be regularly seen.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the streets of the Czech Republic.
The ads were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Move it, pick it up for the passengers.
"To the passengers, it's an appropriate order to 'take me, pick me up'.
The 'distribute' for our numbers when they're going through the pyroson, so they're saving time.
'Take him' is a risk of punishment or accident.
The driver has to be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a neurologist at Na Homolce Kórhaz.
And that's why you need the information campaign in the press, first of all, the negative campaign, the psychology.
He considered the driver's attention to be less effective than the risk tables.
"If there is an alert table for danger, you are likely to be in contact with the environment and the leaders are not dealing with it," Kořan warned.
At least one person would return all the areas left behind to peace.
Ehud Olmer, the President of the Interim Government of Israel, spoke of the return of practically all areas left in 1967, namely the rest of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golans, to peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview which he published on the day of the week to Jediot Akhron.
"We have to stand with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of us have to return the entire (distributed) area," Olmert told the map.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians need to transfer a similar percentage of Israel's territories, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He recognized that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and first of all wants tractors and bugs not to cross, as one of my best friends has done, must give up part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert following two July cities that killed some people and injured several thousands.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple's Highness, Saints and Historical Places" in the city.
"Those who want to protect Israel's sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270 000.
It won't work," he stressed.
Exclusion of Golan fans
He also expressed an opinion on Israel's withdrawal from Golan, according to which there was an irreconcilable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he said.
"The hearts are well aware of what they have to say in order to get Golant.
They must provide current contacts with Iran; contact with Hezbollah (a foreign movement); support provided by Hamas (a foreign movement), Al-Qaida and Dzshad (a holy war) terrorism in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
After the accident: Are the trainers illegal in the buses?
The law doesn't know them. You don't have to drive in a remote bus.
In connection with the tragic bus bus crash of the Student Agency, the question arose near Padova, whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus.
"If we want to keep the law strictly and formally, the travel activities are contrary to the law on transport," says Karel Hanselka, director of the Ministry of Transport.
In the past week, a two - year - old passenger died probably caused by a truckload of truckloads crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at least in a safe place, although there were two more places for her.
The bus may explode, or it may suddenly be expected even when you serve on the way for coffee or offer news.
It is important to know whether the bus is available under the marketing authorisation.
If there's no approval in the bus, the passengers need to sit down.
The Student Agency's remote bus stations do not have seats; which is confirmed by Radim Jancúra, the manager of the company.
"We tried to find a solution to this ministry, but the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, they refused, and we came to the point that passengers could go to the hotel while they were sitting on their own," he said.
The law doesn't recognize the passport.
"There is no clear rule of law on the role of travel - no law regulates this position.
However, no law prohibits the provision of services by the passenger.
The road traffic law knows only the laws of the driver; it does not determine his rights and obligations," says Hanselka.
Josef Pokorny, director of the road vehicle business department of the Ministry of Transport, is against the view that the law is dealing with the problem.
"It depends on whether the bus is involved in the marketing authorisation.
And it's over," she says.
According to their differences, buses may be cities where they are located and limited to the maximum speed, with the highest speed and allowed to stay in the city, and with the maximum speed and seating available to the city without any distance.
Like on the plane, the expert says
Jaroslav Horín, the BESIP transport safety expert has no underlying problem in the movement of passengers on the bus.
"In the process of moving, there is no risk of much danger, we can compare the situation to the service at the airport.
It's not safe here when there's turbulence and air pollution.
"If, however, the bus would soon arrive, of course, its physical laws are valid.
Just like in the city buses or villas.
The safety of passengers should be resolved by the driver's internal rules," he says and at the same time feels that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jancura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency provides travel services as a single bus passenger.
He's been working two hundred passengers.
The director does not consider his employment to be at risk after the accident.
"But as I am pressured to do so, the occupation of passengers is dangerous, and I have also given up.
The coffee and the news can be obtained when the passengers arrive.
This would also be budget saving," she says.
The lack of passengers was due to safety concerns in his vehicles, Alexej Litvin, the head of Asia, who works for the student Agency.
"There are no passengers, we're going to resist this from the beginning.
Before or after this happens with some deadly injury," he told Tyden.cz a year ago.
An amazing tragedy occurred.
The company's two-year-old blueman was killed during a violent riot.
Without the use of a driver’s license, the Slovenian truck was probably damaged by the stop and lost its way to the bus.
The bus driver suddenly forced him out of the mansion, but the bus's better-than-first part pushed him off.
It would also have been sold to Jancúra to two permanent places that would serve the rest of the passengers.
"These places can't be taken off the road, they're blocked."
The company wants to join the truck driver.
The Agency is not waiting for the court to judge her family, but it is also waiting for financial damage to be committed.
Amendment of the Rules?
In the future
To clarify the movement of passengers in the bus could be the amendment of the legislation, which works for more than one year by a three-year expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"The group, however, did not have any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the focus system is on the parking lot at the maximum speed allowed and the average mobile use," says a expert named Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not hold on to the activities of passengers which would primarily threaten the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes with the fact that monitoring the safety of buses belongs to the police and the employment offices.
The hopes of the Düsseldorf are beyond Frankfurt.
A letter from the WestLB administration to the bank's employees does not appear in large words.
The Düsseldorf financial institutions and the Frankfort Deka Bank's merger could create "the central capital market organisation of the financial group" - write a letter published on Monday.
The WestLB will introduce a "competition block" to such a business.
Such a relationship could give rise to further mergers in the banking sector in question.
This is when a government wants to prove its performance in difficult times.
As the unconfirmed WestLB bank continues to suffer considerable pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also part of the Union Financial Service Supervisory Authority, which has recently been informed by the Government of the People's Republic of the North-Westphalia, that it is due to a deadline for finding a durable solution.
However, there is already a good time between Deka-Bank and WestLB for bankers on the basis of investments.
Franz Waas, head of the Deka-Bank at the end of August, knew that the bank located in Mainzer Landstraße and a holding bank, such as the Helaba or WestLB fusion, did not understand.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, which is one of the banks in question and one of the representatives of the stock exchange financial associations, has entrusted the Authority to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
At this time, the capital market business or certain parts of it may become part of it.
However, the negotiations - which are financial circles - have just begun.
The name Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not first appear in relation to the consolidation of the financial sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank was in agreement with the Landesbank Rhineland-Pfalzcal and Helaba.
However, nothing has been done from this third alliance.
The plan was almost publicized, and the Helaba government was opposed to the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks didn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Baden-Württemberg instead of the Landesbank.
However, the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the banks concerned was renewed and renewed.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against the plans of mergers with his bank.
Regardless of this, it is recognized that there is a need for the approach of the various banks of the international sector.
Now, following the country's indigenous collection elections, BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected to be contacted first.
For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure on further fusions increases, possible partners may be arrested as soon as possible.
In South Germany it could only be more powerful business, which has caused the financial crisis to be so much worse than the Munich and the Situtgar banks.
The merger with WestLB was closed at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thürgen, 85% of Helaba.
The NordLB is better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the human being.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks are related to each other.
In June Merl stated that the German Takare Bank and the Union had not yet given an answer to the decision-making question as to what business model to provide for the future of the banks in question.
Finally, it is possible to imagine the WestLB's surrender, however, which they do not want to understand.
In this way, the letter of the home administration also states that they are entitled to a "full solution" at all times.
How this can be consistent with the combination of some units with Deka-Ban, the next song.
The second weekend of October was known as "the end of the week"
Elena's the first, Luca's the third or fourth time.
Now Elena's here as friends, and so everything else, says Luca.
There is a strong-tested professional man in front of the Kaiser brand's five-way store, and it proves to some 200 people who travel to Octoberfestre how deep they can predict sounds from the tower.
Elena first glanced Luca's face and then kissed her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the four bus bus from Porta Nuova páyaudvar to the car park goes from 23.45 o'clock to 23.45 o'clock with "Destinion Monaco, festa della bira" destination, arriving at 6.30 o'clock.
Three buses are held up by the Italians, only in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already climbed up to their castle, and they've started the celebration in the night.
And it's so loud that it's not true to the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who has a long, artificial coat and a wide, comfortable eyebrow.
He's been traveling to Octoberfest for five years. He's only organized three trips this year.
It's there tonight, at 8:30 p.m. in October.
The hotel would only mean extra expenses, says Marco.
The road goes to 75 euros, which includes a German language brochure carried out in Marco Frankfurt.
And they're already taking you to Brenner's parking lot tonight.
No sir. Not yet.
The bus will be down soon, the passengers will be asleep.
That's all right. They'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are many Italian buses in the 8th car park that hold a short drop in front of Munich.
When Marco's team arrives at the parking lot near Theresienweise, there are about 50 other buses that he liked coming from Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are going to the meetings, Marco still holds one last informant, informs us of his plan.
First: Everybody pick up the scarf.
On this left-hand side of the fractur's letter "Octoberfest" can be read as well as the internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersivijaggingando.it".
The second time, "When the sirens open, run" says Marco in the morning.
"Fout!" Booking places in the back of the hall and the back of the hall.
"Not before, because we're going to sleep, and don't sit on the same steps all the way down, but we're going to put him in the chair!"
The single course is going to Euro 8.25, mark Marco.
And don't forget about the burrow.
"Show the security guards that you've been treated well.
If you leave the places, they'll arrest you."
Third time, "You'll be back here at about noon tonight!" Do you understand?
And it's already on Wiesn.
In the course of one man's journey, he binds sharp sticks to the trees, tables, and also one of the big poor people's choice plate.
You've got to get ready for your withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of October, known as "the end of the week".
There are no accurate figures; 50 thousand people are talking about crossing the Alps in the mountains, and 10 percent of all visitors come from Italy at the end of the week.
Seven Southern Tyrian police officers strengthen the Bajor Red Cross, which is home to about 200 Italian doctors in its national statistics, precipitating districts (kb.80) and the British to the worst point in the world (kb. 60).
In the Italian area, Hofbräu was particularly popular.
Unbelievable Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system was relatively stable and stressed by Peer Steinbrück's Federal Minister of Finance only last week.
Fortunately, politicians have used the word "on a regular basis" and have even concluded that the German banking sector is not characterised by crisis developments.
Because this is the end of the week.
Daxon's company, named Müncheni Hypo Real Estate (HRE), received billions of loans from the German banks' consortium to protect itself against market turbulence.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters every week that credit support is worth EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should only be paid after part of its demand.
The money comes from private and private banks.
In the back there are losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
Depfa, who makes state funding for long-term projects according to a news report, has paid money and has refinanced itself for a very short period of time - which is no longer possible due to market uncertainty.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s financial resources decreased by EUR 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million and its own capital share dropped by 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Net revenue from the current and financial flows will be returned to zero over the same period of the previous year, from the approvals and from certain securities for the purposes of the claim, and from the calculation of the purpose of the loan, more than EUR 5 million will be recovered by a reduction of 70 percent.
Only the higher revenue from the final cost of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the loss of the assets under the mandate and the relatively low turnover of the companies concerned, were significantly reduced by 16%.
Following the privatization in 1990, the former State co-financer had previously been involved with corporate property loans which were later granted to the Aeral Bank.
Since classical State funding could be sought less, Depfa has been involved more strongly in infrastructure projects, private investors and public-private partnerships (PPP), and has expanded its activity internationally.
For subsidiary companies, the Hypo Real Estate should now carry out descriptions that are "lightly effective" to show the group's results - generally published.
It's true that class payments didn't happen.
The division has already been reduced to the third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major public and infrastructure funder since the transfer of Depfa.
Other financial institutions are better dependent on the refinancing of the central banking market because they do not have clients.
The American Lehman Brothers Investment Bank, two weeks ago, sold its credit to each other as banks kept their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate is a part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about EUR 50 billion - needed for short-term tools to finance the year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the group's funding requirement has been covered by credit available time, and the company has protected "from the impact of the currently highly operational international financial markets."
According to other sources, money is secured by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the HRE Board of Directors, stated that the financial markets should not be required until the Hypo Real Estate group is available.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Service Service (BaFin) see that the Hypo Real Estate Group's market capacity is now being ensured.
It gives hope to bank participants and creditors.
But because of the dynamics of the crisis and the inconsistencies of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
Even it is not impossible to imagine that funding should not be fully required.
But this opposition can't be stopped.
After the late Saturday evening news, the bank was still standing on the side of your chest, yet the temporary rescue was not able to calm down the treatment.
The share volume dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they hold themselves as well as the bonds.
As the first duty rate changes slightly, the subsequent fixed bonds are significantly reduced.
In particular, the crisis affects the former subsidiary, the Württemberg Hypo bonds and, in a possible way, over-times in 2009.
As long as the Hypo Real Estate bonds have been shown as a speculative investment alternative, the values must now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system and because the financial institution has taken the crisis home through Depfa.
However, as long as the records, governments and less-hazardous business banks are ready to support the system, it may be withdrawn from the expiry date.
Or it will be the result of which no one at present can hope to cope with the financial crisis within the next 15 months.
However, the detailed State reports have shown that there is still a legitimate hope for certainty.
Long-term creditors may cause sleepless nights to decide whether to choose from their investment.
However, short-term investors can use the sale in order to maintain the taxable value after the years to come.
Sylvana and the bentos box secrets
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to hate: The German girl is always "cavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the nandas - you're telling about Japan in the new ceserdia blog.
"The first day of education in Japan.
I was so excited.
I've been on my way to school.
I'm on my way to Tokyo, to Kavaszaki, and I'm on my 40-minute journey to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone. I didn't regret it.
It seems that the start of the study in Tabanana does not take as seriously as it did at home in Alsó-Szászor.
The students start talking from eight o'clock until 8 o'clock at 40 o'clock, a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, I had the chance to show it.
And I'm not the kind of guy who talks to people, mostly in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old habit in my apartment, plus blue, blue teratriot and black leather.
So in this dress I was standing in front of the table and I tried to say everything right: "Sajonara, vo or Sylvana..." - called Sylvana, I came from Germany, and it will be a week after my birthday.
At this point, I was very happy that I had been learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were angry, angry, and upset, and I heard the word "cavia" on the way.
I already knew that from my own.
This belongs to Japanese girls' basics, and it means "cuki, sweet."
Then I went to my place fast.
The girl standing next to me was very smiling, and she felt honored that she was sitting next to the ceserdia.
The back of the clock was quite quiet, but when he spoke of it, they usually broke up.
Everyone spoke and talked together, and their questions were raised - and it was hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
After the fall, everyone packed their pen.
My visitor has also prepared me such a meal - it's completely different from the German noble ten-year-old sandwiches.
I've got a lot of rice, little cloves, butter and orange salad, fruit and one kind of beef.
Most of the time I don't know what I'm feeling here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they've got a completely new drink.
I mean, everything's very nice.
Well, maybe with the exception of the ice cream, brrrrrr!
In Japanese schools, the bento is not just a meal.
In the meantime, a girl is offering her own handmade penthouse, which is especially artificially together, in the hope that she can get to know her son more closely at the restaurant.
I read about this in my old pictures.
I'm curious if I can watch this.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Because you're just freaking out."
I've been reading you for years.
And that I better understand the pictures and the culture I described, I used to start learning Japanese.
It was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're in a lot of trouble here.
Japan is one of the most recent techniques and trends - and another is strict, armed and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats have feelings too.
They're going for a pack or a soft accident.
Joseph LeDoux neurological scientist has been convinced that animals also have feelings.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they treat us the same way?
The online journal Edge has published the articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE is one of the series "What do you think is true without proving it?" from the answers you asked.
I believe that animals have feelings and other knowledge, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, it's true that we can't even prove that other people have knowledge.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human beings is the same.
However, as we examine other types of things, and in the sense of feeling or generalizing the issues of knowledge, we find it difficult to get to the ground because the hardware is not united.
When a cat gets into danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: He makes himself dead, go away, or attack you.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in similar subjective experiences from some researchers.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to relate our own subjective experiences to animals.
Human knowledge-related price circles are almost always included in the page's pre-frontal application (because of its role in the short-term memory and in the implementation/manufacturing functions).
This vast area is more developed in the case of man than in other major factors, and it seems to be completely lacking in other living things.
At least our knowledge of the aspects that depend on the pre-frontal brain, for example who we are, or if we are able to design and make decisions, we can rightly assume that man is different from other major factors.
Another dramatic feature is in the human language: Since human experience is an important part of language, it is often said that knowledge depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it does not depend on the language, the language will definitely influence, so that animal knowledge, whatever its nature, is likely to differ strongly from most of our knowledge.
It is therefore difficult to determine what knowledge can be given to other animals.
If knowledge is not possible as an internal and subjective thing, and because of special hardware, it cannot be eliminated on the basis of our own experience, then our research is causing serious problems for us.
Most of my research concerns the content of knowledge, but there is also another aspect of knowledge that is likely to be more accessible to science.
Animals could be examined without regard to the content of their knowledge processes, and that is precisely what happens in the case of short-term memories of major humans, especially in the case of visualisation.
However, during this condition examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they are more likely to support foreign relations than the causal mechanisms: they can both be the same, not the same.
Interestingly, this statement also highlights the importance of the pre-frontal spectrum in the creation of visualisation.
What's going on with this feeling?
This leads me back to activating an emotional system, such as fear, in a clean way with its own activities.
What we call "trembling" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the system's activity (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is taken into account.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the areas of the brain that are characterized by the main human beings and especially by the human beings.
The sign of language is characterized by fine progress because with words and language we are able to distinguish and categorize states to describe them to others along with us.
In this regard, for example, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from the simpler activities of the brain and the nervous system, such as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can play an easy role in general emotions.
I don't think I can figure this out, but I don't think I can prove it.
Panxeep thinks that what appears to be a fear of rats and humans is probably both of them feeling the same: How can you check that rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
If you're going out in danger, does he feel afraid?
I believe that such behavior has not yet been proved by the same experience.
While neurological interaction continues to help: our brains are like rats and humans, however, there are no brains for cats.
But is the surgeon responsible for the feelings?
And even if this could be true of people, how can we prove this in the case of these packs?
I think the packs and other furniture, but maybe even the shoes (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their feelings are basically different from ours (because human knowledge is based on special customs and language), I'm looking at the emotional behavior of the packs rather than the emotional feelings.
In any case, there is a delay in movement in this area at the neurological level, where we measure the same with rats and humans.
Since I don't look for language and knowledge in the case of the packs, I don't know if they exist.
Others may appear to be a short-term attitude, but they are more likely to die than they are to be constantly suffocated.
Because I'm a practicing emotionalist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Ageing for Poland and Ukraine
Mr Ivan Vasjunik, Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, announced that preparations will be made soon under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government, in its decision by UEFA Bordeaux, sees the confidence and evidence in Ukraine that they believe Ukraine is capable of organizing the European Union together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there are many more interesting countries in both countries."
For the construction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both of which are left in the country of residence.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced by eight.
"We can't be infected for more time.
We have to work with luck now," said Grigory Szurkiss, President of the Association of Red Cross in Ukraine.
"The UEFA will keep our eyes on us."
In Poland, they were even more radical.
Following a number of bombings, the National Olympic Commission suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which Robert Zawlocki was sure to have changed.
The Commission met at the initiative of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewick.
Drzewecki told the Polish PAP press about "the risk that PZPN is not able to operate under the rules" - Drzewecki said.
"We have written to assure Michel Platini, President of the UEFA that this will not adversely affect the EU's 2012 preparations."
Only in recent years have several first-line teams had to be manipulated into the lower class, and finally the ligastart had to be fished.
Dennis Quaid's fight back.
The dancer would like to advertise a new film, talk about his own life - and now he's got a problem with his ex-husband. With Ryan Hollywood, he named his former husband, Dennis Quaided.
The One Who Hides and Backs
He is preparing to fight Russians at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-wife: The two Hollywood dancers have been fighting each other for seven years after the answer - before the public.
With Ryan in his interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, he first said about the reasons for the answer: "Dennis was very angry with me, which caused many pain."
Only after the election did you know how many women Dennis married.
Ryan's new "The Women" movie on the spirit stripper, which tells about a marriage breakup.
Dennis Quaid responded firmly to the plea for an angry husband: "Great" - the 54-year-old dancer told the "New York Daily News" page, "that He will repeat and transform the history of our relationship."
In addition, it's "dedicated" that 16-year-old common boys, Jack again "are clearly reminded of the many pain and change that makes it a child."

The prices of airport tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European airports and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, in Germany airports were not less than 50 percent cheaper.
Airports and hotel prices have become even more favourable - thus the results of one of the American Express travel and financial service studies.
The company destroyed its first half-2008 booking data and established a significant price increase in the second quarter following the first quarter.
After the prices grew in the hotel market for years, the hotels became more cheap.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 European cities surveyed for 2007.
However, by the time of April, the number of prices had already decreased by 3.6 percent over the previous year.
This trend was shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year ago.
This is why the American Express is seen in the low dollar price that led to "the American tourist's pleasure of walking."
Reduced hotel rooms are better suited to financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hannover, Colnt or Stavanger.
In Norway, 26.3 percent of hotel prices are counted as European records.
A growing trend in airport prices has also been shown in the first quarter.
Travelers were expected to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-term long-term flights needed for large fuel were attracted by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of the tourist class aircraft decreased by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, however, the business and the first class showed only a marked change in prices.
In Germany prices were even higher than in other European countries.
Between January and March prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the price of domestic aircraft in Germany decreased.
The reason for the decrease in prices is partly due to economic growth – it is the company’s establishment.
The flight market has weakened its search for several weeks.
On the other hand, after the Open Skies Agreement on the liberalisation of air travel between the United States and Europe, the pressure exerted by the competition situation is strengthened.
The situation in question confirms that airlines are destroying their losses and that in the first half of 2008 there were a number of airlines reported that it was only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV 1:0 true to Gladbachot
The Hamburger SV is based on a simple and simple way of life on the table.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luhukakay is still unable to meet the operational team.
Christopher Klein's promotion Deep flight for the nationally elected Marco Marin.
The gladbachi player just walked into the game later, and his attention returned from the cappair.
The exact message he received left the door convinced.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second floor," said Hermann Rieger on his way to the Hamburg Arena.
Not much has happened in the catacombs, the fall has ended, and most of them have stayed in their place.
Rieger was about three years old with HSV physical therapy, enjoying a greater perspective than some hairy players.
That's how his request was heard at the appropriate location.
Cornelius Jol was an assistant in pain, and he showed his attention.
Cornelius is the leader of the hamburger, Martin Jol's brother.
His command could have been similar: Here's the second floor.
The execution of the command remains.
"Today wasn't always a good sight," she later introduced Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "was more creative" about the thing.
The positive outcome of the hamburgers is thanks to Mladen Petric’s head (11); and the fact that very weak gladbachies could not cause pain to weak hamburgers.
"It was a great victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this week.
The spectators have already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoons, the arena snowflakes and the table on the outside, which has shown them to be part of the poor class.
It'll be a birthday without a party.
"We know where we're going," said Marcell Jansen.
It is noted that the evidence between the table is more quantifiable than that of the HSV Dominance.
Although the team was later bound by its contracts - thanks to Brazil's name and Silva, Caps Petric and the FC Bayern - you will soon find yourself, but it is still not brilliant.
"We need more feelings and action," Jol demanded.

Sudden matter affects the flight of the vertebrates
A mysterious presence has been causing unconstitutionalism among researchers for years. The dark matter affects the speed of the regions during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts believe that Albert Einstein’s general relativity quality cannot be fully established.
"Ulysses" has been flying around in the world for nearly 18 years.
It's a threat to the cold. It's a threat to the cold.
Over the years scientists have been plagued by a mysterious phenomenon, the Swing-by anomalies.
Swing-by means the gravitational gravitational force of the gravitational zones, which is being added to the air, for example in the gravitational area of the Earth.
This is how the salts can feed a large amount of food.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research team used this physical printing at the Ulysses daily level.
What researchers have been doing for years, however: Aircraft objects do not act as expected on the basis of ancient gravity law.
Instead, irregularities occur at the speed.
The suns are suddenly up or down.
The physicists have not always found an explanation for this effect.
The presence was crossed by Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts believe that Albert Einstein may not even have the general relativity quality of the substance, which will raise the mass of the substance as the soil surface.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, was still determined to believe that Einstein did not repent, and the Swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with the so-called dark material which the surgeons discovered in the universe.
"The dark substance may be responsible for the anomaly, which may be found all around the Earth," says Adler.
From the existence of a dark substance, the world's motorists have only been informed for ten years.
Clearly, he has developed a gravitational force that can be observed by the effects of other fires.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light does not cause any damage or damage.
According to scientists, the entire mass of the universe is well aligned with the dark matter.
Exempted Travellers in Egypt
After ten days in the concentration of rapists, tourists gathered in Egypt were free again - strengthened by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The people of Sudan demanded more than a million euros of exchange fees.
He lost his life to six hostages in a robbery before he was released.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.

Freedoms for European tourists in the Sahara.
The Egyptian state television, Al-Arabia Arabic TV and Italian media were also included.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 TV scientists Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of free apology: "Our employees and other taxes have been released.
Now let's look at health conditions," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Roman citizen, as well as eight Egyptian explorers, are in the building and security of the Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of the Soviet expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
Further, there are cases of rape before the release of the bull: According to an Egyptian security officer, the bullies have already shown willingness to forgive the bull when the Sudanese army has miraculously killed sheep.
"The problem has been solved.
The prize was accepted," said the cleaning officer.
"If only it was about the transfer of taxes," when suddenly came the surprise.
The Sudanese soldiers shot six men at the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Friday, and arrested two of them.
The taxpayers demanded a six million euro of exchange rates from Germany; the money should be transferred to the German wife of one tax.
The "al-Maszri al-Jom" journal called on a German mediator to learn that the freeness of taxes is due to the concern of the people about their own buildings.
According to the report, female taxors are allowed free of charge after payment of the variable duty.
The men are kept until they find a safe escape route.

"Leaded to Humiliation" is the modern-day force.
He admitted in court that a woman had become a suicide victim because her grandfather had been raped for years.
Cornwall lives in Stitians, 57-year-old Michael Trerise spent six years in prison after he gave an eight-year-old witness about an attempted coup d'état.
The court found out that she had regularly bound her daughter, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and a week.
Trerise wrote in a statement: "I feel worthy of death."
It was agreed that Randle was a suicide victim at the age of 34 in his fourth home in the city of Plymouth, Mutley, on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes before the meetings while her mother worked in a wheelchair.
Trerise became his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwallt.
He's now transferred to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was found that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteerly at the National Trust Art Protection Agency, was subjected to two repeated rapes twice a week.
In 2006, Judge Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been in love with suffering and grief, said that her friends "have died emotionally" and "lost out of life".
In April 2007, her father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in the apartment of Plymouth.
He must've got you dressed up with a bag.
Mr. Randle's daughter's cousin, who wrote her testimony, "I've always bound and closed her eyes.
I didn't have sex.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're a strange fetish, and you're sure this was a shock to your victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unfortunate family girl ended up killing the victim.
But even more sobering is the fact that if you don't do this, the case may never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I pay attention to how Stephanie's parents thought she was affected by the crimes committed by you over the years.
If this hadn't happened, it would probably have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Important data loss officials have been placed under your charge
According to BBC reports, they are accused of breaking official secrets by the government bureaux who had certainly forgotten confidential documents in June.
The man was sent from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strict secret documents on a Waterlooba container.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the most serious case of poverty, and there is no doubt that there is a criminal prosecution.
Frank Gardner, a researcher appointed to the BBC Ministry of Defence, said that the move has taken a lot of place in Whitehall.
"It was thought that the Ministry of Defence and the government would handle the case as an internal case," she said.
The application which cannot be named has been filed under the law under point 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph refers to the storage of information.
The State prosecutor suggested that the charges against officials were represented by the Metropolitan Police because of the possible sensitive work of a man with regard to the Joint Committee on Communications.
The documents lost by it included confidential investigations relating to Al-Kaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
They were informed on Monday about the decision and then moved from home to an unknown place.
Housing bonds are paid to B&amp;B account
The United Kingdom housing associations can account for an account of over 80 million English pounds after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government has spent 14 billion points of interest on the protection of its members at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
This loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the shareholders, including 59 housing units.
According to Adrian Coles, President of the Association of Building Associations (BSA), that companies and their members must be paid.
At the end of the return of 14 billion important loans, it will take place after the return of Bradford &amp; Bingley's symbols.
However, in the course of the current year, interest rates can be applied to 700 financial companies using the loans.
The Financial Services Board confirmed to the BBC that they are also part of the 59 housing unit.
Unfortunately, the institutions that are still running around... must now pay the bills of those institutions that were less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that all companies need to be paid in such a way that the amount of the company's income is low, and companies share 18% of the costs among each other.
According to the Department of Finance, the amount of credit in 2009 amounts to 450 million points.
This means that companies need to be afraid of paying 81 million dollars for the first year.
Adrian Coles, head of the company's department, told BBC that the measure was unfair.
"It is desirable that institutions should pay for the accounts of less-preservative institutions which have left the housing market at any time during the restructuring of the housing market."
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since its operation began in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks in order to agree on how to protect housing companies and members from the significant amount of account," Cole added.
This year's end of September 2009 shall be 7 months from the end of March 2009.
In 2010, a full-year pension is to be paid, which can be even the current doubt.
Since the housing associations are self-helping organisations, without participation, members will eventually have to pay the account, either at higher fees or at lower rates after their contributions.
The price of milk rises by five pounds per litre
People in Jersey need to pay more for the milk.
Jersey’s parent company has announced that it will offer more than five pounds per litre of high-trafficking milk from a week.
This is the second increase since the increase of two pennies in February and after an examination by an advisory company.
The beneficiaries decide whether they will continue to increase the price to consumers.
Before the fall of February, the price of high-trading milk in Jersey was changed in 2002.
The former representative of Bangladesh was rejected in order to protect himself freely
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request for protection of former Parliamentary representative Sheikh Hasina, which means that they can be detained when they return to the country.
His lawyer said that the court had denied the protection of freedom in relation to the claim that 50 million tonnes were withdrawn from a businessman at the time of parliamentary representation (US$ 729,700).
This case is just one of the numerous allegations of corruption.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Ziaat was released this month.
Sheikh Hasina has to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, follows that the country's provisional government, supported by the military, will give her full freedom in advance.
According to the researchers, although they were conditionally free to go abroad for treatment, they are not clear from the conditions of the position of the free leg to protect their freedom when they return to the country.
Lawyers say he will now be brought before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court ruled that Sheikh Hasina's guardianship was not required, since he had been placed free of charge for a while and is taking part in foreign treatment," we knew from lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are going to fight against the decision of the Supreme Court."
According to the attorneys, it is therefore necessary to protect the state of freedom in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said that Sheikh Hasina was expected to be home after October 17th.
Then Tavaly was taken into custody that the interim government supported by the army took over power, but in June he was released from prison to be treated abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia are both members of the case against them.
Concerns about the Afghan Polio Protection Programme
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have been released from the recently organised anti-polo protection programme for Taliban forces.
In the past week, the UN has organised a six-year defence action.
However, it was said that for safety reasons they could not come to the children living in some parts of the southern Helmand and Kandahar.
According to an UN-wide survey, however, the Taliban have made a promise: they will not attack or stop the work of thousands of leading personnel.
BSKYB's entry into contact with ITV was rejected
BskyB's entry into force was rejected against the decision of the Competition Commission, which led to a reduction in its interest in mobile television in ITV.
The Competition Supreme Court ordered BSKYB to reduce its participation in ITV by less than 17.9% of 17.9%.
The Commission has previously concluded that BSkyB's participation would impede competition and would have an unfair impact on the company's ITV.
BSKYB purchased its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented the NTL - which has since been referred to Virginia Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Court announced that BSKYB’s share of VAT purchases would jeopardise the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Law Commission to initiate an investigation.
The director of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's control were all opposed to the purchase.
BSKYB felt that the reduction in its VAT share was required by a non-reasonably and disproportionate approval - especially in view of the fact that BSKYB had declared it to be a failure to exercise voting rights.
Further examination of the case of U.S. State Audits
The U.S. Supreme Court has appointed a special case for the investigation of the rescue of nine U.S. nationals in 2006.
The measure followed that the decision of the Governor-in-Office of the Judiciary on the case was criticised by the decisions of the Governors.
The prosecutor sentenced White House officers, lawmakers and former prime minister, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was conducted because it was feared that the state controls were being removed from political importance.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor will now examine whether the prosecutors who have been heard during the investigation have tried falsely to prevent justice.
"They have not yet examined and cleared serious allegations of possible crime," said Glenn Fine, the chief supervisor.
One of the main proposals was to name a special prosecutor who is in charge of the Witnesses' testimony.
The series started with nine state officials removed by the US Legal Court in December 2006.
In the meantime, they said that they had been forgiven for their poor performance.
However, it later came to the conclusion that there was nothing worse than that of many of their fellow Members by the rescue authorities, which led to the conclusion that political reciprocity was due to follow-up.
Some state inspectors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others were not willing to participate in the investigation of charges against the democratically elected family.
The U.S. government will conduct investigations and continue judicial proceedings on the basis of the government's trust.
They can be saved at any time, but they can't get away from their position on political grounds.
The head of the judicial board, Alberto Gonzales, has become the main target of attacks by the State for rescues and has finally disappeared.
A number of other officials of the judiciary have been granted exemption.
Gonzales, in his report to the chief supervisor, considered the role involved in the case to be "primary responsibility" for forgiveness, "dedicated" and "expected" itself from the process.
Other officials - including Karl Rove, former Bush assistant – argue that they did not have cooperation during the investigation.
Get the most out of the puzzle
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at Q Awards Awards for the epic heaven of "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer who will take over a special gold raise fee next week at London's holiday, he said, would hold recognition in high esteem.
The nine-minute, 50-minute walk of dal Meat Loaf in 1977, was a public show album titled.
The Coldplay received most of the sign for the time fees, which were listed in four categories.
Paul Rees, the principal editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some sounds that go beyond the time or the workings' limits, and "Bat Out Of Hell" like this."
The sound received by Jim Steinman required a lot of sound, and this was the sound Meat Loafé.
The song just started with a two-minute sound.
In 1979 it was reported as a minor, and the slaughter lists reached the 15th place.
However, the Meat Loaf album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the list for nearly nine years, and then more than 40 million examples have been provided.
Meat Loaf - a real name named Marvin Lee Aday - is currently struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003, he underwent surgery because of his heart condition, after he met at the stage.
In 2007, he had to say a few concerts because of his high blood pressure.
It was later found that a clean can be found in the voice.
An unknown city road that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of fans, circuits and other attachments. Some of them are known, others have performed their functions of practice.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-lived local residents would find it difficult to tell where to find Extra Place because they have never heard of it before.
The little street is in East Village, and it's on the north side of the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - the Bowery and the Second Street.
Kb. 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more similar to a dust cleaner than a main transport route.
There's no street leaves.
Usually it cannot be found on a standard map.
But there are miracles on the road.
There's, for example, Avalon Bay, the construction of the first street luxury buildings recently built.
He wants to book Extra Place again, and he wants to make sure that new buildings can come to his business and store on a cleaner way.
Among the miracles of the road are the long-dwelling neighbors here who were caught in the streets of the castle, that this was the only remnant from the past before environmental impacts.
However, it is not in the interest of the road owner, the city's maintenance and development department.
This month, at a meeting of the Land Government Management Committee, the city and the representatives of Avalon Bay made a proposal that the builder would buy the road.
However, the Commission would like to know better if the road remained in the city’s management and requested a new plan to be submitted next month, Mr. Susan Stetzer, head of the 3rd Government Board.
"There is a very small area already in the city's neighborhood, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its city," she said.
"So there can be proposals for the promotion and treatment of Avalon, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to rediscover the little road and want to stay with his neighbors. Some of them would use a coffee shop that the builder would probably give you an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first brought to public this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although the company wanted to use the road, she doesn't hesitate to use it.
"The Avalon Bay's main focus is to bring out this lost sinker and build a suitable public place," he said, in addition to proposing the purchase of the city.
Seth Donlin, head of the Building Guard Office, said the city would really like to sell the road and noted that the office was responsible for the development of buildings and not the management of them.
For a closer look, Bowery's image of Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say that in 1802 he received the name "old land" when Philip Minthorne had a large door divided between countless children, and no one was required for the short land area.
Punk-rock works closed in 2006, the CBGB's back door opened to Extra Place, and perhaps the most famous photo of the album "Rocket to Russia" was posted there.
"It was a great place," said Danny Fields to the Ramones manager who produced the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of eyes, clothes, clothes and pastry, and clothes and rags."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how he took East Village into his closet, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They think that its central office, whatever it is, must remain in the community's neighborhood.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare one, which is a city's virtually unchanged heritage and which must be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, a blog author called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" ("The Book of Sierras: A Fibrous Nustalgia for the process of the city's exit"), posted on his blog a part of the story about Extra Place, which appears in the article "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a small, small pocket that is still dark in the day, which is bound by rescuers and scraping bars, and where there are some news in the chambers."
The road, except for a few exceptions, looked the same with a few nights ago.
A pack crossed the street at the end of the road, to the back door, which led back to the CBGB, and now it belongs to a taller, more expensive dress shop.
It was graffiti in the woods, and an empty, 0,75 litrespalck was buried next to an abandoned, fresh paper.
Some passengers said they'd rarely get to the Extra Place, but they think it'd be the same.
Fields said that some of them are underestimating the current state of the road.
"I've spent my life in dark, dirty and uncomfortable places for more than a year," he said.
Discussion on bilingual education: Continued coverage of the English language environment
In this part of the course, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss their views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher and director of California's studies at the National Institute of Ocean Policy Research, is a writer of the book "Not as good as you think: Why is it necessary for high school education?".
It's not easy to get in the interest of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's education proposals are also included here.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish teachers get a degree of less probability than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome these differences in performance, Obama’s educational plan is explicitly supported - among other things - by "temporaneous bilingual education" for English students.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether the obligation to bilingual education, which places the emphasis on non-English school education, lies at the interest of large performance differences.
Take, for example, the general school of the Six Street Prep contract in Los Angeles to the east.
Most of the school students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one third of the students — many of whom had recently arrived — learned English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders have achieved excellent results in the 2008 state math study.
It is similar to amazing that 93% of the fourth graders have performed excellently in the English language and office.
This incredible performance was not valued by the instrument that Obama would share.
Sixth Street places the volume for the repetition, practice, continuous assessment of the equipment and the avoidance of noise.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's education principle is "full-scale integration" into the language environment of English-learning students.
The main method of inclusion is the unique use of English at the level of teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: "We have been very successful in getting someone into a classroom, not realizing who was the student who came back from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works," he said, "we work."
Will Obama set the following example for other, significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-learning schools such as Six Street Prep?
The results obtained by school should be understood to make the choice, but because of their own education policy (the National Educational Associations support bilingual education) and because you choose yourself from bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's response.
Although it was agreed that immigrants should learn English, Obama had recently expressed his appreciation for the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "extremely English" bill.
Instead, she said, "They should be able to speak Spanish to their children."
If Obama really wanted to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that they operate instead of looking at and buying them.
The price of oil fell on the sea due to the concerns of the economy
On the weekend, the oil spills are due to concerns, according to the American Financial Market Rescue Plan, that will not be able to compensate the economy.
Seven percent of the profits are returned to New York's Trade Exchange for $99.80 before the end of the year.
Prices fell by more than 20 dollars every week.
In the last two weeks, the stock market has won the Wall Street financial crisis and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached US$ 145.29 per tonne in July, at the beginning of this month they would return almost $90 per tonne before the effects of the unverified financial markets would have been overhauled.
On Monday, concern was again aroused by investors even after the Congress' leaders announced that they had managed to unite on the weekend with economic rescue action, which is the largest in the history.
The news has been filled with concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for long.
As the most recent event of the emerging crisis, the Citigroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation bank account, which was announced by the government on Monday.
In time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have established the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to the Barclays Capital analysts, the results of the two-week bilateral agreements "it seems that rescue has not been able to restore the trade interest of Tzotzsdei."
As the economic situation deteriorates, goods - for example oil demand may decline.

Recorded by the team with your second quarter
After more than eight seasons ago he spent more time in the middle of Jets than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in the defense end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he saw the second four of you release on Friday, when Jets turned out to be a sensory game without a point.
"I've never seen this before," said Ellis.
After your second quarter, the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was completely in line with the single, dark skies.
Brett Fabre, a quarterback 12-star touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This was a perfect step forward for a Sunday, during which their outstanding cooperation continued significantly.
Favre gave two more touchdown pass to Coles in this four of you, among others, when two cornerbacks later died 10 seconds before the end of the quarter.
"I didn't regret the fatigue," Fabre said about all the pass he gave to Coles.
"If you're a good player.
We've still been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were shot, the defense stopped the Cardinal's director, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who is in the cornerback position, got a bad shower, and returned with 32 yards, which he touched down.
Eric Smith, a safe player got into another passport and got his bat.
David Bowens, the linebacker was able to pull the trigger from Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the game.
However, when Cardinals lost his gun before the end at 10 seconds, and Jets got it, Jay Feely wore a 20-year-old dress, thus setting the result of 30.0.
This was the best result that Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When they asked Jet's teacher Eric Mangin to mark the highlight of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When she was told that she was both -- in your third quarter, the Cardinals got 21 points, that Jets didn't get one -- Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed your second quarter much better than the third.
We've got a lot of points in a short time."
Gebrselassie has adopted its own world order
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many of the best ever-lived average and long-time runners were held in Berlin when he adopted his world record on Friday morning. He was the first one to fly within 2 hours.
In the comfortable pool, during 2:03:59, Gebrselassie won 27 second minutes in the previous result of 2:04:26, which was common in Berlin.
For 35 years, the 26th World War II of Gebrselassie has been established in a number of areas, ranging from 1500 metres to Marathon level, or from the world record.
Over the past month, Gebrselassie has left the Beijing Olympic Marathon, which, on the other hand, has proved too careful - that air pollution continues to cause asthmatic problems.
He's been admitted to Berlin's maraton instead.
Among almost perfect conditions - at the start of the day, at 9 °C, and at the end of 13 °C - Gebrselassie won at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon did not start earlier, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to the longest distances, the marathon record has decreased over two minutes in your last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 at 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After winning Sunday, Gebrselasse told the reporters that two weeks ago her legs were broken and she couldn't teach for two weeks.
Of course, he was refreshed during the exercise period and did not get involved.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselasse to the reporters.
"All made perfect.
A week ago I started teaching again, and today I had doubts, but it was all right."
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East-African Rivalry - as he says he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoiding many world-class marathons, leaving off on track as if he were running on a train, and placing world records on the front of the competition.
However, this criticism almost reduces the magnitude of Gebrselassie in the long run.
Gebrselassie got the top point at 1:02:04 on Sunday with four Kenyan amraptors.
Two live Kenyan runners, James Kambai and Charles Kamath gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were shot.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the target, Gebrselassie left Kambai with a last sprint, which reached its goal at 2:05:36, at least 5 minutes.
Kamathi entered on Wednesday at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, the birth of the Castra Praetoria, Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, has closed the year worth paying attention to the seventh most, with the victory of 2:19:19.
The World Cup is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25 p.m.
In the past, 36-year-old Mikitenko has won the success of the London Maraton at 2:24:14.
He was unable to take part in the persecution of the Beijing Olympics, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he was five minutes older than one. This was the third marathon trip he took part.
With accurate calculation, he won the competition: he first allowed the Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance a four major group and led to significant leadership, then after 30 km.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magrasa was second in time at 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop was third in result at 2:25:01.
A different city, the height and try of the black
In the Greater Islands - some miles away from everything that stars, sounds and powers - build a quiet little town where the height of the African life is high and bungalow.
Eatonville, the first clean black city to be integrated into the country, which was home to Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five roofs, three croquet floors, 300 inner leather, 300 good washers, many caves and two schools, without prison."
Now it's breakfast.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the Zora festival this year. The Eatonville event is held in honor of Harlem Renessan's most famous female writer, Hurston.
However, in many respects it has been described as a city of tourism - which also plays a role in the Florid roadmap published by the Association Council of Ministers.
Just as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote in Florida, urban blacks were often not willing to share real thoughts with white people who "know us so little that they don't know what they're going to do."
Even during the year when the black president, Barack Obama opened his session on the issue of race, there are many mistrust about the views of foreigners.
"We're very concerned about how to tell our story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and was a member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville's been winning for a long time, and the fight is a paradox.
The historical significance of black exposure is once a model, while at least 2400 major communities where poverty indicators reach the national average level.
Partly an office complex, and part as a result of American slave labor, sometimes looked down on, sometimes for treasures, southern, urban, black culture, which flourishes at the price of the fruit trees.
It's not surprising that the locals are proud and protective at once.
The image created by Eatonville has been important since Zora (who is everyone called Hurston).
In the books of the honest, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he showed his parents the world.
The Florida road book changed five paragraphs to the city, which is located along the 17th road. This road leads from the center of Florida long ago forgotten the history of the blacks and the human dramas to one location.
Hurston, who was courageous in life and in the office, even the doppelganger, introduced his readings into the first city mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke's business, and then entered the more reliable spheres.
He wrote: "We're better able to find the modern public school on the inside with a white sage, well-welled shoes and toys that Howard Miller is worried about, although he can barely write and read."
He mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "can buy all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in the temporary hotels."
So in a few words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with his autonomy, but at the same time with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Of course Fodor's travel book showed otherwise.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora said things like they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters.
He added, "Some people don't like this."
Hurston is still remembered here as the student, especially who often visited home after his family moved to the Florida Jacksonville.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston entered the city, he usually came to a thriving Chevrolet, a cigarette, and a long way into a city where people are still proud of their decent behavior.
Most of the people were shocked, Franklin said, but many people were interested.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, looking at Sabelia's tower, where Hurston was most likely crucified, he added, "It's never been too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer released.
He seemed to have forgotten about Eatonville with much of the world.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes's court, and the only black woman at the Barnard University in the 1920s, he died in an accident in the Florida Fort Pierce, where he had lived before.
There were no significant reminders or great public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think you understood how much you have enriched the world or what you have left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book "Borrowing in Switzerland" published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange wanted to build a five-way street through the city, instead of the second capital, Kennedy, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanded Orlando has already entered the city’s quiet border with Interstate 4 cars connecting the States.
The proposal came when Eatonville was even stopped after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has ended the Community's relatively idyllic ejaculation.
In the 1950 ’ s, wars related to fads were fought against the community.
"A group of white boys came over in the corner, and they threw candles on the road with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They pulled a Greek girl out of a car."
In a letter to the "The Orlando Sentinel" page in 1955, Hurston questioned his decision to ensure the strong integration of the Supreme Court. He stated in a decision entitled "Brown v. Board of Education" that "is no longer hurt, as long as it does not respect my species."
People today say that school disaggregation was so positive in some respects that it weakened the attitudes of the Eatonvilles and undermines the confidence of young people.
"The black children used to kill them - I remember - the man killed his teacher in the morning and in the evening" - said N. Y. Nathari, Ella Dinkins' daughter, director of the non-profit organization called "Look at Meg Eatonville Community".
"It lasted until the students and teachers were born together," she added.
"We didn't kill our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many others in the promotion of Zora Neale Hurston - in black writing, movies and art, who have grown up in the premises, as he did, such as the following: "How can anyone escape from the enjoyment of my society?
That's unacceptable to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker slipped into Hurston's secret, and began fighting to return her name.
Five years later, the bookstores were set up in Poland by Robert E. Hemenway, a well-known Hurston, who once again appeared among American examples.
The construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter came back to its center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's former neighbor was considered a survivor.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show what would ruin its way to the main street.
More than a thousand fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then many will return to the festival every January.
A few years later, he stopped his construction proposal.
"As a result of the merger of the capital, the community has been re-enacted at full speed, which means real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd just said, "He just saved Eatonville."
The success of the construction project has helped to change the image created by the city itself.
A greater number of people from outside the city were present, such as Dr. Rachelle Munson, who started going to church in 1993 and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville entered the national historical record in 1998.
In 2006, he opened a new, unique book called Hurston, the new and beautiful Kennedy library.
Eatonville is still alive in Florida: it is not only ten km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like it's like a foreign-town attachment during the summer rains; it's as small as it was when 27 black families were established in the 1880s.
(This is 90% black.)
They still take care of foreigners who come here looking for Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, which is designed by a white man and which is working on the ground - do not have to be photographed.
In Eatonville, many - among others, self-esteem Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to our lives - fear that they will be scared of their different communities.
And yet, as Hurston's festival became more and more violent, the height of the city grew.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: amazing, problems and not better, not worse, not worse, just like the same mountains, creative, shy, confused and frustrated, like other species and ethnic groups in America.
A sincere civil engagement is made for Franklin's grandson, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after high school to work with the local government or the police, which they consider to be available for help.
And it seems that young people have also learned to mark Eatonville properly, such as 11-year-old Winter Park's poet: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of the people who just walk here think this city has nothing to do with others," said Alondra Kenon recently one Sunday after the ostracism.
"But if someone stops and takes a little time to get to know the story, it's a very nice city."
We're all talking about money in New York.
Nothing's changed at the top.
If tourists don't care about the news clubs and powerful television fans in Times Square, I wouldn't notice they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never come to realize that the wine-growing, soft-rooted offices are the heads of bankers and venture managers who hold New York in power since 1929 live the worst days.
The trainers are still carrying out hundreds of tea cars on the vehicles, transporting muffinally sealed plates to the morning talks.
Even in Spain, decent men are still hanging out among the majority of the houses, as human sisters, with a pair of shoes that are quite similar to those of theirs.
The office workers are still in line for their breakfast breakfast on the train, and still it is impossible to get a taxi on Sunday between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis until I got to the end of the day, despite all the alarming news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I planned to do this on a Sunday vacation at the local head of the JP Morgan Chase bank, but I've been standing in front of 20 people.
Not on the bank account where money can be bought or paid, but on the customer service door, where older clients have a checkout, tourists are asking for an adjustment to Macy's shop and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me - I knew about Start later, the "ordered" banker - as well as the fates were in line like me.
However, unlike me, they have already borrowed their money from smaller banks located in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was taken out of so-called savings banks (which are similar to housing bonds), credit bonds, and small stock funds that operate only in one state and are treated as a permanent family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks went silent.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a 327 billion-dollar bank has been under stress, and when New Yorkers returned on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, sought a bank purchase of $440 billion in savings.
The office and business workers in front of me, half of them transferred their money to a bank that appeared to be safe escapes from the bank, which is the most capital injection in the Wall Street.
The simple New Yorkers have become experts in money in the past few weeks.
A woman in a local Chinese store phoned to talk about Lehman Brothers' bank and his powerful headmaster, Dick Full, as if he had been complaining to a funny colleague.
And Lyn, a five-year-old housekeeper, has changed the subject of my apartment, not of Brad and Angelina now, nor of my food delivery, as we used to do.
He told me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my saved money in financial market tools.
I changed, you didn't risk it."
Moslem tears have been performed while Austria is on the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-hand Ostrak Freedom Party, and Philip Dewinter, from the Belgian Right-Belga Party, from the Vlaams Belang, participated in a meeting in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, on Thursday, which presented the organization called "The Watch for the Implementation of Islam Ellen".
Marks followed by transport tables were drawn up and painted in red lines.
According to the police, the best-beings of the left-hand side are responsible for explaining to the Austrian Muslims the same thing happened at the end of the week when the left-hand side parties have made significant progress in the national parliament elections.
More than 90 complaints were made in the Trauni cemetery near Linz, sometimes Friday night and this morning.
Followers of Jewish symbols with paintings, such as David’s star, were painted in a number of poems, but according to researchers, they simply tried to conceal the noble origins that were rooted in the hatred of Muslims.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in some way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that "they were personally ordered" after hearing the complaint that occurred shortly before the end of Ramadan in the month of Muslim worship.
At the same time, Austria has a climate-recognition survey following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political dimension is better marked.
The two sides of the left hand side, which had just got 30% votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Association of Austria for a strong anti-refoulement law, and some of their slogans were joined by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Free Party, who receives more than 18% of the votes, has also completed the campaign against headphones and bullies, and has completed its campaign against Islam-related food.
The party spoke of "European brotherhood" in its final, peaceful assembly, which can prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mines and mines in view of the political symbols of their implementation in the Austrian and European processes.
In view of the direct results obtained after the elections of the best winner, the change was thanks to a large proportion of young people who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter was banned from a foreign trip
Gary Glitter, a known rock star for strengthening the children's lives, has been banned by the court from visiting France and Spain.
The judges then decided to cancel Glitter for six months to inform the supervisory authorities of his intention to travel across France to Spain.
The border police received a ban on the journey after giving evidence of the court's judgement against Glitter against children.
Glitter, a real name for Paul Gadd, did not participate in the field Ashford Magistrate but represented the Corker Binning attorney.
A judge said: "On 25 September, the county police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court on 25 March to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain.
"Paul Gadd doesn't come personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities about the purpose of foreign travel, as this is required by the law on participants in the register of sexual offenders.
It shall inform the authorities if it is intended to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also necessary to notify the police at least seven days before the proposed refusal.
Where it does not notify the authorities, they may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The police told me they didn't want Glitter to be involved in specific cases and to talk about his condition.
We learned from the district police spokesman: "The rural police will do everything in the protection of the children within the country and abroad.
"Our opinion is that it is easier to control someone if he does not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system here that enables us to deal more effectively with potential risks.
"The most important task of the county police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continue to monitor the behaviour of the persons involved in registering sexual crimes and living in the rest of the world to minimize the possible risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a 10-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to transfer to a London-based machine.
However, she said she felt bad, and she didn't want to fly to London.
The territorial authorities did not permit the inspection, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities did not allow them to enter the country at all, so they returned to Bangkok, where officials of the Land Police and the Immigration Service insisted that they return to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, Heathrow arrived at the 3rd airport and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker did not go to the law of the stateless London,uxbridge, because, at the request of Scotland Yard, he was admitted to a court hearing in order to register the perpetrators of sexual crime.
Glitter had spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in order to bring out photographs of children forced into the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, a local government official, calmed down and gladly admitted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't want to make photos on the stage because I want to show the artist on my personal page" Günther Bauer Photo artist
There's no smoke, no fuds, no dancing.
From the Grandmaster's body of flamenco, the action without any motive: to get to know the faces of the dancers on the weekend.
From time to time, the artist.
On the other hand, the weekend man.
And these two pages can't be cut apart, except at the friendly, away from the public at moments when we can afford a personal movement, we can capture the depth of a person's perspective, or we can rejoice in the beauty of an artist who is ready to move to the stage, but expressive hand.
In a photo series called Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the German theatre of musicians, dancers and guitars is accompanied by a small-known weekly page by teachers.
The photos show the private iconography of the flamenco from different faces.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Film Festival, "the flamenco day shows the international significance of increasing day by day" - says the author, in addition to the fact that the flamenco-people "can be anyone since the images were seen in a closer view that these images are not typical of art.
These people on the street are artists who are capable of bringing suffering, grief, shame to your heart... and of ruining the public.
At the same time, color photography is not useful for attracting their personality.
Their personality and character live mostly on their own.
I'd like to create a healthy atmosphere that makes it possible for me to enjoy the personality of the great flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival was held on a long way from Bauer in 1997, during which portraits of flamenco songs, guitars and dancers were produced with a light camera.
These portraits feature classical photography thanks to the camera and the theme selection.
However, the use of various stylistic instruments has been interrupted by the design of the traditional image and modernity. The following thought reflects Bauer's idea of the flamencore: "This is a traditional music, however, which changes every day and is always amazing."
It's not dance, it's not music or music itself, it's much more like the artist's personality, it's a characteristic of the public.
In the days of El Fotomat Gallery, the driving force of events is to seek to meet with the essentials of art, which can be seen through the sensation, the existence and the display.
The famous figures of flamenco, among others Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, feature this collection of photos that will be shown in six art.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, which soon produced an album corresponding to the portraits presented in the exhibition.
Bauer spent two years in the "SportARTProject" series without suffering for the athlete.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is somewhat different from this, the artist adds: "I love to take people into the light, to know them and to enter into their lives for a longer or shorter time.
I think the photo is the best way to work on the portrait.
You're meeting people, you're meeting people with personalities that sometimes you don't even know, or who just take a few minutes to take a photo.
But in spite of these circumstances, I always want to carry out my imagination as a photo.
The exhibition with the title Flamenco-people, selected from the short flamenco portrait, will be held in El Fotomata Gallery with Alameda de Herculess, which will be held under the 20th floor of El Fotomata until October 16.
Vargas Llosa says the rain that works, "all wake up"
The scene and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also proud of his new regalia. The head of the empire is a writer nationalist, Roger Casamant, who has also bought Congo and Amazon for nine years.
The Irodalmi Nobel Prize was also an opportunity writer at the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday that his current work "complete maturity" and "every sign shows that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and I hope I'll make it to the end" - with these words, he closed his presentation at the festival of opinions and opinions adopted by four-day writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct and visitors.
"The City and the Dogs" was one of the greatest participants in the office's celebration, and it also changed its hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award, which was voted by participants, an old edition of Dickens "Our Common Friend".
Félix Romeo welcomed the audience as soon as possible. He told the audience about the hour during which the Peruvian writer was able to remember and give a great dose of humor how it was made out of the unique calendar of his suffering and his desire to live; how he was moved by the written methods of Ilehathian, the modest documentation, many improvements and re-writing; how he was able to write the works of Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories are being built.
The Latin American king acknowledged that it was impossible to see or to show whether the books were changing our lives, but he added: "I don't think the experience of the office is a waste of fun or pleasure," because it has an impact on people and thinking, so he asked the writers not to let them down and act on their responsibilities.
As a result of the current season, Pozoblanco is less likely to remain in the wild.
Traditionally, the horse bivalve arranged for the Pozoblanco celebrations was removed from the workshop yesterday before noon after the weary horse breeders found the area of the arena to be unusable.
As a result, the committee agreed with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, will remain with the bikavia.
However, the time-limits were based on the holiday series, since two of the three rules could not be maintained.
Sombaton was left with the second bikavia because of the famine.
The leading players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblancó were fighting.
That's how it was held on Friday.
The winner Daniel Luque became a three-fold trophies home. After the final and aesthetic struggle, he was dragged around.
At the same time, Alejandro Talavante obtained a number of recognition and trophies on the same day, but he was more grateful to the public than to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who was less involved in raising the name of the Los Llanos Arena.
After the second round of relief, most of the public managed to get out of the camp.
In the factory, a two-ton train carrying a two-ton train was trying to escape road control
It's been four hours five minutes.
The territory of the Bask Field Police is controlled by the Government of Armenia (Láva).
The authority shall stop a train which is on its second journey, and the passengers shall try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of lead, wasn't obvious at the same time.
The investigators were arrested, and one, a 28-year-old man was arrested, and A.A. J. was identified - announced by the Basque government to the Northern Ostalia.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and fraud.
The case took place in the administrative area of Arminun where the employees of the Ålavai Commercial Supervision conducted a marketing inspection at the N-1 car station.
When they wanted to stop the train, the driver refused the permit, gave the gas without delay, and then left the control station.
The inspectors were taken into a wheelchair, then a few miles away from the vehicle stop, and their passengers moved from the car park to a forest area.
The Bask Regional Police finally caught one of them, and after examining Iveco Daily's truck, it received its shipment of 2178 kilograms.
The rear parts of the vehicle were carried out by the police authorities in order to carry out further examinations and detect the drug.
In addition, it was established during the verification that the vehicle’s false system sheet does not match the data contained in the vehicle’s records, and therefore the procedure was also initiated for the production of cokeheads against the arrested.
The BASK Regional Police will continue the investigation aimed at partly at the detention of the other suspect who, as we have already mentioned, escaped from his car accident, and on the other hand, to determine the origin of the drug in question.
The 28-year-old accused A. A. J. was sent to the police to conduct the necessary hearings, and then the judicial measures began within a few hours.
Heather Locklear has been arrested as a result of the effects of the medicine
Heather Locklear was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) for taking the medicine.
According to one observer, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito - a spokesman for the People's magazine of California.
According to the observer, about 16 hours a.m. Locklear "pressed the gas slowly, pushed the engine forward, forward and back, and tried to stop the parking lot several times in the afternoon."
Not much later, the viewer who probably didn't recognize the film first saw Locklear standing in a nearby car park and getting out of the car.
He also informed the police 'cause it was "for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the dancer was sitting in his car, which had partially reduced the traffic of the car.
"It seemed closed," which is why the drivers were taken to a specialized centre for drug and alcohol research.
According to a police spokesman, the dancer was a co-operater and the alcohol consumption was immediately eliminated. He also said that he was under the influence of Locklear based on the first pressure of the cleaners.
Lockleart was arrested and charged with conduct taking place under unidentified conditions. About 19 hours he was transferred to the local prison, where he was placed in a few hours later.
Locklear came out two months ago from an arisonary scenario where he was treated with stress and depression.
Llamazares lifts its IU (United Bald) analogue federation to take action in Silva
Gaspar Llamazares, the head of the IU and the representative of the United Balbald, said today that the regional federation of the poor will make a decision on the issue of Youth and Sport Council of Sevillai, Francisco Manuel Silva.
"I am a federalist in all these matters, and this evidence is part of the influence of the Andalusian organisation," Llamazares pointed out in the procedure to be applied by the party to the Sevillai City Council.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed that when addressing possible irregularities by Silva, "visibility" should be kept in mind: "The IU has always been conveyed to silence, as long as the cases of such signs are as transparent as possible."
He added that part of the training was "the strict ethical code in case of use."
"Low blood", "Garci Epicosal alcohol"
Benito Pérez Galdós National Episcopals was an artist named José Luis Garcit, who is a famous Frenchman in the blood of the Spaniards, who, with a budget of about 15 million euros, is the biggest filmmaker in the world.
According to this, the director has always wanted to illustrate the amazing human nature and social analysis of his famous royal art. All today in the film show, Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría told Garci about the popular audience from the movies.
More than two and a half hours of May's blood will be shown in the music on Friday, and then the Telemedrid Miniature will take four hours in the area beyond.
José Luis Garci, the great miracle of Galdós' office has fulfilled his early childhood dream with this marketing. Thanks to Esperanza Aguirré, he has been confident three years ago from Madrid Tartomány to prepare a film for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events of May 2nd. Garci has accepted the invitation under this condition if the basis of the story can be given by the National Episcopalians.
A total of 15 million budgets were funded by the Madrid Autonom Tartom, and Garci had a special opportunity: it could show "the forgotten Spaniards who were led by the wrong behaviour, as the struggle continued for independence led to a strong remnant of the country's VII. Ferdinand's rule."
The director also expressed his regret that he could not count more than twice the budget of Alatriste or Goya's ghost budget of May's blood. Thus, he had to leave some of the features of the driving book, which - like many other times - are listed together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of the Rehabilitation went on to his usual working mode, taking up with the scenes that he had already started before the sale. Casting wasn't because Garci thinks it's a "measuring" and because, as he said, "the part of the organization's skill goes into the theater and music, so we can find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
More colours of the Mayan blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, were not first recorded.
Garci - who has four Oscar marks and an Oscar watch - believes that the time of the Spanish Presidency in front of the Hollywood Academy is marked by the Mayan blood, the Seven French billiards and one of the most popular Vak's young generation of Spanish music, said: "That should be shown below."
Garci doesn't count on fees with this movie.
"At first you think you're working for the last time, and you'll realize that only happiness counts, and then you'll be happy when you're ready for another movie," says Garci 30 years of professional experience behind.
Isabel Bayón forgets the life and art of the sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillee flamenco dancer is remembered as a sevillei dancer.
Carmen Törtola Ferrer, a father of Catalans (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalus (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in Triana and moved to London at the age of three.
He was a free dance artist and an expert in Eastern dances.
He fought for women's equality during his dynamic life, whether Isodora Duncan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the burning movement of women's freedom of movement.
In the war, dancing and esthetic revolution broke out in Europe, his life was ruined by Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa, who suggested that Tortoola, who was really impressed by his personality."
The flamenco dancer said to the following: "It's not our goal to tell the story of life, it's our passion.
The title of the dancers was remembered by the flamenco style.
For example, from "pillango dance" to Guaji, or "kijio dance" to "tongo dance".
"Serious dance and others think it's also my style," he says.
The light of the presentation is two outstanding instruments: Miguel Poveda is now singing with Isabel again after the Open Door; and Matilda Coral, who wanted to work with an earlier teacher in this case.
"Matilde produces the oldest Tortola, the older lady.
I'm glad he said yes to the request, very nice to go to the bar. "
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Ariaga songs are played by musicians and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pájaro is a musical song, Rafa El Viola wedding, and Juanfra Juárez is playing a permanent character with love.
In most cases, it also shows the life of a woman who lives in London, but also brings Europe into Europe, and it is still far from home, including India, the United States or Italy.
"That's why I'd like to remind her of her, because her personality had a great impact on herself at the time, but today she doesn't know and she still appreciates her work," says Bayon.
The show starts at Lope de Vega's theater tonight at 20 o'clock 30 o'clock.
Triennium is also shown at the end of "A fresh married wedding holiday"
The first illustrated release of a fresh married loan will be at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married to Zenobia. The program series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) is part of the program series organized by the Andalus Regional Cultural Committee for the fifth anniversary of the award of the Irodalmi Nobel Prize and the death of both of them.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are closed to the new release of the above-mentioned work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial and the exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiméne: The Light Bear". The exhibition opened in May and opened several analus provinces and, according to plans, visited New York at the time of the International Congress.
The Andalus Regional Cultural Committee has taken up eight hundred examples from Perdo Taberero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso from a fresh married loan to promote one of the most advanced Andalusian debts.
Without Paul Newman, it's not that exciting America.
"God sometimes created perfect humans.
Paul Newman was like that."
The event comes from the actress Sally Field, who works with Newman in the movie called the Censorship Victims, and celebrates the surprise and impotence that Newman's death has caused in American music and throughout America.
And how hard he got Oscart.
By way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013,
and he was suddenly ill,
But that's how everyone arranged his death.
"Sometimes our feelings of incompetence are expressed in words, and I now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford among ease, "he saw my life better and this country."
No one was afraid that they might get bored or get over it.
One of the heroes of music and home has survived in a particularly dark period, which has led to fear of terrorism and market forces, American self-assessment and the quest for duality.
When such difficult times come and many are easy to lose and there are very few people we can look at, then there is no need for Luis Cernudán to be surprised by Paul Newmant.
In the eyes of people, he has actually tested the beauty and justice of the payroll.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and was a defender of lost and won cases, starting from the anti-drug base established in the memory of his first-born son who died in drug trafficking until the establishment of the biofood market in the home.
There was a real gift for a country that could hardly survive in the culture of suicide.
My first miracle was that of buying Hollywood all over the world without looking at the nations and the origins.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, is not a man, but a bear died with him.
Another English, Oscar loan Sam Mendes stated that his joint work with Newman clearly indicated his point of view.
Russell Crowe, who came from Australia, named himself the greatest fan of Newman's.
"He made a lot of money for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who want to follow Paul Newman's life-style today: they need dignity and privacy away from serious and camera.
It's not always easy if it's at all possible with our media today.
There's still someone who's trying and Paul Newman's example.
Once he left, but after five years of faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward, he would certainly have been a number of times more likely to be unfaithful.
"Why did one of the other have hamburgers waiting for the cold meat at home?" he smiled.
As high as it may be, her daughters on earth are also regional, which is not very common in America.
"Not one of all the constructions was as high as the faithful man, the loving father, the caring grandpa and the generous human being," they say.
The path of the Madridian Olympics
Indeed, many dream a Madrid Olympic, and after 2012 failed, it may be from 2016.
But I'm asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we get out of yesterday's race, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect race, but I think it was the worst of many I've ever had.
Dissensitivity was a sign, and if I had to be evaluated once and I would be the researcher, of course, the result would be obvious.
Well, let's get out of here and start at the beginning.
Immigrants began to cross the line, so they had to come earlier.
This isn't a problem in itself, but if you're going sooner, you get everything at least at least once (including the chip, which prevents you from standing in the next row).
Well, that's not what happened.
For the first time only the number was passed (first misunderstanding, only to be there soon) and (after the normal ordering), which was only S-pole (second misunderstanding because I have XL-size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or have they decided that because of the crisis, they're going to fuck with their mother and they're just taking smaller, smaller poles?
But all these things are still falling apart like they happened on the day of the race.
In addition to going there in the early days of the storm, the stand on the line was 15 minutes from arrival, and even the rear door had to be shut down.
The waiting period continued for 35 minutes, which is unlikely for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't given up on the back.
In addition, the rain has made more than 40 minutes to wait, which has been adjusted by population and state-of-the-art testing.
I think tomorrow we'll get a safe deposit box at 500, and some of us, including ourselves, don't get our location by real time.
If you were to ask me about the perfect racer, it wouldn't naturally come to my mind.
I think we can continue the dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Search for Microsoft (virtual) reception
At the MIT Distinction Technology Conference, Microsoft has shown the development of a new representative and human interaction system, a type - not too intelligent - capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or a vehicle operating in Microsoft, the company's territory) on the basis of the information available from the conversation.
This "receptive" camera and a form and facial recognition system enables you to recognize how many are in the room, who they are, also notice how they wear their clothes - further hear and understand their key words.
In addition, he can group the present on the basis of the discussions.
The video presented by the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company talking to her and does not apply to the company.
He asks if he's coming to visit someone and he's gonna make sure he's ready for his help soon.
It's all blue with no big picture.
That's amazing.
But of course it's the next song.
Currently, the company's most important thing is to develop a new version of the Windows operating system, for example.
Many have complained this week that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain smaller software.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were to run instead of the many business sites they needed, the machines would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, it's already something.
They found the Spanish flag, pointing out that in all new versions Microsoft has added functions and extracts to Windows.
The change of direction will take place.
Microsoft's right, the operating system is going back and forth, and you're the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I joined the idea that Google had taken the first step towards becoming Windows's competitor.
Many have found that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, since I cannot be a part of the hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to his mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the operating system must be calculated "with death", not absolute, but relatively.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
We only connect the computer to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more time spent on browsing than we spent in the open world.
What, then, is most of the applications that are associated with the system?
The smaller times.
And Windows 7 is smaller, it needs to be smaller than Eastan.
It's less difficult, less literate, less blocked.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services more online and eventually to make an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
At the beginning of this month, I prepared this photo in a company designed for Microsoft users in Redmond.
The driver automatically tells them a poster, using the company's browser. "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google for online browsing.
In the past week, they have also announced the deletion of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of the year, more than in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try with Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone's still working as a computer.
But the cut, unless Android and iPhone are already on the market, is going to ruin business anyway.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was done by Pablo Picasso at Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick in the Games, and Al Pacino in the Francis Ford Coppola Centre, and this is also one of the basics of the outdoor gay shopping company.
And if we're already on the list of specialties, we can even overlook the peaceful figure of the heavy burden of the Vandor circle.
But what are we talking about?
It's about "tank" as the English people call it, but not one of them can't compete with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
For the first time, because of the elegant name - although only friends are mentioned as "Marcel" - which the sport can thank for, according to legend, was named by Marcel Cerdan's girlfriend, Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent pasturage, unisex rule, his personal emblem and the small (almost known) bell ring are also among his competitors. These are also included in the most prominent models in the pool.
But the Belgian company's not just making tanks.
The sports tops, retro boxers, cassettes, quays, sailboats, submarines, ministors - and we could still cross - are all among the company's products.
And all of them belong to the category of comfortable accommodations,
Although it's sad that they must be treated as inferiors.
That's too good.
"I want to be a young mother; everything that's going to happen to my father."
He's very much like his brother, but he's been able to make himself.
Monica Cruz is small and small, but she's full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of the theatre.
For Monica, the modeling gives more meaning than some beautiful and beautiful girl gives the name to something.
It was present in the promotion of Mango's new Paris branch, as well as in the transmission of the most important divities sponsored by the Spanish company.
I'll take it out of your misery and pride.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We show Mango's new collection of consciences that we have designed with my brother, Penelope, and we are also involved in the publication of the second Mango Fashion Awards and the ceremony for the honor of Valentino in the Opera.
It's pretty hot day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is the fourth season of Mango.
We both love the music of the 50s and the 60s, and we've got a lot of stuff out there.
And then, many times I'm just going to the city and watching women dress how they change and pick up their clothes - this is one of my favorite times.
You're also working as a dancer, a dancer and a comedian.
I think that's what I think, but at the end of it, it's all three things, because there's a lot of them together.
I've been interested in clothes since I was a little girl. I've been waiting for them to go to my grandmother, and I've got them in my grandpa's clothes.
Well, it was you in Canada, almost got up with a video park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
You know what dancers we want to figure out our own style for the hours and the attempts to make us feel good when we look at it.
And in her role as a dancer, you're really the same with your role when you get the mark.
You see, it's all about everything, and I respect all of its designers and experts.
You've recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women are really at the same time, they're already quite experienced and they're making fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't work.
I've been doing what I like since I was a kid, and that's been a lot of fun.
And you want to be mom or not?
Of course, I know I'm a mother because I was born into this woman, and I'd like to be a young mother, and I don't want to leave this at all.
And whatever happens to your stepfather, it's all about who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's take a few words about the mosir, and you've probably run more movies that haven't been shown yet.
I'm sure, and I'm just waiting for them to come out.
I started at the theater, I'm very impatient and impatient, I want everything right now, but I know it's impossible.
I'm almost waiting for them to show the last hour and the seek for Christ's voice.
I'm curious what you're saying to them...
Well, if I know that, you've spent a few days arguing with your cousin, Naomi Campbell.
Well, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the run as a model.
I know Naomi Campbell for a long time and just invited her to a well-being theatre in London, which she arranged for her own organization called for a better world. I chose two my own Mango collection.
People don't even know how nice Naomi is.
There's so much to be done about, so I know, and I can make sure that the side isn't right.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked for the show show for German case, but if he wanted me to stand up, I'll do it.
If women in the third world run the bridge, I don't know how impossible it is.
The following lead drivers will be obliged to call "Allocock"
The Ministry of the Interior would be obliged to establish a vehicle which would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver is in a position to drive or does not fall into the structure.
The proposal was extended in June and is now being dealt with by the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which says the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the project aims to relocate to the market, the car must also be part of a retraining course.
The experiment is also part of the Central Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Auto Safety Technology Institute (FITSA) framework.
According to statistics, 30-75% of cars arrested for driving several times are in the car again.
This would prevent Alcolock from getting in touch with the vehicle because the system determines the internal air alcohol level. If the larger is enabled or if the driver does not have enough time to start the car at all, the system does not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than 1000 euro art would cover the normative.
A 2007 study in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with such equipment could be reduced by at least 65% in the first year of the operation.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 people could survive this rule year by year.
The measure is also focusing on two reasons: in part, to prevent criminal proceedings from occurring in such a way as to prevent them from committing crimes,
In other words, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is in the ordinary field, while the necessary criminal reform needs to be amended by the basic law.
The operation is still not available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although some industrial and public service vehicles have already been sold in experimental mode.
The House of Lords will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which, for the example of France, will ensure that the system is discussed in schools.
In Mexico, closed shoes
With the accuracy of Angola, at the time announced in the programme, the air carrier of Asturiasi Hercegi Park, President of the Mexican city of Benito Juárez, landed in Hungary.
The day was already on fire, but it was so hot that we could only see a royal party coming out of the plane as an enemy.
On the step-by-step there were huge Spanish characters and other rare personalities.
A few hours ago I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Hercegi Par was coming to visit the city.
- Well, well, well, it's not gonna be a flight transfer until today... a woman's real estate or something.
No, sir, she's in Spain, she's only been here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican publisher, who knows everything about the Asturias Hercegi Park and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red sky on the shore, at the edge of the 27th of the sea, which is seen by the authorities as protection.
It appears that the Herzeg, smiling, wearing the seas, and then the Herzegn, has long hair in his hair, dressed in restored clothes, but not in the usual shoes, legs - perhaps they have been warned that the city of Mexico is threatened by wind.
They stop for a minute and smile at the cameras and enter the room where the official reception follows.
In the area of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - is waiting for them from one of the reporters of Mexican television.
The most valuable dividend
For a divadi transfer to the world's most suitable place in Paris, and among the living divattors today, Valentino is the most cost-effective and the most questionable.
Mango recently rejected El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards' second petition aimed at international recognition of its youth capabilities.
The principal's $300,000.
Last night Sandrina Fasoli, the first bid was won by Belga at the Paris Boulevard Housesmann's 54-kicket in Mango's own design clothes, and little by little eased out of the possibility.
According to this company's second largest business in Europe and recently opened it in 1335.
The biggest business is found in London.
In the middle of the events of the summit and in the case of Valentino, we finally found ourselves in a luxury shop in the Paris Garnier Opera.
The president's desk, prepared by Mango for the winner in Chagalok's most prominent company, has become even more visible.
Nati, who had recently died of his brother's death with a heart attack and a heart attack, wore one of the Czeg's staff and some of the ELAH. Nearly two meters high named Luis tried Valentino's head for a dinner arranged for him.
And secondly, Mango's owner and owner of the house gave the guests a little fun.
Monica Cruz came to the business in her own design and herself, and she wore a long black dress at dinner. On the night's tour, she joined Gaya Toledo's company in the ballet field so that she would take the old days off to one of the streets and immediately set up a large pool company.
Inés Sastre didn't take part in the palace visit, but he showed some pictures of his son on his mobile phone.
The next day, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he also rides two meters high and motorbikes - and John Travolta came to the Paris Intercontinental Hotel. He also brought his own slippers and wipers with him, and said well that he did not ask for any notice in the room.
The stars of Paris are under the stars.
Oh, it's life.
1001, stress relief
Not 1000, but 1,000 and one way to get rid of the catholic and brutal weekend.
Further good news is that we can find everything in one book that comes to the bookstores on 30 September to bring my peace with you.
It's about 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how exciting life is for a day than it is for today in the world.
The office's name is a fraud, and his computer's back.
Stress is the twenty-first century's population disease.
But there is not one and no two ways to reduce day-care and job problems.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
It offers a wide range of opportunities in yoga positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments in its book to all find a solution that is best suited to their favorite and free moments.
The stress operation takes the title of the 1001 relaxation method and the price relief comes from the costs of Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that work or personal relationships can almost relieve stress from the world, this manual will certainly free you from all stress.
In addition, you also serve with other ideas that help all-insulting, such as how to get closer to nature or how to produce up to 100% natural food.
If the adrenaline level has become too low to refresh the body and the central problem of stress life, it is time to get back in the photo, relax and concentrate on reading.
They're talking in dreams.
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think about those who wake up and talk about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk to them while they're asleep.
At first, the presence may seem to be a curse, but actually it's completely harmless.
It's called somniloquismus, which is somniloquismus.
Very often, mainly around children and pregnant women.
Most of them must have been told that he spoke at night.
For its normality, it can be completely raspsodic (e.g. only once in a high leg disease), or more regular (days, weeks or months once), and usually the child does not remember anything on the second day.
Unfortunately, it cannot lead back to the only choice.
They usually end up with other bedtimes, such as nightmares, night sweats, night outings (enuresis nighttime) or sleeping arrangements, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, a high-speed condition, or either a stress situation or an increased initial condition, may also be an inexplicable condition.
At least until now, they've been studied.
The intensity of the talk is very different.
It may be mild, calm, or connected with words, trembling, but it may also occur in the form of screaming, screaming or longer speech.
If the presence is very intense, it is advisable to look at the child and turn to a professional. The study can determine if there is no problem behind it and can therefore provide a solution.
As we have already mentioned, there is no cure for this condition unless it comes along with another form of treatment (e.g. sleeplessness or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, which are a measure of advance:
Let's make sure that the child stays calm before bedtime.
We choose relaxing games and decide that the child looks at scary or aggressive TV series or series.
We have learned some relaxation methods for children who are prone to aggression or who are more difficult to find inner peace.
This will help the child to get better sleep.
If you're still talking while you're sleeping, we're trying to keep our peace.
Don't forget, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Practical advice
Don't wake up the kids.
It would be ridiculous because the kid doesn't know, but he'd be out of bed.
Despite what you're talking about, she's actually sleeping and calming down.
Do not forget that if you are experiencing multiple violent harassment, you are advised to turn to a professional, which turns out to be a major disorder from your children.
If you are able to speak (this is the rarest case), do not start asking them to know anything about him.
He would be so proud because he's not so familiar with his thoughts during sleep.
On the other hand, you just listen to your talk, but you don't see any pictures of your partner, so be careful with the understanding of the audience and with the possible consequences.
Don't tell the kids they can ask their secrets at night.
Not even funny.
This has become a very big mess.
So the most important thing is that they don't worry about it, because it's just a few minutes about innocent episodes.
Finally equal in Illhaeussern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new flight, and again won a victory at his home.
Although it wasn't a heavy game, the scarves came into a situation several times, from which one was finally able to win.
The time of the shooting was not too late because the attackers found it hard to feel the right rhythm.
The first cap was shot by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was just about to hit the top of the cap. Then Illhaeusern turned to the top and followed each other the shots: Funderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn shot at the cap. Roman spicel, and Dibold at the level tried to escape the protection of Dannemarie.
On the other hand, the players were protected by a block in the middle of the facility and only by the fireplace of the superintendent Rihai.
At the beginning of the second half of the year, he promised the decisive importance: the first time Rihai and Temporale took place on Dannemarie's side. He was born after the first blast of Diebold, he got an extravagance bat with the excellent location of the Marais and then went into the cap (53 min).
However, Illhausern’s governor did not enjoy the beauty for a long time: he was forced to leave the palace 12 minutes later, so his team members had to continue the fight on their own.
However, Dannemarie was not able to take advantage of it: there were no problems with the home teams that had just moved a little bit back to strengthen their protection. One of the last seconds had some impressions when after a big seizure, the labda was very close to the capafa.
Sarkozy meets the hot fish
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a landing in Britain.
On Monday, the demonstration by the fishermen opened up several bridges and normnon-ports, so the President of the public decided to visit Finistère-beli Le Guilvinec at the end of the day to meet with his representatives.
Others promised that they would accept the president "constructively" and expressed their absurd hope that Sarkozy would come with specific proposals.
The President's visit is exactly part of the meeting of the "individual committee" which fished on board with a view to taking action against the increase in gas prices, as the oil exceeded the average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martin, president of the public sector, says that the president "will discuss with fish how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make the conditions and conditions of employment more secure for seafarers".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Two mornings before Morbihan and Calvados, they held commercial demonstrations with which they carried out nearly 10 km of raids.
They also stopped the transport of the Quiberon yacht gate, but the roads to Belle Island were not closed.
It's been set up in half a dozen districts in the Quiberon.
On Monday, seafarers had already testified about their disappearances. On the same day, rubber drums and rapacles were poured out before the firemen's fireplaces, while meetings were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
These further movements followed in the Atlantic and La Manche ports. For example, in the Vendée and Sables d'Olonne, fish were not shipped to the ship while about a hundred ships stopped the trade of ships in Le Havre.
La Turballe and Le Croisic fish are located on the other side of Loire-Atlantique.
However, the Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait for a Sunday meeting held in the ministry by a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the same "Credentials Committee" should decide on the next step and participation of the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some vessels would not like to fish if they were represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Commission did not support its efforts.
"The strikes continue," because "fishers don't allow their demands" and "they don't want to travel to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The reference fish that do not pay taxes after gas oil are currently about 50 cents paid for litres, however, they believe that the operation of a ship would only be a result if the gas price would be reduced by less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance boys are an unforgettable name for their connective home, after 83 years of death, following cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also won respect for the 83-year-old composer's title and title before Paul Newman.
Embraer has not changed its transport plan in 2008
In spite of the global economic crisis, the company plans to deliver 215 aircraft to Brazil Airports in this year.
The world's fourth largest airline company, Embraer is able to keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company's president.
In the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The company in Brazil is largely responsible for the Chinese market, particularly for 30-120 man-made aircraft.
Embraer has been delivering 41 computers for Chinese customers for up to eight years.
Over 15% of the assets sold by AIG
The American International Group, established by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its share of 85 billion dollars - it announced the Dominic Expenditure of the Financial Times.
In addition to international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, the AIG level has chosen from a large part of all other businesses - a news item that has led to resources close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of the AIG held a meeting on Friday evening to examine its sales opportunities.
The AIG has not confirmed this information.
The company’s assets are owned by AIG. The company’s International Lease Financial Corp. Aircraft Licensing Company, 59% of its share in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its own portfolio and private investments - makes it part of the Times.
According to the news, however, there is still no final decision on the sale.
The AIG must quickly liquidate its assets in order to repay $85 billion approved by the US government, thus reducing the risk that its capital should be reduced by 80% and lose its shares in an appropriate amount.
Paris Historique's study of the historic Morning Meeting
In New York the Senate announced a historic return on Monday, after the Senate restored Paulson's bank account plan. The Dow Jones index was 6.98% back (which has never been seen, is almost 800 points down), and Nasdaq is 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) is 777.68 points yellow, so 10 365.45 points closed.
The largest return of the index (884.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001, when the trade was resumed after the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.
Nasdaq 199.61 points were closed with 1,983,73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 extended index was reduced by 8,81% (from 106.85 points) to 1,106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street bridge was already weakened at the time of opening, and when the Senate suddenly withdrew its banking plan aimed at restoring market balance, it began to fly into deep air.
By 228 votes "no" against 205 "yes" the representatives returned the resources requested by the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson.
The plan was signed by two-thirds of the Republicans.
"The market has broken down bad signs because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyst.
"It is also evident how much the market has calculated for this plan," he added, then expressed concern about whether such a plan would be "too late" a few days later.
"If the plan is really going to die (...), then in Fed (the Central Bank of America) and the other central banks will have the chance to deal with the crisis and credit conditions will continue to worsen," said Brian Bethune, director of Global Insight.
The sense of urgency continues to grow, Piegza adds: "Every day you get into trouble with a new and more financial institution" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's fifth quarter, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's bank business was bought by rivals, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis quickly emerged, which made emergency measures necessary to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This means that the market "is not just an American but a global crisis" - adds the FTN Financial Analysis.
The chain market has been significantly healed.
On Friday, the 10-year runtime tax rate fell by 3,827% by 3,632% on Friday, and on the 30th, by 4,357% by 4,161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television show
Two American presidential Fridays, his first discussion followed a new one that had to admit that John McCain or Barack Obama was going out of the park as a winner.
Not surprisingly, the responsibilities of the Republican and democratic campaign have been shared with each other by the victory in the television parades, which the American households are trying to win by the third.
According to political analyst David Gergen, while John McCain's action was worthy of respect, he has not proved enough "increasing" to stop his popularity: studies prepared five weeks before the presidential election are proving this.
According to the Gallup Institute, democracy is better in the fight: according to the public opinion-research Saturday, Obama is five times as positive as McCainl (44% or 49%).
The most important computerized, still undecided, polled 39% will win Obama while 25% of McCain's winner is one, according to a CBS study.
Obama is expected to continue to increase his advantage with Joseph Biden's excellent role in the chain of events. He is prepared for his first and only public debate, Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned at the end of the week: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
They have good feelings."
McCain, who has been in the past seven years, has never failed to place his own, undisputed foreign political experience, but he stressed the "novation" in the issues that were at the centre of their first personal encounters.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." heard the attack several times.
"I don't think that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the president's position," McCain said.
This is the main area of attack, which is also used by Republican TV commercials running since yesterday.
But Obama put the volume in place to represent the future.
He didn't allow himself to be confused: he was completely and completely confused.
He stressed the ability to make good decisions and to restore the image created by the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama already does." - He wanted to return to the post last week a democratic statement that would lead to the head of the Republican, that he still did not measure the impact of the crisis on the US "the street" people.
"In nine minutes of the debate, John McCainek had many speakers about me, but nothing about you," said Obama last night before a hundred men gathered in North Carolina for the election meeting.
Not even anyone has forgotten the words "intermediate" or "workers" in his mouth, and undoubtedly the sad situation in the financial world is like Obama, who the Americans consider most useful to save the economy in the way of savings.
"The next seven can prove to be a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential democratic senator yesterday.
Rahm Emanuel, a representative of democracy, is a veteran of the Clinton government named Obama "with excellent incentives in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In view of the democratic presidential crisis, the current crisis is "the final judgment against the poor economic policy that George Bush created with the support of Senator McCain for eight years".
The Illinous Senator reaffirmed that despite the tax cuts, it would be possible to reduce the U.S. tax rate by 95% and that the country’s potential energy independence would play a key role in its development, as well as the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, however, plans to create 45 atoms by 2030.
However, both presidents were careful about the issues related to a bank settlement plan of $700 billion (470 billion) : the extraordinary plan was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: "Did you notice that the election was underway here?"
Boys and opponents were shot at the capital of the White City last night in order to avoid the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
After the closing of the polls last night, several hundred whitemen gathered in the capital of Minsk to protest against the training of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, several young President Alexandr Lukasenko has met with the following words: "Mr. Diktátor, say it!".
Some people conclude that they haven't even gone to vote, "Why would I go? So they do with my vote what they want!" says one youth.
The demonstrators do not believe that the race that has been forced to show themselves in a good way in front of foreign observers in order to build a relationship with the European Union would be ready for a democratic change.
If I were to judge the options for the observers, they would be liable to impose fines on the country under which 40 white leaders have been removed from the visa and some bank accounts have been exhausted.
According to the opposition, however, the options were not clear.
"We were also taken from the electoral committees and our observers could not take part in the vote," lamented Jurij Potyem, who was organized by the twelve parties, and was the head of the United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were just famous" - he stressed Aleksandr Milinkievics, the 2006 presidential election's protest and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is that the votes are counted, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the opposition's agents enter Parliament, it means they have been appointed and they have not been elected.
But their entry into Parliament makes it possible for them to take a place on television, sit in the regions of the country and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life because "you have to start a dialogue with the European Union".
Similarly, if our heavily sold economy comes into crisis with Russia and we are not able to renew it, we are at risk of being under Russia's control.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is of the opinion that the European Security and Cooperation Service, which is responsible for the selection process, will accept the results of the vote.
It is stressed that the participation rate appears too high and that the organisation of the pre-voting vote (which took up 26% of voters in Minsk) has allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that the election was underway here?" - question was raised by Social Democrat Aleksandr Kozulin, who was finally released from prison in August with his second wife.
There's no one in the polls.
And there will be no more than five opposition representatives in Parliament, but those who are most in line with the leadership.
It's October. It's late again.
On television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased.
The blood is safe again
The tenth anniversary of Hema-Québec's celebration last night. Dr. Francine Décary had good reason for celebrating because Hema-Québec has already become one of the most secure and efficient blood companies in the world.
And most importantly, it has been able to restore people's confidence, which has seriously affected the blood-related cancer in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood transfusions treated by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
After the drama and the general resolution, the government of Canada launched an official investigation under the direction of Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 with the aim of putting a light on what circumstances have led to the tragedy and making proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While presenting a late report to Judge Krever, some of the content created a committee that aims to design a new blood-producing system for Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee has carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports provided two blood-testing services in Canada: one of the Hema-Québec who serves Québec and the other of the Canadian Blood-Reporting Company responsible for the supply of all other ingredients and two territories.
"When Hema-Québec started its activity in 1998, people already had about 38% of their trust in the Québec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was questionable.
"In the coming years, however, we have been able to improve the safety of blood products and restore people's confidence as a result of our work on the ground." Décary adds that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population already had Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary doesn't forget that "the belief is a very rare thing."
The principle of caution has been applied since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998.
In this period, a number of cases were discussed in Europe when the cancer crisis, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, also affected new varieties of people - is reported by a doctor who has been leading the company since the establishment of 1998.
"We had no idea whether this disease was spread through blood.
We therefore supported one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to the fact that if we are at risk of serious disease outbreaks, we should only take measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob was a disease that causes the whole change so that it will inevitably die.
Thus, in April 1999, we did not accept blood transfusions from people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, all doubt was resolved to spread through the blood of the disease.
This case convinced us that we had a sense of applying the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique was identified on the market that makes HIV more sensitive to diagnosis. This is a nucleotide test (NAT), which is directly capable of detecting the virus in the blood of blood donors, and not anti-virus antibodies that were used in the past.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to reduce the period from infection until we were able to show it in the blood - explains the expert.
This period of time was also reduced for a week and a shorter period of time.
Thus, they have significantly measured the risk of blood clotting beyond the knowledge of the blood vessels and of not being able to show it.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
In our day, there is a risk that someone infected with HIV will receive 12 million blood per day.
"In other words, this means that we should buy 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec has distributed 400-500 thousand blood products every year, it should be over 24 years so that such an event can occur and someone can be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think anyone can take it calmly today or write a blood transfusion to restore health - he's the first leader in Hema-Québec.
"The next decade's challenge will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We can never know what new pathogen is going on in the system.
It was only last year that Réunion appeared on the lake of Chikungunya virus, which is similar to the Nuugat-Nílus virus.
That is why we should always be part of it," said Dr. Décary, and then stressed that he should take care of the permanent contents of Hema-Québec beyond the premise.
"The population's age also increases needs.
Since uncontrolled treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need blood transfusions or blood clots.
The population's age also affects the blood population, as the number of people who are involved in blood transfusions on the network is only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any person who is at least 18 years of age who meets the conditions of use may be given blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the participants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed have not been eligible for blood for one year.
"With this 3 percent we have so much content that we can meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to get rid of the preparations.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that they are older because they can no longer donate blood after a certain period of time.
But it's very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it's even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood vessels.
In this troubled world today, man's only hour is about to go out to give blood," laments Francine Décary.
Héma-Québec, which manages $297 million from the annual budget, not only provides blood products but also human tissues such as bone transplants, heart beats, muscle tissue and skin tissue that are used only in case of seriously affected individuals.
These texts are analyzed, modified and used, then replaced with the Hema Québec, which also manages the only public library of Québec.
A blood clot that is treated as a medical component of the skin can be obtained from a blood clot that is rich in brains and allows for the treatment of such serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that our bank had entered the fourth debt syndicate, and we planned to take out more than a thousand new models every year.
At the beginning of the coming year, we are probably starting to offer these organisations," said Dr. Décary, who says the cost-recovery program today is very popular.
"My mother is sad that there is no way to do this" - this is indeed because hema-Québec is not able to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Québec.
Summary - Impact in front of
The Montreal Impact team confirmed at 3:1 yesterday the Seattle Sounderst at the USL-1 player, and the total of 4:3 was introduced into the promoter. This was the second and most important event to take place in the Saputo stadium.
The decision-making team got Antonio Ribeiro at 90 o'clock in the competition.
While the first half-way was closed, the second was found in the enemy's network of two central installations, David Testo and Rocco Plantino.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders team has succeeded in getting Matt Jordan under arrest.
Recall that on the first Friday of the campaign, the impact of 2-1 was suffered in the town of Starfire Complex in Tuquila, Seattle.
The impact is playing with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which won the first game at 3:1 from Whitecaps, 4:3 in the first round, however, entered the Whitecaps with a total score of 5:4.
The Impact is expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Thursday, but the details of the competition are still being clarified today.
In Dióhej - Kovalev wins
The Canadian favorite triad is waiting for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn launched three major attacks and finally won the Canadians against Florida Panthers at 3:2 p.m. last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star to meet received a round. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a ball pass, which was my fourth victory from the six-prepared game.
The contest was decided by Kovalev who took the only lead in the fight.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian player.
"It takes another game to make me really feel like myself."
"He tried too much to get out of you in the first three," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy for the game's performance.
He's got a great ovulation."
Charest’s north coast
The president doesn't close the election yet.
By the end of the Liberal Party's collection, Jean Charest had already traveled to the Quebec Jean-Talon yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (paged) gave the victory at the current interim election.
"Resist our last great North border": this ambitious long-term goal was expressed by Jean Charest at the quebec Liberal Party in Lévis last night. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but the president insisted on focusing on the main thing.
During the presentation, pictures similar to "Mouslin aa images" were posted behind the back.
The three great recordings on the series were followed by: the watercraft's gears, the welding, Québec's "Google Maps", maps...
Such visible instruments have been commonly introduced during selection periods.
As a matter of fact, the Head of Government had no intention of guaranteeing that the election would no longer begin with a genuine heart, although it added that the time allocation was very serious.
"Essaik plan" for the fourth point of view of the future of Governor Québec, which is based on a "new economic area" which is linked to a French-speaking labour force agreement, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and more, an agreement with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening of the Essak (that is, the north-eastern part of the 49th century) has often played a role in the talks of the Head of Government, but has not yet been included in the presentation on this subject.
However, the Head of State simply explained why he considered the North to be "a great-grandfather of opportunities". However, he did not talk about the timing, investment amounts, or the specific importance of future projects.
There were only a few development opportunities: firstly, water vehicles, forestry, and especially pollution, which continues to sustain the growth of the developing countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
And it's "with nik, cink, branch, platinum, gold, iron, wax, titanium and even chemistry" - Charest ordered.
This is the area "two times as much as France", "our territory, Quebec.
Not only do we have but we can find ourselves" - the founder again stressed that this would create a national foundation for fraud.
He claimed that Québec's development had a great deal to do with the North: the goldsmith Abitib, our Quebec design, the James...
"This is our future!" she added, after she looked at a huge map that was found behind her.
The North Sea area of Québec includes a portion of Labrador that Québec has always followed - the head of government has announced in the press.
"This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a limit on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if I do, I will reaffirm the same reservation on behalf of the government."
On the other hand, "in view of climate change, we need to rethink our views on the North" - speaking of the governor's North-West transition, which will open every year following the reading of the Sri Lankan ice.
In the view of the Head of Government, it is an important task in this new geopolitical environment.
And what about the old people in the area, the Indians and the equipment?
The Governor said that the government of Québec would pay particular attention to them, and many of the benefits will be derived from the plan, especially for young people.
Two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (also sent by the Nguava of the Party Québecois) have already begun the association with about three local communities.
It has also started its operation by the Inter-Ministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister responsible for Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The Head of Government does not close up the possibility of a major meeting, "not necessarily boring" where "they create a common vision".
And it would be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan is coordinated, integrated into the system and will be environmentally sound" - the Governor has promised.
Jean Charest signed this "visual" as he is in line with the views of the former Liberal Prime Minister.
"Like the former liberals, we think otherwise: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was also one of the rehearsals for the weekend, which started at the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois force be crossed by Adélard-Godbout.
"Our political parties, including Godbout based on Hydro-Québece, Lesage, and the national expansion of the water tools, or Bourassa, known as James' father, all knew how to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
The press also launched another - true, conservative - art program called "Roads to the North" by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Watercraft, President Charest stated that it is planning its location for 2012.
"That's between us, but I'm planning to be there," she said to her calls, and she accepted a loud tapsvihar.
The same minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably no elections in 2009 did not close the opportunity for a vote to be held in a fair manner, which would make it possible for the law to do so.
He stressed, however, that the agenda is now full, as he has taken up duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at Québec-New York.
The meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President for the implementation of nationalist decisions, which were approved without any thought. Here is basically the term "counsel-related provisions" : the Liberal Party, in particular, follows the recognition of "Québec's own status" in the Constitution.
I would also like to call Québec's members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and these members have the right to vote in relation to the decisions taken in Quebec.
However, the opposition systematically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
The Head of the Party Québecois, Paulina Marois, re-launched the North Quebec Development Policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government which came into force in 2003 withdrew its application of this policy.
If it hadn't been done, "we'd be too much ahead" - Marois agreed with Françoise Mercure, which was the sign of the vote of Jean-Talon, who is now holding.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"We would like, however, if this wasn't an empty color," noted Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letter - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper's Office (also known as "Minister of Justice"), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada "dignified".
This is how to practice a woman who has consistently fought for justice and deserves all our miracles - this is very much about the people around the Prime Minister and also about Stephen Harper himself.
This is why our Government has not sent its own national servant from the Guantanamo concentration camp to the rest of the countries concerned.
This is the government that is absolutely not aware of the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager during the prosecution of his crimes against him.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, has rejected the word and has allowed a child to become a subject of unaccompanied circumstances.
The only government that makes a dollhouse out of justice while investigating a alleged crime.
Let's just remember that the association of UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers will also follow Omar Khadr's departure to take part in a decent procedure in Canada.
And our government has lost its eyes to torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed, and the many years of imprisonment has probably ruined his life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, now our rights, freedoms and democracy continue to be destroyed. "Democraticism": Harper is constantly hearing this word, which sounds like an empty word from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: they can voluntarily buy, sacrifice, and offend any Canadian citizen according to your permission of a government leader who has been here (and what can come after October 14th)?
Many voters believe that the community can be found on a party that celebrates Ereny, the Rules and the Order. They do not see this government as a foothold of the values that our country has appreciated for the good news and dignity.
Dear Toews, don't look for another place in the shame.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold Orwelli Hotel
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Barrick Gold, appeared on 17 September.
In the light of Orwelli's headmark, Garver says that the world's largest gold-making company has launched a six-million-dollar charge against three contractors and a small cost firm in order to launch a so-called "public dispute".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in the areas of detention - is not the truth but the rule of law.
It's not surprising that Garver has listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is Barrick Gold really the best way to destroy anyone who's against himself?
In spite of the release of the persales, the authors and distributors of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts to protect and combat in an uneven war, where on the other hand there is a team of lawyers supported by the undisputed resources of the mining industry.
In such an uneven struggle, often the tactic is used to destroy the Alpine and friendly agreement, which not only listens to the opponents but also fears those who would try to rethink the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, then he should have explained his views before the opinion.
It may well be in many other countries where Barrick Gold continues to operate, otherwise it happens in Canada that the parties are not generally at odds with each other, but they say their thoughts.
The woman would therefore have been able to open her books and dossiers and prepare for a real discussion in a publication, media, and publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not believe in the opinion, and with a movement he has written requests and letters in the protection of Noir Canada's contractors.
Mr. Garver might explain how he could start a "public" debate if he took this public opinion into account?
In the head of the presidential board, this is probably just about the charges paid by the bus and not the Canadianity: the arrest report is so complicated.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is also the responsibility of the other legislators.
The Barrick Gold, however, doesn't mean - or you don't want to understand - that Noir Canada's contractors and publishers are primarily supportive of the public because it ignores the harsh procedure of the country.
The opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of this civilized opinion, it would not be done by the press to listen to a lot more. (In other words, the term "public debate" has recently been written by Noir Canada's authors in order to retain this expression from its use.)
Garver's case is beyond the open opposition of the Barrick Gold process against the freedom and the pursuit of justice of university research, which are the cornerstones of all democratic societies.
Throughout the procedure, it recognises the right to conduct credible resources, to discuss the facts and their interpretations, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If in a country like Canada only a perennial procedure can be studied and discussed on subjects that today’s world’s rich companies don’t like, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent discussion, it could do this according to the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's contractors.
He has the right to answer.
We have been able to deal with debates, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time in our university environment.
The unintended Barrick Gold procedure shows well that it is contrary to his position that he has no interest in conducting any open debate.
This is a loss to the world of universities and to the Canadian public debate institution. It is time for governments to put in place measures that limit the legal procedures initiated for such a return.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans Joined
The Bush Government and the Presidents of the Republic and the Congress agreed yesterday on the economic rescue action, which has been the greatest regulatory plan since the great economic world power of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, which aims to raise the financial crisis that has erupted since the Wall Street months, must still be left to two Congresshouses.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure payment of public funds; new provisions for maintaining the number of households occupied by the payment of payments; enforcement law to pay the managers of the companies involved.
Henry Paulson, American Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, president of the American House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, a Republican representative who participated in the negotiations yesterday, reported the good news a few minutes ago, after the two-day marathon negotiations ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush government.
"All we have done is to save real estate and American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis," the democratic representative explained.
"The most important point is that if we don't do this, it will be awful shock, chaos and chaos in American everyday life," said the Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The negotiations have been postponed over the past few hours, fearing that there would be a further negative impact on investors' voice.
The agreement was given to you by the customs authorities until the opening of the morning.
The two Presidents who have been late for the negotiations have shown their readiness to agree, however, are not pleased that the situation has finally improved.
Barack Obama, a democratic senator, has provided for the extension of the agreement with elements such as the provisions relating to the maintenance of property or the payment of the managers of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain exceptional steps because of the indifference of other people, that is not too interesting.
These steps, however, are necessary," he noted in an American television artist.
And when he was against John McCaint asked another chaplain if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I want to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've read in large lines, it's already seen that there's something that we all need to eat and that we can go on.
The possibility of us not doing anything, simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy from their money two requirements of the U.S. financial institutions, which put some at risk, non-sustainable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month drive-out crisis initiated by the decommissioning of property. This led to the formation of hazardous property credit (remarkable credit) and then to other, credit-based securities (commercial) and ultimately to the freezing of liquid resources and to the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives of the first draft agreement closed it last week.
It seems that we have succeeded in getting out of this mess since the Democrats agreed that certain "dangerous" instruments of companies in difficulty would rather provide the government than buy them.
In order for all members of the Congress to be satisfied, there has also been a provision in the plan which provides that if the government has to carry losses within the framework of the programme for five years, it may take new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, an amount of $250 billion would first be paid; this could be followed by more than 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion payment should be approved by a new vote of the Congress.
In order to help, Washington is taking part in supported companies that receive a share of the profit and which can be sold after the crisis has ended.
The federal government will be able to arrange for the acquisition of assets that serve as a cover for the loan claims in the plan and may also reduce the maximum value for the management of the companies concerned by the crisis.
I would like the plan to be developed if the plan would vote today at the representative's house, and tomorrow's the Senate.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still not sure that the plan will be approved.
On the same day, statements against the plan were repeated by both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice," said the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there's no one who'd like the taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, the "Skeptic Groups" is another way to show things about a small convention group, but it goes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, three of them Nobel Prize-winning scientists wrote us to ask for Congress: don't hesitate, and examine your path thoroughly," Sherman said yesterday.
In Europe at the same time, it was once again understood that there is a global crisis here.
Following a crisis assessment, the three Benelux states reported that EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion) is a part of the Fortis banking group.
After the intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, it became necessary that the French BNP Paribas should not buy a competitor on the way to the market after losing 2 million euros ($2.9 billion) in the United States due to the second-party loan crisis.
Fortis 85 thousand is one of the largest European Bank of meat and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"This didn't waste money," said Minister of Finance Wouter Bos of the Netherlands last night.
"We get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what incomes and households now highly value, that the situation is unconfirmed."
In the immediate vicinity of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to set up a new bank, which has led to the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would transfer the total amount of credit to Bradford and Bringley bank, from which property loans amount to 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion U.S. dollars).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would buy British banks' subsidiaries and customers.
After Bradford and Bringley this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has been trying to resolve since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Welcome to the dance service
According to some, the most beautiful view of the birds was that they were the most vulnerable.
Did you ever get rid of her naked look?
Yeah, and not.
Through his humility, sensitivity, and ability to communicate, he stood far away from the style of war, which is the existence of the real great monster of art.
But what's gotten into a powerful ball?
At 83 years of age, Paul Newman died in college and died on Friday at the connective site. He was one of the last icons of the American music flower.
It was less monumental than Brando, who had been compared to, and who had long been counted as a rival in the film show. In his role it was more and twice more vulnerable, but he also refused to break the freedom and the drama conventions.
Blood clotting often results in extraordinarily high blood pressure.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 as a Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European poets have contributed to the birth of one of the symbols of the American dream.
He didn't think too much of you, which only increased his interests.
In the early 1950s, Yale was trained in the dramas of the New York Actor's studio before she was released into the theater, television, and not later in the music world.
In addition to being a citizen of civil rights, he was second in 1979 as an auto-competitor in the 24-hour run at Le Mans. In addition, he was held as a sex addict, probably with a woman named Joanne Woodward who lived happily married since 1958.
Now we can never know how precious this mysterious, closed, colorful life of his work that hated the show-business star. It will remain hidden for all time.
He was a man of integrity, in the most significant sense of the word.
At the end of the week, Paul Newman died many musicians: in his great role we can only see him in his black memory.
In the course of our life art, we have completed the seventh American art, which has been characterized by continuous changes in music for more than five years.
In our memory, the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys" is a beautiful Cowboya (1969) and a young man with a sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who was seen in the 1958 "Macska of the Sourceful Man" work in Tennessee Williams.
From the last few days (1990), we can recall in the case of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his early years, had not changed his expectations of marriage.
And Paul Newman has seen a lot of other faces in his movies.
Robert Wise in the film "Valaki Up there" was an unforgettable development in the role of the living criminal box, Rocky Graziano. This was the first time that James Dean had performed his career in Newman in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a British initiative called "The Great Balhey," which won Oscart in 1973 for the best film.
Robert Rossen, in his solo film "A swindler" (1961), created a racing billiard, and in a similar role he returned to Martin Scoresse in the film "The Money Colour". He received one of the nine awards of Oscar in 1987 for his latest design.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The change in the time of his flight marked the beginning.
Young people are primarily known as George Roy Hill's film "Ambitioners" (1977), where Reggie Dunlopot, a ice age group does not create a teacher who works with very common methods.
However, it was seen in 1994 by Coen's brothers in the "The Great Surgeon".
The series Sam Mendes closed the film "The Way of Evil" in 2003: it appeared last in the role of a writer.
On the contrary, many of those who had left the movie show, who had spent a long time in a flashlight, might well have betrayed Hollywood along with her cell phone, lighting and painting.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, didn't think of all humor as "the life-threatening football": he thought his game was too strong.
However, his profession was not always very nice with the beautiful Paul Newman, who spent a long time just losing his life in the movies.
Even more recently, young and successful characters: rather than living at society’s feet - a stranger, an alcoholic, a bad mood, or a lost hope - created images that were able to restore their happiness and happiness completely.
As an organizer, Newman showed a little-known face: a truly hate and sensitive person in the heart of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted by Margaret Laurence of Canada's authorship), Joanne Woodward designed a beautiful portrait of a melancholy woman.
The film "Harry and Son" produced in 1984 and with a film that stimulates acceptance and depression, and lost his son in drug abuse, recalls Scott.
Last night, Newman remembered about the scene. His close friend and former fighter, Robert Redford (who played with the "The Great Left" and the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys") lamented: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Greatness and the joy of life: this was the secret of this great color vibrating unit that we have now lost.
In addition to his career, he is fascinated by his comments on civil rights, the environment, the ongoing struggle for independent film production and the comments of Hollywood's minors.
Many times we saw the image smiling in the packaging of mares, words, cookies and other foods. It was quite a bad idea, although it was still fun at first.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the basis laid down for children in the disease.
Newman never sat on his babies. He's always committed to his business.
In his letter to five girls he wrote the following: "Your fathers were always and always very thankful for the happiness of their children.
It was great for me to be here."
It is also excellent for us to be able to complete such a long and magnificent American art.
He was a model citizen, all of them.
What did you produce in Zuschlag & Small account?
On 8 October, soon, the criminal proceedings against Zuschlag János and his companions will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused, in particular, of continuing and commercially committed marriages and other crimes - including fraud and corruption.
According to the case-law, the profit gained was used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often justified by many false accounts.
In all, public and private money - about 65 million dollars - was spent in the capital of the Children’s Ballad, and some people were deported to jail.
The method identified by the Authority was that the acquired tender money was taken up on the basis of accounts that did not have a real performance and that the associations had never made enough of the company's obligations.
According to the charge, most of the accounts were fake.
For these, account boxes were placed on the well-being market and the surroundings were made up of Kiskunhalason.
And to which companies in the name of the accountant, among other things, were sent by Zuschlag János to Lados István.
According to the latest report, you had to look at pancakes and food.
He asked for an account of his domestic consumption, which was then made available to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour sector, and the Government of the United Nations.
In most of these, Lados István, accompanied by Óri András, wrote to us most of the figures needed to achieve the aid.
Lados was one of the little girls who was studying with him.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlajek in 2003, the visitor provided food for the nine main groups of the Safe Point Joint Group.
However, according to the company manager's position, they would not have been able to enter the visitor's place at once.
Similarly, for the Better Future - later called the Third Century - the number of mistakes in the form and content set out in 2002 was reduced from formal and content errors.
There were only three rooms in the same apartment, ten people could not afford to stay in it one night, the account tells us about a hundred guests.
But in addition to this, the fantastic printers were not included in the documents for the Jobb Future and Hoppa's blood, which, according to the information given by the prosecutor, were also shown.
The company's manager, Farkas Güzözőr, told Hvg.hu that when he was invited to the trial and showed him accounts, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"Our company's name and tax are in the wrong place at the airport."
He added: For formal reasons, there was no agreement that hundreds of people were accommodated, with the same ten rooms as they do not have so much room.
In addition, she was told to feed the account while their food was out of operation for a long time.
The budgetary auditors did not follow the fact that the well-known Budapest Travel Office only organises foreign roads, thus providing Hungarian travel as a service in the cash account, which was not at all compatible with the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as it was in the course of the investigation, the document also reflected the fact that travel activities to countries outside the European Union were very expensive.
Among other things, the price was charged by Hotel Révfüllöp Kft. for four documents for the Bestb Future, the same company's service is not the 25-percent fee, but the hotel's only computer account was set up, but the purchased account was still in hand.
In addition, the account was broken down by "sellers" that in the case of a company they identified road freight as an activity carried out - it was stated through the case-law procedure - which did not continue to be carried out by the company based on the investment council.
In addition, at the level of any differences - not an appropriate accounting format, not an accurate statement - emerged that the Joint Foundation for the Third Century, the twenty-first Century Cultural Union and the Account for the Secure Point, were faked.
Whether in Ravenna Bt or in the Confederal Sports House, whose representatives admitted that they had been forgiven.
It was not observed, for example, that the hypocrisy was under the charge of the open church HIB Kft at the time (2001), when the group was fed to the Sonal Város, which is why the company's accounting insurance - according to our knowledge - also admitted that he had set out the paper.
I'm sure you're standing out.
The other group of accountants are those who were clean by having to set up a fixed account.
The Esseny Foundation for Budapest has set up an account for the Socialist Children's Fund for the Third Century, about four million for the Foundation for the Third Century.
The leader of the Collab Kft - according to the case, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic took it to issue the fictional account.
At the same time, Zuschlaje worked with the existing Biogate Ltd, which in 2003 saw the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Cross, with the accounts of five million for which there was no actual economic activity.
There is no money movement, because it was returned after the accounts were prepared, but these organisations have already forgotten to be included in their documents.
The following group of issuing companies shall be those that may be charged to the defendants.
This is how the German trade in vehicles and vehicles is a Buddhist warehouse, although there is no access to Delta Trió Kft., it was Kubatov Ivan.
The company also issued several accounts in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer equipment, at around 18 million dollars.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by the small-scale Cash Investment Ltd, which was calculated on 14 September 2005.
This company's lawyer was a Romanian man who would have forwarded to Kubatov Ivan documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that the account on behalf of kft. has been handed out to Atlas, Hoppa and the Joint Foundation for the Third Century, and he has taken up their objections.
The request for Kubatov Ivan was based on the Romanian coal miners Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd and Jos-Investment Ltd.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the accused said was the reason they didn't get a job.
The company was still benefiting from the fact that the company's defendant, Saint Zsolt, also the company's paper, has established accounts on behalf of the companies' associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlas and the Y-Generations.
The Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave Cubatov 15 accounts at 14.2 million dollars.
The prosecutor said that 10 percent of the amounts shown in the accounts and the post-paid Cuban mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to produce fixed accounts, these were made for the sale of the Secure Point.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association submitted an invitation to the socialist party's public service organisation for modern Hungary, the TMA.
They also won 500-500 thousand allowances, but the amounts were not translated for the purposes set out in the tender.
To prevent this from happening, five fixed accounts received from the Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
These accounts were also found during a house search at Kemecsei Árpád in the educational center office.
In the course of the negotiations, the complainants, as he did in the case of the case, are likely to be in the process of accounting.
It may be most interesting if you were the first to be accused, Zuschlag János decided that he would take advantage of all of this.
Eddie's testimony isn't very detailed, and although he promised to talk to everyone in public, he hasn't done it yet.
The question of whether it is in this interest is, in fact, a large part of the damage, five million forts have been committed to socialists, and Zusi will take the left.
Those who have already been affected by the fact that they will be able to cope with their circumstances have been repeatedly found on the streets for requests for shelter.
While much more damage can be done by non-exhaustive economic crimes, or at least in their own homes, they can wait for the end of the procedure against them.
The psychology of overcrowding: why do we give you more money?
In bids, buyers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the price.
This is known - and apparently irrational - as a basis for neurological-economic behaviour by New York's neurological and public administration researchers.
According to their studies in the journal Science, people do not want to stay in a competition of a type such as eBay price, which is why they pay too high prices.
The research has tried to illustrate this "playszma" part of the system with the help of pilot auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in the rating of the other group, while the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of test personnel.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during their auctions - which is an important element of the other party's tuition - is the stratatum, which is a complex part of the process of intensive action when the game is lost.
This area plays a role in the "suspending" mechanism in addition to other functions.
Therefore, researchers believe that price increases can be explained by avoiding the adverse reaction of the strain.
In support of their opinion, a financial follow-up study was also carried out by the members of the research group.
In these three groups, a partner was licensed under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned, and they did their details.
In addition, another group was promised that if they won the game, they'd get another $15.
However, the third group received $15 just before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was so much that for one of them, the loss was weighted for the gain, for the monkeys.
However, according to neurologists ’ hypothesis, members of the "waste" team were also higher than those of the control and "strong" group.
"These results cannot be derived from the concept of an existing economy.
At the same time, only with the joy of winning and the risk zone they explained the facts of the award.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we now came up with a third explanation" - Andrew Schutter, professor of the economic faculty of the New York Society.
Hepatitis: When do we turn to a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
The number of Ethanian hepatitis patients can be 100, but only one week is treated: patients often do not know that they have been infected.
Named after the combination of infectious diseases caused by various viruses.
Many of their symptoms vary from one to the other.
Hepatitis virus is spread in two main forms depending on the carocosis: hepatitis A and E through the tachycardia (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body vessels (soda, fungal infections, etc.).
Travelers have no vaccine to protect against A and B viruses.
Hepatitis Two to three weeks after the use of infected food, generally has a bad feeling, weakness, abdominal pain, anxiety.
Then, due to the skin and the whiteness of the eye, the skin becomes clear, the water becomes dark color, and the treatment may last for two or three weeks.
Millions of people died each year in the most severe type of disease, hepatitis B causes liver and liver disorders.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every 10 infected people received medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not handled, it can lead to liver failure and liver failure.
Most infected people don't know about the disease, because the pathogen destroys liver cells underground, in many cases only 20-30 years after the first symptoms occur.
So it is very important that early prevention, regular filter testing be carried out.
In three groups, on average, there are more than one such disease: blood transfusions before 1991 among people, drug users and patients.
The world currently has 200 million people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can already be shown by a routine laboratory study, it is appropriate to turn to the home doctor when you notice any unknown symptoms.
In time the disease can be treated, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating infection and preventing cancer.
On 30 September, the World Hepatitis, which was first organized by patient organisations worldwide in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to the importance of chronic liver transplantation, kidney transplantation and early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God is less hurt?
According to a recent study, religious faith serves as a sort of pain relief that could even ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
The scientists at Oxford University were conducting an interesting experiment to examine how the divine will affects people's pain detection, reported the British Telegraph.
In the course of the possible weird investigation, 12 Catholic candidates and the same atheists were involved in electricitys, while all of them were studying a painting depicting a St. Mary.
As a result, Catholics were able to exclude most of the pain.
It has also been found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians in addition to academics also take part in the different parts of the university.
The study was quite precise in that an instrument was strengthened by the left hand of the test ground which served the electrodes.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look at two strong paintings, a picture of a woman named Maria and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century, by Sassoferrato in the 17th century.
The researchers hoped that the sight of Schišz Mária would create a kind of religious state among the guests while the image of da Vinci was chosen because they did not think too different from the other and the restorative effects.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during this period they received 20 electrodes in four consecutive parts while either the subject of worship or the overall picture.
Catholics thought that during the visit of St. Mary, they felt "safe" as if they had been "dwelling" and "dwelling in peace, filled with peace."
In view of the religious theme, 12 percent were counted as less painful than seeing Leonardo’s birth before you.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who has participated in the study, thinks that any similar effect can be achieved by any powerful image, even by the atheists, only the appropriate photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that feels very positive like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright in English welcomed the results of his research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality in many cases," Wright added.
After the great results, only the question is that if Leonardo or any of the similar calibrated painters show an apple image to the callers, what effect would their pain control have on them?
Would the vision of the quality dragon Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share about yourself.
On the tenth birthday you can tell Google: people are at least as close to their heads as they are to the sun; you know where they're vacationing, what kind of events they go to and what they care about.
And it's still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main people.
However, with regard to horwell-shaped parachute skeptics, they do not directly see the thrust of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves to the original goal of Google's foundations, which he said: "Let's take all the information from the world!".
According to Google, after 10 years of worldwide work, the company is still able to handle all the information at its beginning.
The question of what will happen five years later, Schmidt replied: "Would you like Google to know answers to such questions as "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "What work is it really against me?" - but until all the time, software can't answer such simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that Internet search sites will be set up precisely to determine which IP address they were looking for and to which page the interested parties were looking for after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can save their own feedbacks, see what they have been looking for, and they will be able to find more people in a far better way - based on the same logic as the Recommendations, which provides us with products and services based on our previously mentioned and established preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they see what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are worried about seeing Google data monopolium.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be spread, not the crime, the fear of punishment, the path of freedom, and the power of the Internet will thus turn the counter-reactions.
However, it has been confirmed that not only are all sought-out expressions defined but, where appropriate, may be passed over to third parties, in such legal cases, there is nothing to protect the privacy of Internet users.
The most recent example of this was perhaps a concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google has provided the Brazilian government with information on the Community page entitled Orkut that it maintains on pedophiles, which allows for identification.
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights were still able to appear in May when the company successfully confirmed the truth in court against the FBI by the EFF Electronic Law Organisation: Google is no longer obliged to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government has been able to deal with some 50 thousand websites and thousands of search terms, which have been obtained by reference to the adoption of a child protection law over the years, but has not yet been able to obtain a list of individual users' search lists or a full list of websites and key lists of users which are extended for two months.)
The Google challenge is therefore likely to be counterproductive: those who keep their personal data from providing them, because they feel that their intimate sphere and their own pride are that Google's services are beginning to use them and they are faced with the external harassment of multiple companies located in the conservative imdj.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and its many powerful computer players, activists, users' amplifiers are the next generation of big companies, and the "time corporation" is seen in contrast with Microsoft, who is a global developer for Windows, whatever it is for both of them to fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not ask for a code to be identified by users different from Microsoft, nor does it ask for money, open, free and continuously updated source code and software packages are much more available, younger, less than six of the official software practices.
However, it may be because the geeks are able to accurately analyze the nature of personality rights and the real problem on the Internet, which is exactly one of the most popular key words in the last few years, the web 2.0 nodes after you.
The web 2.0 does not speak of the same thing as collaboration, that we leave tests on our own and use the communication channels available and while they change individually, the same thing: we show ourselves.
An average young community page can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xanga, which can be combined with other services such as Twitter or last.fm, and then include them in all of the following systems such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm, which automatically include the latest photo gallerys stored on Flickr or Picasan.
We can read about a number of examples of what makes it clear: a friend can easily understand the morning light of the common friend circle, seeing that his family friend had spent the night with his friend or was able to expel a company's employer only because his honest opinion is in his blog about senior management: a safe, private opinion is now completely overrated.
The one who lives online is from what he shows himself, so we can build a solid foundation after the behavior of young people today.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least want to become Google monopolium, he can do (for example, using Google search system, but he does not necessarily leave a print with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register with sanctions on community pages so that they are not allowed to be registered, Google’s online applications can be changed from the text editor to the author and advertisements with alternative versions that do not bind to the original server parks and which do not constitute the best profile available to us.
The opinion is not so secret when it shows Google its white face.
The company's current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising tasks threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services that are being introduced in the fastest time are causing serious headlights not only to Microsoft but also to many other software developers.
However, the critical perspectives also find powerful objections to the satisfactionor: for example, the senior management has completely rejected the opposition of the employees after doubled the company’s pay, found that the company has found too costly to feed its employees’ daily daily meals, however, it is all contrary to the fact that in 2006 Google was still headed before the Chinese government and reached its agreement with all the company’s good interests and its Chinese interests.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they do not announce a new service, only when it is already available, but the problems that are likely to occur in the coming months and years can move around the world again: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine review and archiving project has taken such measures that the company must soon look at the U.S. Supreme Court, others from the Health system, in this same whole health profile with our previous findings, our medical and problems.
And the fact that Google's genetic database is built, the next generation of sci-fi writers can also provide a good basis, the popular Cory Doctorow's novel, the Scroogled point will record the future in which a person can only get close to Google's data.
Two young men helped the Ozdi double killer in the training
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of Ozdi's double murder, who, according to the suspect, helped to eliminate the prints of the crime, said the chief police chief of Borsod was pleased.
Young people have recognized wrong actions on their behalf, and now they are accused of criminalizing them.
The two young men - according to information from the MTI - protect two girls free of charge.
Criminal proceedings may also be punishable by a loss of five years of freedom.
A 23-year-old local man was suspected of being murdered by the Ozdi double homicide.
They are accused of crimes committed by more people than they have planned, profitably.
During the investigation it was found that the 23-year-old man had a higher number of 53-year-old men.
The suspect didn't want to adjust his detention, so he spent the last week on an Ozdi telephony where he ended up, and then he was with his 9-year-old girlfriend.
According to information from the ICTI, the young man was prepared to follow up the crime, which also indicates that he was followed by the murder of the gun in the scene.
The police shall examine the circumstances of the weapon and its use by expert intervention.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech koronas - have been proposed for the purchase of a percentage share package for the price rating.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Versailles' evaluation, confirmed the offer made by the Hungarians against which the Russians had previously excluded the Russian flag from any new owners of the Prague flag.
That's why the Russian flag is in the state's hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to grant more than 60 percent of the papers within a few months.
The E15 Czech Economic Journal is new to know that the Polish proposal represents the highest amount so far offered by interested parties for the Prague tax.
According to Czech leaves so far, the peace prize, the Nasdaq Transboundary Tower, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Tower and the Deutsche Börse offered.
Petr Koblic, the chief treasurer of Prague last week, said that the worst new owner of the market would be one of the interested parties, and he did not close that this could lead to the destruction of the price value in the future.
The price value of Prague is estimated at 5-10 billion koronares by market experts.
On the basis of the shares agreement, about 90 percent of the securities could be sold.
The highest shareholding in Prague is the share of the Patria Finance Investment Bank of approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis in the face of European pages
The European pages leading in their two comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis are already "on Wednesday 11 September".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster - on the charge of the Roman Republic - the President was not yet able to suspend his own part, but following a draft legislation that was in violation of his purpose to remedy the situation of doubt...
Another Pearl Harbor instead of Warren Buffett's billion investors, it's more likely to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mondo, the lack of political leadership in the country has led to the global economy in terms of cohesion.
A woman is at risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
The Bush plan was not perfect, however, because of the Congress vote, it was dangerous for Washington not to provide a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy lies in the air - just when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism occurs.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows it to the Genif Tages-Anzeiger.
Some States can still provide relief to support funds today, and taxpayers can save them from the crisis.
But if there are more banks together than domino banks, neither money nor new settlement will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for Member States of the European Union to put themselves at their national level and to focus on the monitoring of the financial markets in question.
Only a week, more than 100 billion euros have been received by vulnerable financial institutions - a reminder of the peaceful Der Standard, which is said to be more and more real to those who are concerned that European taxpayers have to go to their pockets to deal with the crisis.
The EU has not so far been seriously involved in the crisis, which as a tsunami ends in the old continent.
Not only should the "citizens" steal hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if I set out: where it is reasonable for taxpayers to insist on money to prevent greater damage.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What would be the best way to develop technologies that are useful for preventing the shooting if it were not to follow the obstacles that occur in the world of nature?
For example, his nose.
In a remarkable project in CEATEC in Japan, the Danube bears presented the strategic thrust of the Nissan MEPs to build the next generation of non-combatant systems.
In cooperation with such a college, Nissan has built a BR23C-type biofuel control system, a robotized minivan that has been designed with the properties of mice, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that will trigger all attacks.
During the flight, every month will expand its unique personal area, which, in fact, is very similar to our security guards - explained at Kazuhiro Doi, the Technical PR and Research Development Market Manager at the exhibition.
The role of the meh composed person who is able to see more than 300 eyes in each direction.
In order to reflect on its complex function, the MEPs were moved to the idea of the duration of the creation.
In front of the BR23C, it identifies the obstacles within 2 metres, calculates the distances, and sends a signal to the transverse micro-processor immediately following the operation to avoid the attack.
In the second half of the second half of the second half of the time, notice of the obstacle, and then the carboat following the movement of the brakes, immediately changed its direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the attack.
In any way different from the current system, this avoidable manoeuvre is completely encouraging.
"If that wasn't the case, the car robot could not respond fast enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Motor Robotics Laboratory and the car robot project.
It should be responded in an exceptional way and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and final part of the security guards, a range within which the attack is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a mouse does in order to trigger other moves.
This process should be discontinued under a review.
However, in a way different from the scales, the distance cannot be directed up, down or down, only two dimensions, and only to the ability of the wheels to rotate.
In such a way, only driving and driving speeds and landings were used as an opportunity for the vehicle.
The BR23C applies lithium polymer accumulators which are easier and higher than their energy efficiency, which means that their life is longer than their change in lithium.
According to Andoh, an encouraging intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, but even less capacity to store data.
Each second of this structure must process and react to any sign of entry.
There is no need for you to keep them and to respond to the intuitous logic based on the data of the previous mangroves, so you continue to use a few thousand kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for you to get hurt, or just give me a big memory.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology for immediate deployment, which can take ten years into the production of raw cars based on Nissan's assessment.
Further application options may be provided by the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to lead the car to its intended destination by avoiding obstacles to the road.
Name has also been given to the child's mother-in-law.
The written change has been made to the $700 billion economic relief package law for the purchase of bad loans by banks in several details.
First of all, the amount will be spent.
According to the eastern party's time, during further agreements until Saturday night, Congressional leaders came to the front of the entire $700 billion relief package, announced Reuters in a round-up debate for days.
We have made some progress, said President Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who says he's only behind the agreement.
He also supported the compromise of the package by Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and will be effective, but it will require more players. It is said, unfortunately, not to save Wall Street, but to turn the economy into an economy.
The written change in the package was made public by the opening of 8 a.m. on Friday evening (that is, two hours a week by mid-European time) by Asian markets, but it was not due to a visible rise in markets.
The draft legislation on the programme, on behalf of the 2008 Economic Stabilisation Act, on the first week of the week of the law, shall be adopted by the representative of the House, and then on the agenda.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelossi on Saturday night, and the news of the agreement was also received in the White House.
We are pleased with the progress of the night and highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of bad quality, credible securities.
In the first place, the maximum amount of 700 billion can be spent immediately after the Congress is expected to use 250 billion dollars in the case, and this Ministry of Finance buys back-to-back, bad-quality securities, and another $100 billion series and depends on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special body, which will also be part of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The execution of 700 billion others depends on the Congress' new decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combination of tactics: at the same time, it may purchase bad loans, trademarks and securities that are misleading or other types of "dangerous" loans.
In the context of the procurement auctions and can be carried out directly - the department's administrations have been announced.
The legislation makes it possible for the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial sector will guarantee the funds due to concern, so that companies will pay appropriate compensation for expected damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools that at least $700 billion is sufficient for the urgent needs of the US financial system, whether it is for the purchase of a wide range of bad instruments or for their insurance, or for the avoidance of the risk of a system with a large amount of money.
We take the necessary steps to be prepared to enter the Law as soon as it is signed.
However, banks that are in need of State aid can be counted as limiting their retirement money - which the coastal river simply calls a gold miner - the government.
The limitation of payments is limited only in certain cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Finance has provided assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if you buy the ministry under the auction, you will be paid more money to the cashier unless you send it to the bank for a loan.
When bad beliefs are bought directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the leadership money is not lost.
The picture is that the existing gold-extinguishing contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones, so that they encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the US case that there will be a legal restriction on the proposal by the directors - the President of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party of Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State is entitled to participate, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can finally win in the business as the economy and with it are at the bank’s disposal.
The draft legislation contains that in the next five years the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how to recover the expected losses for taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also those on both sides who resolved their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens asked us to do, which does not protect the taxpayers' dollars - said California's Republican representative Darrell Issa.
A colleague of Ohio Democrats, Mary Captur, said that the same measures were taken by those responsible for the integration of Wall Street.
Industrial prices increased further
In August 2008, industrial domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in the previous month, compared with 12.9 percent in August 2007, according to the KSH.
The export prices of the industry increased by 1.1 per cent by July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 per cent by one year over the previous year.
As a result of the changes in domestic and export prices, industrial prices increased by 0.7 percent over the previous month and by 3.2 percent over the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 percent over the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry increased by 0.1 percent by July.
The maximum price increase was achieved in August 2008 in the leather sector (2.8%), mainly due to an increase of 4.6 per cent of cotton, cheese production and 2.5 per cent of foot-and-mouth disease.
The increase in the monthly value of the raw materials resulted in a higher price of the raw material, production of the product at the price of the product sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions have resulted in oil processing (1.4 percent), production of electricity, production of machinery (0.9 percent), and - to a minimum extent - wood processing (0.1 percent) in sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing sector, we measure the price increase between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
Prices were increased by 0.3 per cent in the electricity, gas, gas and water sector, which represented a significant weight in industrial domestic sales, mainly due to the transfer effect of official gas generation from 1 July.
In comparison for 12 months - with domestic sales of the processing industry - prices increased to a maximum of 32.4% on the coal treatment market.
The production of semi-manufactured products was 13.2 per cent in the sector, which represented food, drink, customs production, and 11 per cent in the area of production.
Price reductions in textiles, textiles production (2.5 percent), and the production of veal machinery, art (0.3 percent) in sectors.
In the other processing sector, the price increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
Over the past year, prices have increased by 10.2 percent throughout the processing industry.
The prices of the electricity, gas, gas and water sector increased by 18.7 percent in the previous year.
In the domestic sales, the highest monthly price (0.7%) was shown in the sector's supply groups in August.
Prices have not changed for the previous month in consumer goods production sectors by 0.3 percent.
In August 2008, for the same month of the previous year, the maximum price increase was observed in energy and continued use sectors (16.8 percent).
In consumer products, we measure a 6.8 percent increase in prices and a 1.4 percent decrease in investment proposals.
The export sales prices in the industry increased by 1.1 percent in August last month, and decreased by 3.9 percent by 12 months compared to 12 months.
In one month, we paid our home against the euro by 1.7 percent, the dollar by 7.1 percent, compared with the euro by 7.5 percent by August 2007, and the dollar by 15.9 percent by the dollar.
Don't I have to see the future in the United States?
Göncz Kinga is a good example of the entry into force of the American-Mayar visa agreement on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Chicago spoke before the local Hungarian leadership.
According to the opinion, "all in good shape now depends only on whether the electronic input system or control system is out at sea in time".
At the same time, he called on the attention that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but the tourists will have to register themselves before the start of the trip.
The Hungarian Diplomatic Leader is currently holding negotiations in Washington.
He is meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who is being sent by the Hungarian Public Interests Centre to the Barack Obama Democratic Party and foreign political councillor John McCain of the Republican Republic.
Barack Obama and McCain are next to the banking package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the president of the two large American parties, gave each other support for the government's $700 billion banking assistance package on Friday, but there is a political party that is following the discharge of the Minister of Finance.
Following the talks held on Friday following the days of the Congress and the representatives of the Administration, a preliminary agreement was signed on the banking package.
The financial package aimed at removing the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain are also focusing their attention on how to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest studies, Obama has made some progress in the face of economic issues, reading the benefit of McCain, which he received after the Republican Convention, as Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed his hope on a day-to-day detroit campaign that the Congress would quickly accept the 700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passports he also supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) your position, savings, entire industries, the whole economy's stability is at risk," he said before the 35th crowd.
He didn't hesitate to call McCain's economic imagination back in time.
McCain said in his interview with ABC, "We're all going to be hard to be... but there's just no way to go."
The Senator of the Republic announced that the proposal involved the establishment of a monitoring committee for the Ministry of Finance and the limitation of the execution of the perpetrators, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCaininek was not an important part of the agreements, but he was in contact with the minister every day.
On Thursday, President Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would probably have voted on the bill by week.
Children’s Picture of the German Language
The right-hand camp is not affected, only in the camp has become more influential - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak involvement of CSU in Bavaria.
Haiderek is preparing for the Austrian government to stop the red-white coalition.
Mirror (spigel.de)
In the online release of the Baoldal German news magazine, Franz Walter, Bavaria, publishes a review of the causes of CSU’s dramatic blood pressure.
According to a well-known politician, the CSU's erosion had begun well before the heavy Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over his office.
Over the decades, Christian socialists have renewed their country - and now these modern - day citizens are turning away from them.
The change is the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The failure was not surprising for the CSU, but it ended on Friday, which was exactly ten years likely: a state-owned hegemony disappeared.
For ten years, in 1998, the CSU has grown to 47.7 percent, for the first time since the fifteen years under 50 percent.
This was repeated three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is why the above mentioned Stoiber times.
This is why CSU is responsible for the subsequent modernisation of the content, which is responsible for raising their parents.
Sociologists have been doing this for 40 years, but they have been deeply disappointed in the temple. However, there have been no consequences for the integrity of the CSU voters without the involvement of seculization, educational results, Eastern and Northern Europe in the developing regions of the country.
Modernization is accompanied by increased opportunities and political consequences can also be seen.
The right-hand camp is unaffected, only within the camp has become more bolder, more critical, more developed.
It is also apparent that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been largely removed from the CSU; free employment, the parishioners, the parishioners and the capital are effective.
There's already under 40 percent of CSU support.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Peace Day "Who, with whom? The Parties on the issues raised by the parties" deals with a difficult internal political situation following the elections of the parties.
The SPU wants to discuss with the OVP.
The OVP shall prohibit the introduction of SPU into its premises.
The BZU is open to negotiations, and the Greens still don't want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, participants were almost allowed to look into their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to talk to the OVP.
The SSP also wants to show that it is possible to work together with the two parties - in some households and in social partnership.
The question of a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current OVP president as well as with the alcancellary - has been left open to Faymann.
As you can imagine, the Schüssel-Molterer course was taken everywhere.
This direction does not come into play.
Multer responded carefully to red suggestions.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann seeks to intervene in the OVP's premises.
If a party chooses the opposition or enters into the coalition, which is fully open to the party first, questions should be discussed within the CFSP.
President Jørg Haider BZÖ has again shown them to be open in all directions.
"To prevent red-white coalitions, we're ready for government responsibility," Haider added.
Player: We need to break the cycle of poverty, segregation
Today, in Paris, France's home administration, representing the European Union's presidency of the European Union, has begun.
Járóka Lívia, the representative of the European University of Applied Sciences, called attention to the educational segregation of the professional council as one of its main chambers, as this is also a major obstacle to the legality and effectiveness of Roma children.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was launched by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and opportunities.
The Council invited governments, European social partners and representatives of European law and civil organisations to take their place in the area of equality.
Járóka - according to the press release of the Fidesz Group of EP - has warned that, despite the fact that there is a difference in employment, there are fewer education companies in the Roma in the first place on the labour market.
"The majority of Roma young people have no medium-term performance, and because of poor quality base education, only a small part of them can get top performance."
Járóka further stressed that as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to make these connections known in the largest area - Roma and non-Romans.
As in the past, the Roman students started school, so that women could become members of the labour market; they are contributing to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"The Roma must guarantee the rights of their EU citizens to quality education and guarantee their low-level and differentiated education," Járóka Livia said.
According to the representative, the European Union's objective and action-oriented approach is essential for the immediate revitalization of school disaggregation processes and for the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"There must be an end to poverty, segregation and unemployment, and the Roma children must be given the opportunity to become full-time citizens of Europe," Jaróka said.
In the context of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" for All, the European Court of Justice, which has been organised annually since its meeting in Berlin, aims to ensure a single forum for the promotion of equal opportunities and freedom of expression at European and Member State level.
CSU: transitional period of extension
At the end of October, they decided on the series of Huber-Becksteins.
Despite the noise of the chaos, heads were not yet dead, the poor CSU cuts were first launched to discuss personal questions.
Mr. Erwin Huber and the Governor of Günther Beckstein may still be on the spot, asking how long he's been up.
At the end of October, a special party convention will be held at the end of the final week of the 17th century, which will eliminate the catastrophic loss of crops.
Many ruling parishioners felt everywhere: they don't put all their strength into their chair.
This led to the formation of the group and its members of the basic anger, who one day demanded personal consequences after "bajor cunami" because of the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, with the opinion of Edmund Stoiber, who was still in trouble - the Christian social union received 60.7 percent, however, only 43.4 percent of their strengths after a year of beatings against Stoiber.
For 46 years CSU has been "one-off" in the German GDP 18 percent tax in Belarus.
Conservatives continue to be highly regarded in a key South-South context for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they are forced into coalition at all costs.
As one of the first elements of the deal in the party, President Horst Seahofer and Federal Agriculture Minister of the Huber's potential successor, Mr Horst Seahofer, also have a place in the selection team, which is organised with the liberal FDP or with the right-wing voters, starting negotiations with a possible Munich government coalition.
The series of weird jokes that the Free Elections list includes the legislation of Gabriele Pauli, who used his move against Stoiber as a parlor of Huber-Beckstein, and then suddenly withdrew from the very concerned self-government politician.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into something to stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, it will play an active role as well as Stoiber, who is behind the scenes, called the last day of the CSU's political launch of the former President-in-Office and former President-in-Office of the CSU.
Huber's weekly notes on the CDU would have been appreciated with much more support from the brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians have explained the guilt that the warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel is also being made.
Following the German election in September 2009, Markel cannot be a Chancellor if he or she does not have a CSU that plays a significant role in 2005’s national success.
According to Markel, the loss of the CSU will not be negative for the Berlin Grandfather.
What is of course relevant: the crisis of social democracy will not be easier to deal with and will continue.
SPD 18.6 percent have been most successful since 1946 in Belarus.
Lukasenko resistance: 110-0
No opposition representative entered the White House on the basis of the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability provided in the country led by Aleksandr Lukasenko, according to the European Security and Cooperation Service (EESC), however, by the illegality of the vote.
The EBESZ, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the choices.
Although the main legislation of 10 million countries has been passed over for decades without opposition, before yesterday's elections, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) had seriously hoped that, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution, the appointment of President for the 2006 clean elections under discussion would also be renewed by the fourth time Lukesenko's "magedi" performance in Parliament.
The ODS has also been removed from the pre-measured shell.
Following opposition expectations, it was suggested that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has been entrusted with the ongoing demand for Russian gas imports and has also contributed to the recovery of the Russian gas pipeline in the country - wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-level politicians were not allowed to enter into force because of the anti-democratic white policy system.
In advance, it was recalled that when the EESC assessed the election campaign, it was preferable to positive movements and not to shortcomings - for example, to avoid the introduction of a third of the opposition's signs.
However, the EESC's weekly report has already adopted the campaign - during which the opposition's main features could not be included in the press - and in particular that opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
In addition, the opposition suggests that there is still a significant improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is also willing to face a smaller confrontation with Moscow, with the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with the creation of a federal paper union in Belarus - has considered the two areas to be independent for one month.
- We took two steps forward, one at a time, but most importantly that the dialogue started between Belarus and the EU - Aleksandr Milinkevic told us.
According to the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to remain this despite the fact that "the power to allow an objection to the House of Lords is denied."
The opposition does not intend to oppose actions in the light of the results, rather than try to send the voters a message on the need for economic reforms.
- Of course, we have many problems, we have to print anti-corruption pages in Russia, and the local authorities are making obstacles to the spread, but I also see that they are increasingly supporting the change, even over the ages - Milinkevics said that according to the rank of Lukasenko, which is considered the most important result of the creation of social security, even the number of officially supported pensions is not the same as the number of pensions.
- The sale of the country, the increase in trade deficit, the issue of time for the social security of the "dwelling community" - Millinkevics said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers qualified democratically for the elections.
Szergej Lebegyev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian government of Ria Novoszti: "Not words, but acts, people believe," so that the lack of opposition is no more than evidence of the sensitivity of white voters.
Brunetta: "Only before working time"
In the history of the Chigi Palota, carriers were only made available for the entry and entry of workers.
From today's day on, this new measure is taking place against the prosecutors, those who block and then go to a coffee shop.
Today, Naplopolitic news was presented to the Prime Minister Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's chief minister.
"The benefits - Brunetta said - are better and more effective, reducing shortcomings and increasing services"
"A new, more responsible and more transparent period will follow.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
The equipment of all buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed with the Chigi Palace.
Masi says "it's also symbolic to say that it's important to talk about the bikes."
We did not experience opposition from the users, he confirmed the principal: "The workers adjusted the measure, everyone cooperated."
So it's over at breakfast's time. There's no more coffee and wine.
Brunetta suggests: "A good little capuccino in the morning, capable of miracles"
At the University of Rome
In its advice, the Minister noted: "For three months, 50 percent of the unemployed in the public sector have been reduced by the lack of health care, which means more than six billion workers in one year".
It added that the Italian public administration should be more effective
"which, according to the Minister, was twice as private as in the last 8-10 years as in the private sector, and well exceeded the rate of inflation."
At the same time, several thousand groups have been gathered together to join the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Services Service to oppose the provisions of the Brunetta-like Regulation.
"As the Department of Public Administration is raising data to support the recovery of deficiencies due to disease, the number of 'non-favoured days' is increasing steadily," says the Consumer Protection Unit.
Italy loved several thousand decent and hard-working public administrations to send a message to the illegal provisions of the Regulation."
The Regional Public Administration Court shall include, among other things, the elimination of additional equipment for reversible diseases, the extension of the period of stay of workers in the home of the sick, which shall mean the period within which the patient may be present and other aspects of the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Work accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything
In Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work every day, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent deaths.
According to employment insurance data, approximately 1,200 deaths occurred in 2007 at workplaces.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is still one of the most common causes of death, and almost twice as many victims as humans are.
Today, Anmil conducts 58 times in all parts of Italy on the day of the traditional October second week of work of the victims of workplace accidents to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The data collected by Anmil and the tragic events of the last few days also support the fact that workplace accidents play an important role in the prevention of accidents," stated the President of the Republic of Georgia to Pietro Mercandelli in his letter to the President of the National Union for the Bachelor of Labour.
The Head of State has sincerely stressed its commitment to "the protection of the interests of workers suffering from accidents, the assistance of victims' families and the role of the public opinion".
"Naturally and honestly, all of us have faced such a dramatic challenge, including the media and the media's interest in the opinion, but we really need to face day-to-day dramas, again and again."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are certainly fighting with resources, which is crucial to financing education and information.
It is particularly important that school initiatives aimed at the direct enlightenment of young people in the labour market.
Our duty is to maintain interest in the present, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue and to require more effective legislation to be taken into consideration.
Vice-President Gianfranco Fini stressed from his own part that "the serious social importance of the death-related workplace accidents will be achieved by all of us, and the institutions will be required to do so before they end".
"The data on workplace accidents are quite a suggestion, but the number of such significant deaths is still surprisingly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, President Anmil.
"We don't want it to be the same if it's a lower trend, a lower focus, because it's the biggest tragedy at the bottom of the attention."
"We believe that we are still not doing everything to resolve the situation, which would be solved by an integrated action programme.
In our opinion, it would be necessary to monitor and control more closely - it stressed Mercandelli - and to involve more significantly in the field of labour training, starting with school education."
"There is also a need for further efforts to inform the opinion and to make it more effective," he added.
However, it would be most necessary for Amiri to have a more responsible working environment in the face of a social problem."
Mercandelli then ruled on "the increase in the number of victims of occupational accidents who have been victims of road accidents" as well as "the aid directive to which the system has been subject in recent years".
"The aim is to return workers security to security because those who suffer from the accident can not rely on the lawmakers where they are willing and where they are divided."
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
For example, MP3 products can be heard for a longer time and in high volume.
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU, the Scientific Committee for New and Recognised Health Risks (SCENIHR) refers to the public opinion today.
"It is evident from the experience that those who have been listening to loud music over a five-year period can suffer from a five-year-old hearing disorder" - can read in the explanation.
"It's a shame that young people who use loud and frequent loud-voting players and mobile phones are not sure they can't hurt their ears without turning back," said Megena Kuneva.
"Scientific research poses an irrefutable risk to which we must respond immediately," the EU added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information in a wide range of ways.
In the light of the above-mentioned approach, we must also examine existing control systems so that they can function efficiently and take action with the latest technologies."
He asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem with regard to the diversity of potential players and the increase in the number of young people involved in gambling.
"The researchers confirm our concerns, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and interested parties, is ready to examine what possible measures can be taken to protect children and young people from the harassment of potential predators and similar devices," said the member of the Committee.
The current European security requirement in 100 dB sets a maximum sound level available by the host players, but increases concern is due to data from over-use of such audio sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise which can significantly reduce these hearing disorders.
In the opinion of the Scientific Committee of the EU, it is clear from the experience of users who listen to a five-hour high voice (more than 89 decibels) during the week to listen to the sound of the sound at work, that the sound is above the maximum of the current value for the sound of the work.
If a person hears music in similar circumstances for a longer time, five years will result in the risk of hearing loss.
This can affect around 5-10 percent of users, including 2.5-10 million heads in the EU.
Rome, Germanno will establish a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It's starting today, it's held in March, the results are expected in June.
This list was set out for the work of the Committee called "the future of the capital city of Rome" which was assembled this morning in the new section following the Caracalla.
The next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Committee shall draw up the Roma Directives.
Following the end of March, the study and plans shall be discussed in the public assembly and in the self-government committee so as to allow for the formal strategic plan approved by the Head of State and Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee which represents its various political, social and cultural representation - it stresses the duty of Germanno - to work on proposals for Roma development schemes which policy makers can therefore support the Assembly and the Intergovernmental Committee.
There is no question of any potential incompatibility, just a platform where there can be great plans to serve the good of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the Commission will be divided because it has a mandate for a specified time.
In June we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee called "the future of the capital city of Rome" - the mayor of the capital announced.
Those responsible for the functioning of the Commission, referring to the fact that the expertise provided by it is not bound by force, Alemanno answers: "All depends on what work the Commission is doing and on what colourful proposals it makes on the table.
If the level is appropriate, as in France as in the case of the Attal Commission, which I am sure to take in Rome, there will be an important role to play in its contribution.
The nature of the policy is often distorted in day-to-day affairs and in the face of time-consuming emergencies.
In this respect, we look beyond the distance and plan for a longer distance, and we work for the development and future of Rome."
The President of the European Union wishes to say that "this Commission cannot be considered to be a 'waterhead' because it is not going to be fully free to become a euro for the Roma, it serves as an opinion and aims to introduce the best ideas in the capital".
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework which enables our cities to build on a level playing field that they would need so much to think about in a united spirit about the future."
About the future, which the Mayor of Rome stresses: "Not only will it be limited to the current government frameworks, but much more far away," we see not only the declining metropolis and the capital status, but also "the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as capital cities and must play."
The first American anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second American opposition president.
It was Jimmy Carter's first decision to break up the American economy and establish a strong relationship (as it does today as a personal) with the enemy Islam."
As the time of the elections draws near, attacks against Obama will be halted.
A Miami woman wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama suddenly thinks he can win a nation's highest public value, which has been a total of two rulers and five Saints!"
These attacks are really nothing; they are, of course, racist, but they do not answer the voter's question of whether he will be a good president. Then there are public opinion research here: it means Obama will win, even on a significant scale.
In this case there is also one who listens to his feelings and does not listen to his feelings.
In the interior of the South States, a Mississippi newspaper has written this in its guides: we know that in the vote room the real American home will vote.
The American way of thinking is reflected here on a page that has remained hidden until the last minute.
"Just tell me what you want, and we'll know where we're going to take the boat, Obamár or McCain."
There are those who swear that if Obama wins, he'll leave the United States.
They have never heard such words until now when the black mark is sure to succeed.
At the same time, despite all the reasonings, it's George Bush who wins the democratic weapon.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during the official Bush era? 89 percent replied that Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 troops in Vietnam, and they were forced to fly home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans didn't have to pack up.
Most people still think Iraq was Bush's weak point.
The original task is for George W.. to be replaced.
U.S.: The news reporters have already felt the economic breakdown, the time of the cuts has come in the structures. Many people around the Internet, because of the printed "death".
The PEW research agency asked five hundred U.S. journalists how they feel about their future situation and spiritual power.
Well, now almost every journalist is a pessimist for his own future.
However, there was no clear indication that concerns about credibility would be reduced.
You don't feel as tired as you used to.
The problem of American journalists is money.
We consider the 2008 crisis to be a weak economic model.
Further serious concerns are reported to the newsroom, i.e. cuts to the structures that make the news.
If we do not want the traditional paper to be signed, in the sense of what the big audience is doing during this, at least stress this problem should be solved - the journalists asked.
Today's well-known and complex pessimism is an American novel.
Six percent of journalists and senior leaders in the printed press are convinced that national jurnalism is wrong.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior leadership position.
Printed against e-mail.
Public employees don't find it difficult to see where the world is headed.
Most of the publishers are on their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the printed "killer".
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has grown to 79 percent.
The 500 wanted reporters admitted that technology is making its way down in hopes that perhaps it will be for the sake of zsurnalism.
Today in the American press, there is a gap between structural leaders, the directors, and the scientists who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of managers are sure that their researchers share their information with others, while at the local level this rate is only 23 percent.
In some cases this is linked to a certain job.
At the national level, 47 percent of the leaders feel that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "certain work" is on the team (for our editors, sir.) on a regular basis.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
For a powerful nation like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service are operating, the workers usually offer as much as they want, so the matter is "well or not" based on.
Directors usually receive high pay, and editors may also demand tens of thousands of dollars on the monthly payment of the pension and health insurance fee.
However, freedom is potentially blocked: in the first year of x day, at the third level, until a certain period of time does not exceed 15 days.
But U.S. reporters, according to their own admission, often "be ill" during the year.
It's all about the air.
UNIPOL: ROMANS: DANilo Coppola GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinado, President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, rejected Danilo Coppola's application to move from his residence to a Roman residence in Grottaferra.
Because of the economic effort against Coppola, investigations are being carried out in the context of an investigation into the case of the Unipol-BNL-participation agreement.
Last week, during the procedure initiated against, the house guard was replaced and the residence permit for Grottafertra was changed.
The lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella were asked to transfer the owner to the capital of the rural village.
However, the Court considers that these incentives (for which the case-by-case proposal has been proposed) would allow the company to influence its cases and adapt to the evidence it has provided.
It's dangerous.
The presence was already sensitive a few days ago when the House of Lords did not vote for 700 billion dollars of relief packages extended by the White House: the important part of the Americans was more interested and still interested in the punishment of the Wall Street than the rescue of the economy.
It also supports the New York Times yesterday, which has reported that the current crisis has resulted in an increase in the participation of the Republican Parton, which shows a growing share of the traditional, accepted, federal institutions and business circles in support of the Eastern Party and the growing strength of the Washington and the financial world in central and southern states.
This Directive shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in a critical manner.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that you can see or see before the current economic downturn, and not only in the United States but in the world of peace, perhaps beyond that.
It seems that the crisis in the United States and Europe is only a reminder of the long-term side effects of lightning that are being pushed into this new atmosphere and finally become a reality.
The first is the return of the two categories of renewal, of state sovereignty to society, in relation to the re-establishment of the economy of one type.
The crisis affects the same banking institutions that establish such a close relationship with the foreign country, in particular, and in a wide range of circumstances, people and families who live in a country alone.
However, this is a direct political difficulty for those in the government: what will be the response to the difficulties and obstacles of those who choose one another?
So in the economic context of the crisis, it seems to be global, but it is only national in the political sense.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially beyond the scope of this: there is strong evidence of this in the European Union, which is not capable of defining a uniform policy directive between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone from individual national governments is expecting intervention, rescue packages, restructuring and new rules, but most of all, the opening of funds: because in this situation, only the individual states have economic resources, with financial resources that can be managed.
They also have tools and powers to use them: there are two invaluable sources in these circumstances which are likely to never have any other market and one international organisation in such a way.
On the other hand, the new voice imposed by the crisis on the national state is in full harmony with the fact that economic growth in recent times has an increasingly important element which is closely linked to this element: and this is the area.
In the same way as Paradise, since we were convinced that we had already entered the network, that we are becoming more and more technology into the world, and we were convinced that the global financial world was designed to dominate the world, once we had to realize that our future depended more and more on things like water, nature and oil.
From things that can be transported from one planet to the other, they can be transported to a restricted place, to one area.
So he who rules the area has a lot more than he who is born in an unhappy place where there is no nature, no oil, and no water.
I'd like to take this through to the second novelty that's a kind of nervous system.
Those who say that the area, the state, the government, is also saying, as necessary: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it appears that the economic crisis is producing two complementary elements:
Part of the objective recognition that there is a need for reliable guidance for those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the total credit loss of economic leaders who have proved totally useless and have proved that there are still many ahead of us in the rural area.
The two are even more important and more reassuring in a sense: the loss of credit, intolerance, incompetence and discrimination, which is becoming increasingly common in the developing world.
It seems that the population is becoming more and more confused about the conviction that the social era that has so far been cut short. It has been, even before they did, their experiences, their lifestyles, their cultures, in the sense of complex words, would have been self-evident. This social culture is increasingly influenced by the majority's opinion.
Similarly, the need for leadership in the form of a dedicated but powerful delegation is fueled by a strong movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. These voters were not expected to be "in their ranks", or in recent times to announce changes in public order. For example, the power of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the integration of the labour force in Great Britain or the defeat of American Congressmen Bush (and perhaps the Italian right-wing victory can be won here).
It seems that with the traditional elite, its partners, its programmes, we could also say that with its habits, its publications and its reputation, it is becoming less and less understood, which is why it is becoming less and less able to represent what once is going on in the deeper spheres of modern society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is becoming stronger, wider and potentially more competitive.
In spite of all of them, it would be too much to speak honestly about "the crowd's crashing in the corner."
But he opened his eyes to walk at all.
We can walk with superpowers on the wall.
With the help of a superpower to suppress gravity and walk away like Pokeman.
This goal has been set up by several American research centres, and a group set up by four institutions is close to the solution.
With a total length of 2.5 inches [2.5 cm] of strength, the researchers were able to hold a 100 kilogram body to an independent edge and keep it there.
TANULMANY - The American Journal of Science published the findings of some of its researchers at the Denton University, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance already existed, especially in the United States, from the further development of structural substances already existing by the Scientific Group.
"The fast operation principle should be described as a package of spaghetti" says a researcher from the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have developed the idea of a foot covered with green microscopic fibers, which provides perfect detection for the animal.
The tests performed with different substances, such as glass, teflon and cysole paper, were based on the fact that the new ten times more effective than the said fools, while "will be removed from the wall" - explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Daytonian University's metrician gold.
FALON JARNI? - "This material can be useful as a temporary booster" - adds Liming Dai.
Maybe yes, but researchers think more than one, less amazing use than the combination of electronic products, because the nerve fibers are well controlled by heat and electricity.
Further applications may also be found in the area of radiation.
The superhero can still wait.
THE Messiah’S EMPLOYMENT - The California Berkeley Society is also carrying out experiments with a new fuel.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society c. series, California scientists have shown a hairy, microsalic substance that passes through the upper movement, thus always providing perfect detection.
They're drugs, they're on fruit juice.
Care should be taken with grapefruits, oranges and apples.
These high levels of vitamins, mainly in the urine, are popular in combination with certain life-threatening medicinal products in the body, change their contents, whether they are confirmed or reduced depending on the case, and this may also lead to serious health consequences.
Professor David Bailey of London University of Western Ontario drew attention to the risk of joint use of do good or fresh fruits and certain medicinal products. At a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, the professor said: a couple of grapefruits, oranges or apples can reduce the impact of certain life-threatening drugs and prevent the health of the patient.
Grapefruit was also used earlier in the case of complaints when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamines, somnolence, cardiovascular control and antidiagnoses may be considered toxic.
KOCKAZAZAGES - Two years ago, you brought the Olasz Medical Institute to the public at its official address, and once warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to consider what medicines they eat when taking, for example, Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, narancs and almaline also contain substances that interfere with the efficacy of the medicinal products.
A long list of the active substances that prevent the excretion of grapefruits and other fruit juices may be laid down.
This draws attention to Michele Carruba, a professor of medicine in the United States of Milan: "These findings are usually attributed to different national and international pharmaceutical institutions who, if necessary, take care to change the data contained in the information provided by the notified body.
Therefore, we must always read the package leaflet and, if something is not understood, do not let us influence ourselves, but, of course, ask our doctor or pharmacist" - Ansa stressed to the experts of the Institute.
Paul Krugman received the public Nobel Prize
The US Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Public Finance, Trade Models and Economic Activities for the Analysis of Regional Relations.
The 55-year-old Neokinesian Krugman, Princeton University, is a well-known publisher of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the best judges of the Bush government's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron was in trouble, Krugman, in his guide published in New York Times, pointed out that the last event, in view of the history of the United States, is going to have more serious consequences than the sum of the sharks.
This statement has not only raised a little debate, it has been taken on behalf of the public administration, but we already know it was true today.
"I'm still surprised and a little bit too much to know how quickly Enron or Worldcom's botanical composition has gone beyond public interest," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the European Central Bank Executive Board, Krugman is a "roppant valuable manager", while possibly "in aggressive style he spreads his criticisms against Bush government over liberalism."
Open Office, third edition also understood the "Micropolis" package
Today there is an OpenOffice.org 3.0 open-source application package that aims at increasing levels as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free employment to public administration.
After almost one year's work by SUN Microsystem, and by voluntary developers, the new Open Office is doing more innovations to the public: in addition to the welcome map and the newly-designed, less-fashioned user surface, it offers more important innovations. For example, the compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operating system and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to the ISO standard.
Special attention was paid to the compatibility of the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open new extended Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to see some more specific modules, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint indicators. This can be useful for sending files via e-mail. Another feature supports importing them into the PDF file graphical module by keeping the correct settings.
We can also create hybrid PDF documents on this surface that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
The sharing of applications has also gone through a number of developments: the table manager supports the common use of the workshops, but does not prevent the creation of one another's work. Each employee's contribution is marked by a different color, which will help to make it easier to identify in the control phase.
Some companies already work to make some of their functions available on the Internet (on the cloud, above), so that the final change can be made in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available on the Mirror pages since Friday, can be filled out at: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is available to Linux in addition to normal Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can transfer the installation CD to either our home or our place of work.
Since the distribution of the home application is likely to mean freedom of choice, the Open Office software package is now trying to get rid of the business sector because it can also be counted on a number of government and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises that can open up new business opportunities.
The Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, the Word-compatible Text Editor; Calc, a table manager for Excel replacement; Impress, Powerpoint presentation; the Dbase is the most famous, access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads, but if we consider that we are already at 3.600,000 as a new version, this number will probably be higher than expected.
This is the fourth dopping drug.
In the last phase of Tour de France, another positive sample was produced by one of the participants, a group of contestants in the colour of the Gerolsteiner Group, Bernhard Kohl, who also won the triumph of the best mountain range.
The news on the website of the Team Internet News.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepol, and the German-level Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who produced positive results in the Cera test of the third generation of EPO.
Kohl's blood count, similar to the tests performed in the last weeks, were examined by the labs of lasanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If control tests also confirm the positive result of Cera, the strands lose their third position and are removed from competition for two years according to the requirements.
The report on the positive outcome of the third generation EPO test by Kohl was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Dopping Against Agency, and was published by the Associated Press Office: a positive doppling report to the district authorities.
The 26-year-old districts in Spain, Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, have won the top-down tricoon of the best mountain range.
COVER SUBJECT: A NEW YORK IS REBUILDING THE GOOD SON, IS IT POSSIBLE?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of immigrants to one of the most popular destinations of the immigrants who have been accepted.
That's why the "Belpaese" racialist nation was born? This question is raised by the New York Times, which emerged from the case of young Burkina Faso by Abdul William Guibre - who killed him in Milan last month because he stole a boxing text - a long article from the debate on racism in Italy.
This is well symbolized by what the New York Times calls "paradoxone of the grasslands": in the northern regions "the strongest integration and the highest employment" as well as "the support of immigration and the North-West League" in the country.
In order to support the growing gap between Italians and immigrants, the NYT is also the case in Milan, Parmá, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
I'm sorry.
The new laws adopted by the League, which would make the gap more stringent in terms of immigration and facilitate the exclusion of illegal immigrants, became examples of the change in voice in Italy.
The said trend is also expressed by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Georgia Napolitano XVI met with me at the Quirinale Palace and found that the State and the Church work together to combat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rent fees, even if they can reach 900 euros
The market for hotels issued by universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest study by the Sunia, the Institute of Economics, a student can also pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The presence has already reached such amazing sizes that - due to the three major expenses for families - the wide range of students is shut down from learning opportunity," explains Laura Mariani, director of the Sunia Research Office. "In these cities, the high demand for students has so far turned the market into an overall dragout process for local residents."
In most cases, assets also contain a series of irregularities: contracts not registered, non-restricted interest rate restrictions, related considerations.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be necessary which would allow for a review of the tax system to maximize prices.
The study shows that in Milan, Brianza's area includes 450 euros for a bed; the price of a single room from 650 euros (Bande Nere's) averages up to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it also has 900 euros (Vittoria's district).
In Florence, an average bed will reach 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students live close to my university, a flat will go to EUR 250/280 if it's double and EUR 370-500 if it's a single room.
In the vicinity of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single and 450-person bed in a double room.
With something cheaper (EUR 550 per room) prices in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the outlying areas, you can see something: 300 euros into a bed and 450 rooms in a single room Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In the afternoon, 300/450 euros are requested for a stay, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The property is the highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Amini.
At the bar, you need to pay €250/350 for a bed room and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are as low as they are, but they represent a higher burden within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, another irregularity can also be experienced: foreign students are asked for a wage of 25-30 per cent higher than Italian buyers.
Welcome to the old cinema Paradise, the time of the old concert in the cities
Traditional music for multiplexes.
"A city where there are no moves, a city is empty, like a face without a face."
The photos produced by Giuseppe Tornatore are shown effectively all that is happening in the Italian cities, but also in the rural regions.
The reduction of music - the display of large, multi-heavy music in foreign cities, and the confusion of the buildings found in the city centres - is inevitable and irretrievable, but at the same time it carries all the features of a true cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places appear, "It's like a friend of ours would go away, a familiar one with whom we shared our lives and many experiences," says the director of the cinema Paradiseo. The film, which announced Oscar's prize and the grandness of the Cannes festival, told Tornatore about the history of a small city's music story, followed by a music event that was probably lost for all time.
The largest group of workers, the data published by Anec, is clearly spoken: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed. The biggest losses in music in major cities have been recorded: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Of the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna lives, who lost 82 singles of music, followed by Toskána (44) and Lombardia (41).
And for them to disappear, the production of multiplexes does not prove anything better than the highest number of music opened in Italy in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of products increased by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of Italian units has increased irradiatedly," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of those who already exist, because when a city music closes, not all of them are willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the unsolicited financial basis for the support of operators: the state's lost assets may amount to around EUR 10 million.
From a ethical and moral point of view, it is also shameful that the government does not comply with the rules in force.
It would take 16-18 million euros a year to maintain the market."
This is the first Italian city where the closures are concerned that, in order to protect and improve foreign and domestic music, the government and the Anec agreement will address the problem.
The provisions would include tax provisions for operators and the benefits offered to the public in order to facilitate the accessibility: viewers can enter the restricted airports and park with a favourable price in certain parking lots.
"This initiative is worth it," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, whether by taking other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional motions to be able to combat the rule of multiplexes must be improved in sound and image quality, as today's public needs are better.
The traditional music collection was always an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Nigeria - where I had spent my childhood and youth - gave me the scar I finally made of the cinema Paradise, although I had spent 10 years on it.
I live in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to Via Nazionale before closing Rialto or Quirinale so I don't see the posters hidden from the door, I'll turn my head.
Serious conflicts between politics and 'dragship' have been held by the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Priomalli clan in the decision-making process."
Serious charges have been brought against Gioia Tauro Mayor and Deputy Mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosario Schiavone Mayor Carlo Martelli, who have been detained this morning on charges of foreign involvement in criminal proceedings.
Bilinks was founded by Gioacchino Piromalli, a leading mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as the same name as the chief lawyers, who were already awarded a bribe for participation in Mafia crime, and suffered EUR 10 million damage.
"Every legal and moral rule has nothing to do with it, which is more of its own taste," the state officials say. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay the consultant's fee to the Priomalli lawyer.
"The clan would have been officially admitted to the city, which would have provided further opportunities for the control and management of the public administration, which could also be said to be important.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabria region's public assembly, does not hide that in the region there are "a number of associations between local institutions and the organised world": there are areas where the spread of mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the concentration is likely to be inevitable.
However, many local politicians are opposed to the 'pressure pressure, those who remain clean'.
This morning's arrests continue on July's events, even when the police announced that they were able to complete the Piromalli clan.
Finally, in April, local politicians were relieved of their responsibility for managing the government. In 1991, Gioia Tauro was once separated from the Committee of Government because of the conditions between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrion, a civil servant of the Christian democracy in the time of exile, was born in the second quarter of 2006.
He issued a contract when the House ordered the separation of the Independent Committee.
The case was brought before the court by the Deputy Minister of Akori, Marco Minninit, and was accused of planning everything for a political purpose, but the court stated in a detention order signed this morning that the Priomalli clan had been involved in following the change in the A3 project.
In contrast with Dal Torrion, the government officials wrote that "it was a great wish to make enough of the demands of companies representing a group which is closely associated with the Priomalli family, to lower their own government's decisions for the benefit of the clans."
The energy comes from my lungs, and now the big ones come
An undiscoverable energy source that makes up 70 percent of the planet's surface and which is now only discovered by large international energy companies
The waves, tides, floods, all renewable energy sources, for which there have been such horrors as Chevron, who are now trying to reach their hands.
For hundreds of years they've been researching how to get energy from the sea's motions. In the '70s, research has grown during the first oil year.
By 1980, when the oil price had dropped, the idea of the use of marine energy had deteriorated, but today the environmental protection needs and the resurgence of oil prices gave new impetus to the industry.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007 estimate, 15 percent of the world’s electricity price needs could be covered by installations that use marine pollution.
This is the sum of doubts about what nuclear instruments are currently facing.
Besides, there's still the goods and the shop.
The horrors are on the ground.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to maritime energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in northern Portugal.
It looked like a reverse step when the signature was signed.
It has been two years since, and it's becoming more and more companies with sea energy, including those who have been traditional energy supporters.
"The Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is taking the opportunity to cooperate with us," said one of the American oil industry's partners, the Wall Street Journal's business journal.
This cooperation concerns the acquisition of the necessary permission for the launch of the basic project for the use of marine energy by the American Energy Agency.
This is not a small matter, especially in view of the ongoing oil production in Alaska in the United States, as President Bush has recently launched a plan for further paintings.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. and the Ocean Power of New Jersey also travel through the sea. The amounts invested, which can already be learned from the details, are evidence of growing interest.
Technology's waiting to be developed.
Experts say that there is still an initial technology in the first place because the energy available from the sea does not share environmental concerns.
The existing installations, such as Portugal or Scotland are both small sizes and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to increase energy production, it is necessary for installations that have a greater environmental impact.
There are several possibilities: for example, the Ocean Power uses an interconnected drilling system.
The readings that have been passed by the tubes and the tubes up to them are produced by the hydraulic pressure of the tubes and pipes in which they are placed.
The pressure is driving a turbine and it's on a generator.
The electric price is going down to the dry ground in the steaming water below the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the design phase, which are already waiting only for federal permission. The energy produced would be used in a military facility.
The Verdant Power, however, has already started power generation for a shopping center and a parking lot using six coastal turbines located on the East River in New York.
The water's movement is going to sell the turbines' leaves, and this movement feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that he has a long list of partners who are awaiting only the energy-use permits.
It's a shopping post-mortem.
There is currently a different focus on options available through the market.
Although it is of age, the price is more predictable than the wind, the day, or the waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other partner countries, spent $7.5 million in 2008, directly for the development of energy from the market. This figure is expected to be 35 million in 2009.
