Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected, under an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members rejected the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison to conclude an invalid priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must be based on the appeal of the defendant in December.
Tymosenko qualified for the political sentence of the regime and brought about a process of suspicion of the court's participation in the west as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
There would have been 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan Won
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As it is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radicals.
The Interim National Council has described the traditional law of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight it is cut off.
Women can forget the emancipation, the non-compliances of their faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will replace the dictator's personality with the company composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya it will rule out such an order that we cannot represent it and that we certainly do not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who was leading the NATO attacks but rather Allah whom they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't part.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our policies were turned away from the dictator as a political alliance without any benefit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not dealing with Libya militaryly.
So there's no problem for locals to get rid of "crossed".
Without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to the Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the accident may eventually result in a disinterested protection of human rights.
Unless we're preventing these lovers from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A turnout of statistics took place on Tuesday in Europe.
Each State has published information on GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has stepped up this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a projected growth of 0.5%, of France of 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed than expected (a 0.3% increase instead of 0.1%), but France had a slight decrease of 0.1% (the question was the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent during the third quarter.
But GDP has slowed down and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that it is leading towards a progressive reduction in economic growth.
The results are higher than the forecast of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has grown by 1.5% during the third quarter but has been stagnant for the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent according to the planned and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what the analysts had foreseen.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 per cent.
The 10-year commitment performance is 28.45 per cent
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is under way to the critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent while the situation prevails in the region.
In Germany , votes are heard to say that the ECB should be the final court guarantee .
Checks are qualified for the EURO.
They won the Montenegrin 1:0 and celebrate the 200 million award
The football representation has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegrin, she also won thanks to the Super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also been highly defended with a good part of the chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a large part of chance for the second part.
The Czech representation has also been gained through the Super Cech and the Heros Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrins were found under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent in the European Championship next year, and more than 200 million crowns will be rewarded in the Czech football box.
From the first minute we played a warball.
The two teams found it difficult to mount combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not been able to perceive the Czech defence that has responded precisely to long shots even during the first half of the period.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They've created a human bugger
Hundreds of high school students have created a human bubble around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this approach to their country's nuclear programme in the face of any Israeli invasion.
The students started praying on Wednesday before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Spanish universities have created a human bubble Tuesday around the Spanish nuclear technology center where uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend their country ' s nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
In Israel there was a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students started praying on Wednesday before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Spain, but also Natanz's site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't take too much lunch and take care of the kitchen for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of those who will go to school with an average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a sick lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment in which human beings and models evolve around it.
On obese children's tables, for example, 50 per cent more often than in children's families with normal weight.
19% of obese had fevers at dinner according to a survey conducted with a sensitization action "Obesity is not a hazard"
In large families sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most of today's schools - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey conducted on 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a hazard", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third are enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes dramatic increase in the number of overweight, obese, is lack of proper nutrition and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned, for example, indicate eating 5 times a day, having a small meal - having lunch - enjoying dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner care
Experts pay attention to the fact that to have healthy development requires some basic details such as a small family lunch at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at my same time.
In most families each takes its own small lunch.
And the worst thing that has been discovered is that one tenth of the population doesn't take any breakfast.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that obese children’s families are more often consumed by sick rats.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drink every day of sugary drinks (70%).
More than 40 per cent of the children interviewed do sport regularly, but for parents it is only 15 per cent.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities offered by their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes are many dishes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, inter alia, a great preference for sugard lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
To eat this is the bread that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not have any wish for follicles and preference for fish and legumes were very low.
No on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a control of a group of participants in the survey that had filled the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obesity is not a hazard", we were faced with a well-determined willingness to guide ourselves towards healthy food," states the results of the survey.
The most significant one was, for example, with regard to sugared lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children usually have white meat on the questionnaire and fish as the main dish and would reduce sugary dishes and "knedliky" (the Czech specialty of bread potatoes or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, saying professionals
In an article on how to learn about the stylists, I was a little angry at the fact that there has been a lot of it since the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The exhibitions of three professionals of specialty, staff skills and a seminar on what is going on.
And that'll be worse.
The closer we get to final exams and the more we wait for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are Saturdays and Sundays courses, it's really "bourished".
This time we have with the director of Alenka (at the time when there is no boy) a deal of how to wear a woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small cut, the other a boy's body, without a special curve, another of the surf.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce large arms, extend a curve or pull necessary curves.
We have thus come to stress well the personality and also not to wear too much of women's types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong furry and long skirts and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and widths of such a way that pockets or pants do not go through everything, that is worth measuring it.
And you won't regret it because the skill that falls inevitably is priceless.
In a jump to measure you feel much better than in the one that swims permanently and doesn't hold on to the centrifuge and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, a Tucker style clothing may be allowed, with short-sighted shirts, or even brothers.
Of course there are many examples of different appearances and I am pleased that I have every week to choose all the information I have received.
But I'm also afraid you're too afraid of what I have to do at home.
Each student gets a celebration to wear for the day and night.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I'm supposed to "habilitate" Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know about Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my heart, this makes me happy because it is better to have Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken nearly a hundred pounds of these last days (don't take my statement, svp, completely on the ground) or even young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and cut from magazines or look online, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of the style is also important.
The stylist not only has physical features but also creates productive pages in magazines (on products that give trends for handbags, handles, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and a graphicist, has enjoyed all of this.
But it's... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialists gave a different aspect at the Saturday meeting full of information on the different types of personnel.
Honza Pokorny, stylelist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphicist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jacub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with one different skill.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like this trunch-coat which has to be wore in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt like a light handle but it can also wear the body no, with scarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to reassess the weaknesses or the neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then begin to confront it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with them, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion gaps.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variety of clothing than those that are photographed.
I mean, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retaliate" at least one fifty.
And also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of our success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna which is not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a global star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylist services is still flexible.
And the famous faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I'll do in the second grade).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability of a completely different size (smaller) than what he actually has.
We then stay on the google and make sure that the information about boulevard is from the celebrity in question, whether it has magri or big...
Honza and Mario asked us on Sunday about the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to collect models.
He has to communicate with people he's dressed and it's so important to be a good psychologist.
To know to become people, not to make mistakes, to keep their opinions.
"When a manager asks you to choose his armor and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, what a horror!"
"You'll find some things you'll find nice and give him advice on what to wear," said Mario.
This showed us exactly what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist bag.
That's what you climb around the size and you're on your own for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as chairs, reels for depilation or yet food pills, there is also the nylon thread (which the stylelist uses for photographing products like bags or hats), special clips with which a suit is closed in the second, if it is too large (the pen or other type of graphing is not useful because they could cover the dress) or well a cover kit.
So that we are not just people who listen but who have tried something practical they have taught us how to properly reflect the shoes.
And during the photo sitting in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could be fed, fortiori to the outside.
And so we picked up and picked up.
We did not have the right to touch the corpses so as not to hurt themselves by inadvertence.
There is therefore a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he made me happy for my creation.
The deal I'm making isn't for my wife's sake.
This is just a little summary of what we've learned during the second week of course
I start more and more to understand that making a profession from styling is not a walk into a rose garden, but everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed Le Run runs across America.
Revision
A free course is initially transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift.
It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run has produced great expectations before its departure.
He promised to take a new direction with the race series Need for Speed already aged and to get out a sort of game from players who would not only deal with points.
So we were curious how the passages are going to be taken during which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole draws to the bottom because of some useless mistakes that have existed for many years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fiction by the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You've been caught in the adventure where the major Jack hero has natural problems and is involved in illegal courses across America.
You sit behind the flightway to the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The workshop is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 courses.
As a result, each course is on another route and the steps set out in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the same instant that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
After all, it's not the end of the world.
But the way through the desert, in autonomous lands or well in highly populated mountains is very pleasantly visible.
Tests are in addition to time enhanced by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful not to fall off an avalanche.
In addition, the different courses are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to overcome the number of opponents asked (as in a classic course) and then run against the display (classic duel with the Chronometer) and then wait another time with an opponent.
From time to time, you also have the police who are involved in the game and who is trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The news is the rides out of the vehicle.
It's an interactive animation instead when most of Jack's time is in front of someone and you need to help him by tapping on the good button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are less times of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is well as this because this element is not likely to generate and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that add to the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is nothing extraordinary at present, but we can't say it's negative.
For realistic simulation you should go see again.
But although it can be found better in competition, the driving model will be very good with the type of design of the courses.
So everything's okay.
The problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collisions are not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game to be complicated and collisions, but when you don't, when you don't have any object collision, the least idea of how your car behaves, then it's not completely good.
During closed crossings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car is part of crazy volts.
Or you'll find yourself in the middle of nowhere.
Thanks to the restart system, this is not really a problem, but it really touches you.
The rebooting is done in such a way that when you cut the figure or you came out of the decor of the game at the time of the last point on the stage.
But you only have 5 re-starts.
When you use the 5 reboots you have to start the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, for if something doesn't happen as it should, it's something you can really count on.
Sometimes retracements do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the timing of the matter.
The main feature of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some widows who have to pass by in some way, but that doesn't happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles today in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute later.
What angers these are situations when you can easily pass the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you need to either turn aside and turn them or freeze them well.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opposers still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that you used to be in the same place.
This generates the most at the end of the game when you run on a long point in reverse.
The enemy must pass at any price before you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in reverse terms and enters a good number of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are fast asleep.
And it's harmful because through a simple behavior model, the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's the same if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the courses is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the course of the courses.
You need to pay attention to the essential pumps on the roads because you can change from car to car, but most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are ideal for cities, the large American cylindricals for the right roads and the super sports cars in exotic surroundings on high-tech roads, for example on ice roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are courses in particular places you know about the adventure, will be very good with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects start to explode:
It connects online with the Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult cuts to understand is the situation of the last race.
You arrive with your car in the Metro tunnel (that looks like) where you run in the darkness on the roads (that looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (at the top) and behind you comes a metro frame that sends you directly to the railway.
In the editorial we had a discussion for a few days to know whether someone really thought about this game or whether the authors really took us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What is more, in more extreme situations, imagination does not have the level and in some cases tragically.
This is particularly true of accidents with a large number of participants when a flood image no longer serves you.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public a new sound track has been created in the "I mix everything" style, but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could tell us without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare you for the mistakes you face with the strength of an airport reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negatists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a long war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players become accustomed to their new role," and Milena Vicenova began her presentation to the University of Law to the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various EU bodies and their relations so understandable and visible that a large number of conferencers from the University of Charles could invite her, she showed how she took her "coherently and openly about Europe" seriously.
Ms. Vicenova thanked Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"In the beginning, he rejected criticism that he was not, that it is a circle of bodies, that he cannot fulfill any mission, and I must say that he's cut the breath across the world because he has a role to play in perfection."
"He is a man who can hear 27 Member States, communicate with them, and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?" as an important step towards the unity and greater flexibility of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrupry (careful pasta that is very strong)
Mrs Vicenova has also made the agenda that she has lived, lived and will live in the near future of the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or well organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of the very negative government and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to Mrs La Ambassador, "activation has struck its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that is still to be resolved.
In addition, the new Union's seventh budget must be approved, which becomes very complex because of the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be small and for economies, which sector will have priority, which countries will at least be helped to solve in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand it is true that in Brussels no one makes rounds or rounds, large bananas, or though no one has forbidden us to make cigarettes."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at a number of paces awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positively.
It is also disappointed to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The failure, she says, results from several factors, such as the delay of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
Another successful Czech Presidency then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, say to me, 'Hey, what are you doing down there, what is still doing this group of Viseggrad?' and it's not of any joy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future there are new strict rules on budgetary policy that are waiting for Member States.
This is the concept of a Europe at two paces, if not at several paces, which is rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institution."
First of all, he said that they cooperate between the countries that want it and those who do not want it to stay in their neighborhood."
"There will be many institutions of this type and there will be a Europe really at two paces," Mrs Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all EU-impact themes should be discussed between all EU members and not just eurozone members.
History of a brand:
IBM's innovation begins in the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the closest to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm sense as very current and yet since its creation it has emerged for hundreds of years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was issued by the first head of the firm, visionist Thomas J. Watson Sr.
It has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved unless people want to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the impression around which the life of a future genius will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived for hundreds of years because it has remained faithful to its basic values and has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"a year later, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmsano.
A well-planned system
Watson, in the 1930s, focused on his employees such as Bata in the Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only ones among the first US employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-designed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way IBM has a well-designed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning of a great discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano to the head of IBM.
It has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently in the position of the Chief of Sales, Marketing and the Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jamy, online brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations have come out.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures its safe position in business.
"From the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Robert Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"The IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is familyly called in the United States, has been looking at its slogan - for hundreds of years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
Of course, this is the most polyvalent technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, services of the Council at the level of the server products up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all U.S. technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings are ticket distributors, payment card, financial swap, bar code or discette.
IBM has recovered this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm according to market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it first exceeds Microsoft in 1996.

These are not all innovations and manufacturings that were preferred by the client and time - IBM for example did not succeed on a own operating system OS/2, Prodigi online or PC PCr:
"From the time your business is built on the move forward you can't be emotionally attached to the past," noted Samuel J. Palmasano.
For this IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don't work it goes.
In the difference, for example, from the Microsoft competitor who holds and stays under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM's income, services, which are designed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a leading role.
However, in 1990 it was with more than the strongest reason for participation in hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during this period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest and even since 2008, when it first passed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the requirements of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased its investment volume during the major economic crisis.
Did IBM now appear to be facing the current crisis without any concern?
Since 2008, the IBM share price has increased by 120 per cent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
That is why we can expect this flexible gene to be master of other crises.
IBM History: From brake cuts to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York hundreds of years ago; it initially had the complex name of Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a subsidiary of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the old "points" pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint embaucha is the head of a competition firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him lead the company.
The leader then left the shadow to the founder of the firm - it's about Watson's ideas that still stand for the identity and culture of society.
Watson runs the firm back in 1952.
IBM, as his name has been said, starts with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - of broths and meat breakers up to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the number of business increased to $9 million and the company expanded throughout the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership he is his son who is in charge of the director's fault, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its IBM, artificial intelligence began to develop and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In the meantime in 1964 IBM develops the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the time computer standard with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but buys the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and starts to deal with advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM over the last three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to use technology intelligently in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
As for IBM trade, there was a short time ago a "Smart Trade" platform that helps businesses manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It created its subsidiary in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Richtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivet you can keep this ring, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became the guardian of the body and loving Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future.
"The Pope may come home, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova lived in Bartosova in the summer, she had no doubt that her husband would not be there.
When Iveta insists on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa does not rest her song.
And he had publicly that he loved her.
With Darina's time she was reappointed, she accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated, there will be no marriage to welcome him on the way to the door of the house.
"It's my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old man, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," she let Richtarova filter by showing that she was divorced from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has established a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'm dealing with repairs, gardens, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together" said Richtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she is going, who she is and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all my responsibility," he concluded.
Women's worst vices: Is this about you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical ways of women, all, like others, are able to get them out of "their weakness".
Dear ladies, you'll find out in the following lines of female veins that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half make comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one suit a week?
Are you happy to buy and buy packages at the time of the sale?
In your case we can talk about purchases like once.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for buying.
But do you say, which would remain in the velvet of clothing stores, to look for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for the entry...
Continual dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to grow up at least five kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"May I please?"
Don't these words remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you're part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of people are allergic because their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women are being harassed.
Odre and purity in the First Place
It's like an infinity manoeuvre.
Wash the windows, walk through the elevator, clean the soil, shower, wash the bathroom - and do so twice a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with his own feet on the ground, to the children that they have pulled out the bathroom, stretched the door of the living room, and what does that give you a lot of work?
In the case of just this obsession, try to have in mind that there is nothing to be excessive and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this inflexible desire of purity can damage your relationship and even family peace.
The work of soap
"But this surveil used in the powder."
"Do you mind putting these old shoes back in the morning?"
"A hired servant has nothing to do with the earth."
If you do this work of sand this way several times a day on your partner, you will really decompose it.
Of course you don't think badly you want everything to be imperceptible.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have done so much work of knowledge...
The diffamation, the persiflation
The diffamination, persiflation, but also the insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly concerned with relationships and are therefore happy to deal with such issues as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us can get a little harmless persiglation out here and there.
However, the hand on the heart is a particular feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, insist on, even offend others and are for their environment - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jör and Voracek helped by their participation in Philadelphia's victory
The attacker Jajr has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again in the head of the Czech players producing for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old Claude Giraux, who took a further step and was appointed the best player of the match, he noted in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jajr also recorded two goals during the match.
JARR, after the match, told coastal journalists that he had warned Giraux that it would be a big evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard him."
"Every time this feeling falls on you," explained Jajr after his Giroux action marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A short time later, there was a second shot from the Czech team.
Voracek fights behind the Huricans' goals for the pallet and presents it to Maxime Talbot butter.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decline, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
In particular to Giraux.
In cooperation with Jajr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the three best," said Jajr about his centre.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockeyjist like him."
"I'm really glad about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jajr added.
Caroline made a play of this game because with a goal of Tuom Rutu and again of Dwyer on a stretch of criminality she ends up with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read didn't differ from other complications that end in two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit on the ball, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to catch him and I got there," describes the last goal of his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory in the head of the East Conference.
The Czech Defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo on the second third due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians did not face an experienced defender of their two goals after a two-fold penalty strike.
Tomas Plekanec has transformed none of their attacks.
This is the fact that the backline was sick, which was mainly empathized with the local coach rather than lost points because they only played the match with 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like this," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement is not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"Our planes just simplify the game, push the ball outside our area."
That's why we had limitations," added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the third Winnipeg attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets' goals, which ended a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sportshurist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at this time offered trips especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crime and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a West-West approach and the trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for socialist citizens (also for Czechoslovakia) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case where the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at this time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to make the night shift with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The deal for the currencies that were the condition for travel to the west was rejected by the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czech currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement ( western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were so many camping houses and chalets that the Czechs were buying and this habit is still hard.
Since 1989 travel in the Czech Republic has been a major revolution.
Although the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the highest until 1989, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of vacation in countries around the world.
The great paradox we have no knowledge today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
The removal of visas in the last century in the neighboring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks were unable to travel by plane to the west for at least one moment.
In Paris, for example, travel organizations slept in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trajectory of a Czech journey was at this time to import its own preserved food, saucesson, etc. to save.
Another important moment has also been the interoperability of the Czech crown that allowed our tourists at the end of the decades to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage has increased what has caused another important moment around 1997.
With an increasing demand for travel travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare rounds with air charter links since 1997 and have greatly reduced costs over the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most of the developed countries around the world, which later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-conflict tourism, when the first air Charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year, direct air charters host Czech tourists in distant hot countries; there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-conflict development took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to participate fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their foreign holidays (50.3%) and for the first time in the history they spent more than 15,000 Koreans per person for foreign holidays, including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this risk of ending up in a situation without a solution "a path"
Less than 5 months ago, the Czech football is without the President and it is at risk that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic's Football Association is not yet known after a General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburg.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules are to be taken.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of the Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure he called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the summer after Hasek the football came back to differences between the Association's rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House in Prague in vain because the negotiations remained blocked, and they were not even asked how to deal with it.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - whether it seemed to be the statutory representatives or also full-powered staff.
There has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, which does not allow full power-based representation.
The differences continue as regards the rule of choice.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pit.
"The debate is based on the following fact: whether to proceed by statute or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, representing the professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the model provided for in the third round of candidates who will have received the highest percentage of votes within the room for which he is invited.
Moravia is ready according to what it has been said to withdraw in order to receive the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of the votes of the two rooms.
And the Czech party studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes cast.
"Only this would lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the objections of the moving party and says that it would be better not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the current statutes.
It is surprising that Thomas Paclik agrees even if he considers that the rule of elections established under the Statutes benefits most from Pelta among all candidates.
"I want it to be voted at least according to the statutes of the association."
"Because there are no safe ideas yet imagined by a representative like during the previous General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was the first candidate and who in his exhibitions was especially defined against Pelta.
The rest of the optimists.
He said there will be a new President in Nymburg and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future as a whole and constructive way.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm the world."
"The football will be again on a happy wave and there will be more training for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer who has the greatest experience in driving the football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends to change the rules for drawing."
"It may again cause a blockade to the General Assembly."
"I hope it's the same reason I'm gonna win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegrin but can say whether the entire football board will be complete for the match.
The specially stolen flight to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucerra and Rajchl, was not disclosed for technical reasons and a variant was sought to lead a part of the Executive Committee on the field of representations.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth and Sports Education, Joseph Dobes, would be very happy to receive the parties removed from the country's most powerful sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of the football as well as the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for President's position because he sees no right candidate.
If the head of Plzen Tomas Paclik footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high role.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motive is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl just to try to prevent Pelta from accessing AFRT's head which would be preferred for this election.
Paclik also stresses that in the event of his election, he would only hold this post of President until 2013 for a General Assembly.
It would be good to see an experienced and high-level manager in the function but who is not connected to the football world.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with the checkball right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, in particular Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the Plzen Roman Berbr football, a man known as the controversial man known in the hills as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta should take this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would last and there would be nothing new in the football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik announced.
What's still shocking is that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any punishment.
"I don't know what Pelta loan would bring to football."
"And how are we going to look at the eyes of the EAFRD and FIFA" this Paclik, who said some time ago "If Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club".
In the case where Paclik would vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended by a fisco, thinks the same thing.
"Pelta would be the first one I'd be with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as the management of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who paid great attention in September when he spoke for the resignation of the Arbitrary Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level of leadership of the Association.
He took as an example his capacity to lead private companies and has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which was held with his support in May last in his first division.
"I have the power to change something in the sports world and bring about a certain culture."
"I would be ashamed of the influence of some interested groups, for example, who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which is causing bad tastes," Paclik added, who does not cover his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, which would allow high-level lobbying power to obtain more money for sport tax on games.
"This is one of the key points which the new President should deal with."
"If this is the tax on gambling as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not take its current link with the Plzen Club as a negative thing even if he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "on top of the parties".
Pelta is again linked to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I see no reason to forward my actions from the Plzen Club to someone if I have to come back one and a half years later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end patent situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end future demands on the electoral system.
Jablonec's staff member is very optimistic before the morning meeting in Nymburg and thinks that today's success in football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election, has just promised to devote herself to national representation and financial means if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the latest just before the General Assembly last two months, and this delay could well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been football for a long time and expect there to be a President tomorrow."
"They feel it's the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association," he adds, but he's primarily linked to the Jablonec Club, has worked for a number of years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
it is also because it has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
It is believed that behind current problems with the election there is a euphoria that ruled in the days of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of Statutes, those who were not as perfect as they were all seen."
"If there had not been all these different interpretations, we would have been a President since September," said Pelta.
It is just the revision of the most important document of the civil society that has taken all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as my personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities of him where he does not go."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he strives not to face his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew, as appropriate, that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not been attacked for a long time by Tonas Paclik who, on the other hand, does not stop criticising Pelta.
"He's been in the football for a year and I've already had some success."
"But their attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also because of what some now have doubts about its character," said Pelta to his opponent, but he remains faithful to his statements made in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from low-level competitions to national representation.
This should be a football win.
"And I would also try to end all affairs that start with that of the Bohamians or follow the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the CTK Press Agency two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the football head would not result in any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said to Strahov where he has been leading a comprehensible nervous system since there is no direction.
Although there have been catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburg for anything.
"If there's only one point of dispute about how to vote on the third round we'll get through it."
"The football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta's optimistic statement two days before the most likely day for his career as an employee.
Rajchl promises that under its direction the AFRT would start working hard.
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is newly elected President of the Association of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not be pleasing to a large number of people, he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wanted systematic changes and made members of the Executive Committee responsible for various football fields.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with EAFRD and FIFA, contribute more money to football and continue the work initiated by President Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football all over it."
"International contacts with EAFRD and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," said Rajchl in a CTK interview.
"I am a team player and I would like to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is involved in a specific area."
"And I'll distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it is about to start working hard rather than criticize others," he added.
It was said that it would not represent itself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the cut and if I have people behind me who will put my boots on my knees and issue doubts about each of my actions," he explained why he was upset.
"Many people have just told me that I don't have to give up because they would also give up."
"This is a confidence I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, it is also said, is to continue the work started with Hasek.
"For the past two years there has been a great work to do and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would just like to stop them." He said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation within the Union does not return as it did before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"He is afraid of people who would make football so that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"A number of things can be appealed to me, but I'm sure I can't support anyone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone in the world will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms that he would only be President of the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one check and the other by which the winners would be back in the first division."
"There would be no situation as at present with only three mobile teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Thomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber who has chosen me his Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl, who is considering among its future success to save tens of millions of Koreans on disadvantage contracts, on contracts with televisions and on the game law.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united is a common fault for all.
While he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent of Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can doubt Plzen has done a great job this year."
"If he had been elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not have made any significant changes among the people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to miss his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A salt in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Oven-optimists, great pools in Budapest: A journey through Europe can live its blue miracle - and after turning around the city or making a long walk - can leave its weary legs in gas pools.
A book shows in which birth pool you can experience most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his bathroom.
Scattered to her back in the water, she observed the artificially arranged couples, and she looked forward to the Putten marbles waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not miss to admire the Art New Metically Restored of these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool was pleasing to him, she soon noticed in her cart all the details of her interest in the type of building and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been searched in this way by the history of Meder architecture and they have been presented in its book already published: "Badefrewreden (Joies du Bain). The municipal swimming pools of Münich, the historical pools in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It carried out its "most exceptional swimming pools in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Along with Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a real fan of bathing culture.
Meder, explain that she has little interest in sports but she has been attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is disturbing that birth supporters should be pleased to observe blue careers and stay at the level of the Javel water while the players breathe perfumes from the fields of epicea or can hear from the delight of wild birds in the park.
"I asked myself one day why the swimming pools must always be if you're hungry," said the venous.
"So I started a collection of nice bathrooms."
Water surface twice strengthens architecture
A swimming pool and volatile sauna oil - well-being factor in birth rooms are enormous because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more punishment, the nesting rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a flat we have a surface of water in the living rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces present in a double way: high-flights, multi-coloured careers, tremples.
The small image volume "Badefreuden" makes a report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of the historical welfare – it certainly wants to make a noise in the blue.
The Meder collection discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
Along with well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrote-containing water in a natural cave in the Karst (Cavern pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as thermal baths filled with water containing alcali and (Városio Termálfürdö in Jásberény) and located in a bottle-form building.
On the other hand, the fully air-filled swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While one of Zürich's swimming pools has all the city in its eyes, we can admire Arlberg enlivened from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish swimming pool is free of a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits the Nagers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal is like an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of the Otztal to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javal water does not eat all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths create a smell of suffering, from the Arpád-Spa in the Bekescsba Hungarian produces a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The scent comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing almost black carbon hydrogen and its lemon binds you to your skin as long as you go swimming in the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also made discoveries: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she was located in front of a baricade area.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed between the time.
Putting an eyebrow through the new-art window in red-white-young, she observed the expansion of the bad trees between the streets.
She observed an opposite effect in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only of the neo-Roman elements that emerged from its design in 1844 but also a poor Alhambra style room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the well-being of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because it is the original of Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance than to create construction styles if different in a unit so awesome," Meder said.
With such a palace, the ceiling in the thermal pool appears to be only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
The German Bank examines in detail the speculation on the first matter
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its speculation on the first material?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to see the consequences.
Hamburg--
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans found it unacceptable that banks specialize in such matters as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the people interviewed also require the German bank and other credit institutions to continue this business venture because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the organization of Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the Speculation of the Bourse on Global First Materials makes prices high and that banks share a complex global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically addressed to the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the view that couples have broken down by offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to the criticism of US competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "No matter what it is worth to have the reputation of the Deutsche Bank played."
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Administrative Board should be presented - with recommendation, usual.
At the end of January, the Chief of Bank will indicate the consequences of the withdrawal.
It could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his Image
The chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new one, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms about the financial sector: "The speculation of the rise in food prices is particularly dramatic, as today's banks are of general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly obliged today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculatives," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr Ackermann asks about the famous people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in play."
Ackermann's conscience may seem surprising at first, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the President of the Governing Council will not change anything within the Governing Council.
It could improve its brand image with a drop of controversial agricultural speculants.
And regarding possible losses, he doesn't want to worry about them - his successor will worry about them.
One of two would resolve the investments on the first materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
Up until now, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted interviews with 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 per cent have found that the Deutsche Bank offers investments for which food prices are paid.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they had learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one of them would resiliate, following the survey, all investments for which money was injected in the specifications on primary materials.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resolution of their account to change bank institutions.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then collapsed.
It is now reopened and has a exhibition home.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangars, living and adhesion and new construction materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the role of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavillon de Schwanzer is also receiving the "Great Prix of Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
The construction is considered to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary house to four cylinders of BMW and its adjoining construction in Munich, it finally became popular at international level in 1973.
Its design as temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Garden of Switzerland at the southern corner of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th-century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - not of walls to further the works of art, so it was not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long as the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has grown more and more.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now transformed the Pavilion, now bearing the name "Maison of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night the Belvedere Museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a moment of chance at all points of view.
The new departure was led by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art history of a considerable career among others in his youth of artistic pathologists, followed by Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, led in particular the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsoring and established the operation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculpture Fritz Wotuba whose foundation bears the same name were presented, a coffee and a library are available, and an office must be built.
Close monitoring, small budget
So for the achievement of Krischanitz was the perfect interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at Vienna Technical University and for him the pavilion was "a very important place" where he had seen the exhibitions " Practically every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness following his move to Vienna and his change in use.
In current transformations, there were major problems: "the building was "an energy gooffrey", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass façade were changed, of the insulation glass reinforced in glass fibers and replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and filled with ammonia coatings were rehabilitated.
Two sub-soils have taken place in the new operation, a light panel sealed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new building, but still reading Pavillon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a protective tent against the red-brown color wheel.
And the cinema room is just exactly the same as it was sometimes.
And all of this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Many of the materials that were good and less expensive were to be found, and that also appealed to the monumental protection office," Kristchanitz said and he drew attention to a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remains simple and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "who came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and however it wants to "be alert to good conscience".
But in this case, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because it is a city building chance: around the Garden Switzerland is just the "Central Park Square" ever planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the strengthening of another Kristchanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlinian Temporal Art Centre, and as he says, she already negotiates with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn is planning a sudden winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid winter train accidents.
The number of salaries should double.
That's the cost of millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn railway company will spend more than 70 million additional passengers this year.
The daily "Build"-Zeitung reported to the front by calling for an internal crisis plan to the group, which investments of around 300 million euros would be planned by 2015.
This should also improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks in the event of extreme temperatures.
The number of internal and external salaries for the destruction of railway facilities and which should be doubled and passed to 16,000 persons.
The objective is to detach between snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Chief of Rüdiger Grube station maintained the government and industry during a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
The last winter, the railway company has had enormous problems for the transport of users, as it lacks other reservations in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is also true of many new regional trains which have been authorised by the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing this for years, since it has had to check the ICE train axles more often at the workshop after a break of the axles took place on an ICE at the central railway station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines to the United States.
After the case of Chief Joseph Ackermann there is a new US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a million-dollar fine.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this sector-wide generation is more than the United States: Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million), to settle a difference due to the failure of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage documents.
The regulator of the NCUA financial markets carries to large banks a range of charges, and this would have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied to have found a solution to this issue, without the parties agreeing to a court procedure," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has recognized no fault in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying an amount of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the concessions from the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. co-operational banks and intervenes in case of failure to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator has also taken other large banks in part and has appointed him before JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securitys".
The credit houses are based on it.
When the U.S. real estate bull emerged in 2007, Ceci was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. Lehman Brothers Investment Bank collapsed.
Although events have been taking place for a few years now, he is currently breathing a storm on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried many remedies to obtain compensation or to punish shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It appeals to 18 major international banks, to the two US state-owned financials Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac to benefit in nature from some $200 billion mortgages.
The Deutsche Bank must also submit an appeal to the FHFA, which includes several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurt respond to "substantial losses" but not to mention a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected requests as unjustifiable and declared its intention to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett's 10 billion increase in IBM
Buffett, the financial gourer, invests colossal sums in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the American major investor Warren Buffett explains without delay that it does not invest in IT IT IT IT IT IT IT, since the long-term evolution of companies appears to be only bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM is offering services and information systems for other companies' IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be an attack on horses in the financial world.
The IBM TI activity therefore grants the right to call itself "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett has today revealed to the economic emissions of CNBC, which he has bought since March of IBM shares of $10.7 billion.
Her investment holding company Berkshire Hataway has thus become a large IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM never had anything to do with this commitment until now.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has for a while been focusing on IT lucrative services as an exploitation of accounting centres.
The information pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultation as well as very efficient business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
On the contrary, Buffett attacks rather than on railway colds, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hataway has about 80 branches as well as parties to a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municipal Rück.
This 81-year-old octogene had recovered in the 1960s the small Berkshire Hataway textile company and raised it to one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, her lifestyle is modest.
That's why it's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His sense of failure to win money has been worth the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM's actions increased by one percent at the turn.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a gross value of over $220 billion and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft's house, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate there.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media question the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blooding ideology" that would renegotiate now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 were extremely extreme.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkey population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turkeys the spectrum that has been believed to be dead for a long time has re-appeared: since Mölln's fire attacks in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence compared with this extreme legal context against the Turks.
There was a henophobia in Germany, however, it has never been asked.
However, the extremist right network that has been detected reveals the proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"This is a return to the bleeding ideology," "That was the title of the online appearance of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper points out that one of the authors would have been a v-human of the Constitution's Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bourgeoisie.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany responded: it called this weekend a silent reminder of victims of racial violence at Brandeburg port.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had been thinking of a 50th anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
It's with nice colors that the co-dwelling had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have an effect: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of deaths.
Also, the German formation of the "Hurriyet" does not require it to be removed from unique conditions.
"this starts to dawn," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been killed, would have paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The police action was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkey forums and they had then discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain areas of extreme law, the authors are surprised.
More than one stands ready at least for drastic rhetorical means: "If the matter continues to be closed, it will remain for migrants nothing but self-defence and arms."
"this will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means is if internal peace in Germany is at risk, Mölln and Solingen's attacks in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the destructions after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what the lack of confidence and distance from violence could result.
However, the attacks corrected our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
At other times, it is particularly the failure of German policy after the attacks by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, representing the funerals in Cologne by his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was in his speech at the time, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax duties.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once more how much the lack of many German-Turcs has been deep in the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reassess extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Zürich Lake Channel Bank
The most adventurous European Bank is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and is suffering from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to run now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its show-up from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that it would take almost a spectacular job in 2013: President of the Swiss Bank's Board of Administration - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly happy, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recent stability and made warm comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has won the Turnaround."
"I enjoy working with Kaspar Villager and Oswald Grübel."
However, since September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities market in London had broken down all the Bank's security systems and had flown around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of UBS management board Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the UBS Board of Administration has since been considered a sufferer - and all ask: When does Axel Weber return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank since February 2012.
And he will resume the administration's presidency in May - not in 2013, as he informed the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
It is not banking, much more economic teacher and bank president, and it would certainly need a period of adjustment.
Once again it assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has proved once more that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe's scandalous market".
In fact, UBS is on a huge side - so far it has been the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it has been suffering for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, doesn't save her high Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, quiet and solid, but also Russian, has combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So UBS would manage one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy client than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's largest banks.
That impressed me.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask ourselves, how could I simply be mistaken at this point?"
He's been deeply deceived.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something was not going around UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which had so far been regarded as a highly intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later we published the reasons why he was involved.
The Bank's division had been flammable with sub-primary documents and had to cross over billions.
To this end, UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and made a crossover.
For this, it has actually found investors, but soon before, it would have faced the sources: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed under silence, where it has never even been learned its name.
That was only the first time.
In April 2008, that was over.
The Bank had to re-announce losses of billions, the President of the Board of Administrative Marcel Ospel, who was still the second Board of Administrative Board the best payout in Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was found, taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the disaster and had been saved by the State.
The National Bank has acquired UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation has provided six billion francs for debt convertibles into shares for which it could be co-ownership of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shut down - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country to open up its large banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the banker, Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
A few months ago, UBS had been captivated by a tax difference with the United States and was ready to publish the customer's data, which may have corrupted the tax with the Bank's help.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - reimbursing unlawful benefits from these operations with an increased amount.
Thus the UBS has published more or less than it has helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
He followed the resignation of the Head of the Board of Administrative and Chairman of the Board of Administrative Boards.
And from the customer's money issue.
The bank thus lost its credibility in the two main business sectors for a few months: bank investment due to poor specifications and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a little bit of a return to peace, and as we thought, the UBS would come out, he followed this unfortunate story of titled goods: a single brand of flamebwe 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something would not turn around.
And it's published: with risk management in investment bank it doesn't always seem to work.
"In the case of Adoboli, we have been able to see that the risk master is too small to change," said Martin Janssen, economist and financial teacher at the University of Zurich bank.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long taken their role, that of becoming a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too high a risk, but security for money - and the world could well sink beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of unprecedented reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich will still be paired with the strong click of the private Swiss bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central port of Zurich, which leads directly from the central port to the lake of Zurich, which is surrounded by torrential summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the store houses are among the highest in Europe.
Bijots like Tiffany's are found here between Swiss traditions stores and those of the Sprüngli Conseries.
Since the centuries of Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the palace of the Swiss Credit to private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance hall with a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, where there are thick leather sheets, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another different from the market - or I have brought the two large Swiss banks, UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a Swiss private bank.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, as all Swiss bankers do business with the two large banks.
The UBS would become too large, it would be found - especially in banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would be in additional returns.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And at the same time, they have long been adapted to the deaths of the Anglo-Saxon."
This has been done by the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank which has changed the UBS, has benefited greatly and then declined: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-primary ring as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster occurred on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the small country's government coalition to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "The Crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the political men agreed to rescue the large bank from failure.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially to the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for the little Switzerland - and recorded an increase without delay.
What has helped is that the two different pre-exceeding banks of the UBS have completed: a rich but in litergy with a strong asset management point in Zurich and a more poor but more strongly internationalized.
At the same time, international investment banks have had access to a lot of money, with which they could turn into a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with BBC's Ascension: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 Chief of the BB's Group, and Marcel Ospel, also president of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said banker Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitous, who has lost a path until it reaches its peak with bank learning."
But Ospel would be trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive error at last: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word: detonator Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at this time documented the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to mount everything up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of securities and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, business counsellors, who were responsible for it, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" banker jargon, there would be a huge difference between the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings at the level of U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS launched an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
As part of growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund established before it in the US sub-primary investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgage loans - but also saved risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said the bank expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria is the greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to start, when we put an end to the attempts, it became more difficult than we thought.
Posts at BB have become eligible and are to date available in banks.
The one who runs the big bank has a almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be actively involved, as it is clear to date.
The next day the bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian was only supposed to be a transitional when the bank suddenly broke apart from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has been imposed: it must carry out UBS's business continuously, and the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the 1990s.
It's 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want from money with?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber must have asked himself.
He said publicly until now he was only going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe pushes on the American bourgeois
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has deduced US investors.

American investors expressed themselves sceptically: "We are not an island, contrary to its dependant," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there will also be other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett just confirmed this caution: "It is still unclear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in obligations from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw an old principle into the market for several decades and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion to IBM supported the course of the traditional group's actions, and allowed it to report almost 1 per cent against the trend in commercial management.

Intelligent corals thrive in cities
In many places, flies are considered "flying problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer allowed to flee cities for a long time.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. Cornels belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the salinity and noise of animals.
An antidote to "the problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
In the first ostfriesich symposium on the corneals, experts said that it is no longer possible to cast the flowers of the cities.
Experts from all Germany have dealt with possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities
The protection of nature was also based on the exodus of particularly protected streams: the use of chemicals in agriculture further destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, management and cutting of typical cotton trees made life difficult for birds.
Cornels are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of coves in the Westfälische Soest, in the north-west of which are Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the massacre of coral reefs in the region.
Critics have found catch of birds in pieces and their killings with particularly brutal gordins.
"The normal eviction, the adventure, is nothing," noted the planner of the city and landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests by under-pressure or by cutting down trees often results in disastrous consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies divide and scatter in other places."
The event is only imaginary in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer end them."
The problem is not resolved in cities without the inclusion of the peripheral, according to the opinion of Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is designed to combine the disposal of animals to an aversive condition and attractive offers to allow them to be re-installed.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens looked at "the information panels at the throne" in order to establish a completely different relationship with them: "We can finally support a button on the face with a dose of confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Education-Educational Corbeles in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very intelligent breezes.
This project has been adopted by tourists from time to time.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "That's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Frauds not only use instruments of work to reach a gift but they themselves manufacture their tools as tools of work.
Cambridge University ethologists have been testing four flies recently, to what extent bird intelligence is achieved.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to crawl out with stones in order to reach a larynx.
Without much training, they were determined to recognize that a stone had to have certain sizes and shape in order to smooth out the platform.
In a second test, astute corneals then had to solve a later problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, researchers had placed a small hole with a larynx.
Birds couldn't reach their nest with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the little fish of the little cucumber.
Three of the four brakes have been successful since the beginning.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, is planning to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (EUR 1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees as a result," announced PDG Bill McDermott to its customers on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The effect will grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 of the 176,000 global customers of SAP are located in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase business figures by EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, Walldorfer recorded a income of nearly EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the management of software provider's business, which employs 55,000 people, has never been well marketed.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The impact of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Chagrin: an intimate history of World War I), it begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
A tip to start: carefully delete this page and make your brand-page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Roman novel by Peter Englund, this list of people will be your GPS, a ball during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and disappointed in the outbreaks of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the community that he described, with accuracy, as "an anti-historic work."
It contains some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials is found.
This is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that "a book describing what this might look like." It contains the "expressions, impressions, experiences and humors."
"The beauty and joy" summarizes the experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women in war, both sides of the war, young and botanists on stairs, passing by doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, become insane or lose their lives.
Their lives hang here like the graves of a church: while some are falling apart, we light up new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional historical books.
It demeans the idea that World War I is only a summary of the terrible war on the western front.
"The beauty and the chagrin" is well described by other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under shots; the Christmas pass in Egypt under pyramids; the so-called mussels are an intrepid problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war engulfs the lives of these people is a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina that can heal.
When canon cuts are held far away, and you're a mother at home, you're staying or you're running away?
Who'll come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what has happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been overcome by suspicions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and novels."
"Beauty and Chagrin" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumff, a young seaman from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives may be terrifying or passionate, but they are more preserved by the accumulation of isolated moments and details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out.
Describing the history of a German school, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere else."
"Coffee replacement coffee, false aluminium, casing imitation, paper bags, wooden buttons."
It continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "wine made of cooked rice dried in cotton fat (and ends with a false ox of wood); the tobacco made with dried roots and dried skin of soil powder; the seeds of wild boars."
He states that "837 authorised replacement meat are recorded in the production of sauces, and 511 replacement coffee is also available."
Some stories approach honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulse towards the wild and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, instead of sitting in a comfortable suitcase, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-selling, and rather than claiming that such a war is a symbol of civilization, and that there is no barbarous behind your banned and closed shirt.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When it's meant to sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is comparable to "a man who is convicted in secret".
Other comments are about the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He comes from what he calls "a new species within the animal of the beginning of the century: the well-arranged mass murder and ideologically convinced, in well-dressed clothes, that executes its mouth while sitting behind a counter."
People act in unexpected ways; both basic and heroic behaviors are found.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at any price to catch a vendetta in women to avoid service in front of them.
"The most grotesque expression in Gonorrhey's trade is found that soldiers buy and rely on the genital organs in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which is translated by a life-threatening curiosity."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's process is simple but non-obstentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In decades of short-term scenarios, he learned the way the war has "disappeared from uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, a religious revolution."
People start to wonder why their leaders make war on them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarkque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most accommodating thing I've ever read in a non-fictional work.
I wouldn't reveal it.
But it's as if it came out of his book, take this page from your hand where it lists people and burns with a light.
After a first step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some carrying anti-emerging cases.
Monday night on Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most lively.
The operation is kept secret from all threats by several high-level officers and other reports from the beginning of their exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges of the police department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of gas against protesters, which have been opposed to the department's regulation and have led to a threat of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the decommissioning of employment in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, for operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against embezzlement - anti-terrorist measures that are rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan in the East River.
The orders for moving into the park have arrived "in the last minute " , said a habit, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise " .
"The few policemen I knew and who were called did not know that they would return to Zuccotti Park," said the anonymous person.
"The only thing to know is that they'll be back at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has a lesson to learn from where the operation's secret is.
On October 14th, the police wanted to clean the park, but hundreds of protesters reported the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district - dozens of officers from particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, as migrants. So one hour of the morning was a good time.
"It was supposed to be done when the park counted at least people," he said.
Emergency services equipped with spot and speaker equipment gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before taking action.
The lights and messages from the speakers seemed to frighten the protesters.
While community business officers were in the park equipped with their clear blue-air cuts, many protesters simply collected their business and were involved.
No attempt was made before 1h45, which allowed the police time to gather their business.
Other police teams were visited on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman of the Chief of Police Department, said that this measure had been taken only by security.
But after many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, strictly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the vast business portfolios of protesters, including baggage, plastic gas and pockets of clothing filled with sheets of clothes, the cleaning department teams followed, cleaning everything that was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were trained. Images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the campsite's kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier which the police have moved to stop methically.
A dozen people who were at the epicenter of the camp were gathered together.
Finally, two people were caught in trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
the majority for " public order trouble and rebellion ".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most ranked officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although currently "did not direct operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patients along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, where necessary.
Baricadas were placed on Cortlandt Street, a petal of houses in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, most of the crew of bullies, would have even been seen moving people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most alive actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protesters jumped over the head of a police car. Others were shown to cover the tires of a police truck.
At one point, an opponent's boat emerged flying out of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrators were hospitalized.
School Aid Union continues the city for licensing
The union that represents hundreds of school aid having lost their employment in the last month is planning to attempt Wednesday a trial in the city for useless and discriminatory licensing. The impact is disproportionate to schools hosting disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the final weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to attempt to cancel the licensing.
Six hundred and sixty-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees, part of the least paid out of the city, lost their employment on 7 October last. The union leaders compared these licences to a political fine so that the city did not have access to a health care fund directed by the working groups, which would have allowed the budget gap to be closed in the last spring.
Municipal authorities have not categorized this charge.
In a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the licences were part of the June budget.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the school aid licences were not specified in the budget.
Officials of the 37th District Council stated that they would fill out a claim notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be the defence party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or Latin-American colors, like most of the school aids that lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the city's legal department, said that the municipality had not been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a survey of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would issue a number of licences in the schools of the city's most disadvantaged districts to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose most of their aid due to regular sub-financing.
While there is no licensing on Staten Island, and some were punished in the facilities of Upper East Side or TribeCa, 17 school aids lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five school aids on eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of the students live in poverty, the prosecution claims that "It is not a simple parent village that can raise funds to meet the budget deficit."
The public school's 36 budget has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The union also claims that the school directors have been mistaken in some terms in a memo authorising parental coordinators' licenses.
The memo used the term "extraordinary" to describe the action, even though "extraordinary" generally described the action to move a teacher from school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "six-six coordinators of parents were licensed", and "not only because of excess".
Mission Completed: Congress finds an agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had found an agreement in the Chapter on the issue of education in Libya.
There will be a successful settlement, the capture and death of long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations will have to take a next Tuesday decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republic - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Republic - Connecticut), hailing the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "religion".
"This resolution is to respect the courage of the Libyans as they start rebuilding their country," said John Kerry.
"It's a part of their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
In this context, legislators of the two parties have entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was won by a broad bipartisan margin and never made a vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day as the failure of the draft law, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.
Thus, the American mission remains under a legislative purgator - Congress is opposed enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The decision of the Congress was exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Kaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Committee ' s resolution on Foreign Relations "blesss the Libyan people for their courage and outstanding determination for freedom" and "blesss the men and women of American armed forces and their partners of the coalition committed to military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the United States' national interest in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure succeed in all the support of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs or will it divide legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the last version of a new project.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week for an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of the Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure supported by the Republican Bob Goodlette (Virginia) will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a vote to appeal to the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The amendment of Goodlate is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to Congress on a wide range of issues.
Some are frequent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from one previous.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another item that would "control federal expenditure " .
Some of these draft laws are identical, but they support them - including the new Republicans who wish to lose their CV - the chance of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Act on Budgetary Control (Budget Control Act) adopted last August required the House and Senate vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrate - New York) wants to take up the two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a variety of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other things.
An amendment banning the marriage of individuals of the same sex is proposed on a continuous basis, as is the amendment prohibiting the propagation of the rod.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed.
As soon as they have been members of the amendment, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The deadline is slowed down in the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not Battué" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first interview from the shooting
Ten months after an armed man pulled him up to Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, singing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to come back instead of return to Congress.
When she appeared in the "20/20" TV newspaper on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The emission approached its difficult return to the ball that broke its skull and hit the left side of the brain through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first interview on television since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified for his "hard" recovery.
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords answered "very well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", published the watch for the release of the new book "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special issue has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the 8th of January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was shown on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on the front.
She comes to use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the liver.
And finally, his first word is "Whoi."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords added another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu for her breakfast.
Videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: is the representative presenting with doctors singing with Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wwana Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin".
During his interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said not to remember the fossil.
According to her husband, she was reading an article about the shooting of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six people killed in the accident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and has been severely treated while waiting for the trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Stop, stop, stop."
On his return, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been beaten."
"So I'd say, " Gabby, you didn't fight," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out, get back and get back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for vets without a home in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance about pressure, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-cravate stood up at his feet to pick it up.
"Military, men and women are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund collection.
A military high-level presence in the Galápaga, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, the head of the U.S. army chief, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a sort of orphelin," wrote the military high grade in an electronic e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that wasn't respect.
The totally contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate American public but often far away.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some soldiers say.
The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to get sick in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognised or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of Vietnam's warring troops has been much worse.
Thus, most of the interviews on mercy took place in all privacy among the veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would respect them because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant conflicts.
Others would wonder if "a veteran angry and violent hiding under the surface " said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work with the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who had done his job asked him in a subtle way whether he would be able to cope with the stress of a job requiring Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"When you address the issue of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalled Colonel Cancian when he spoke to his sons.
The military difficulties arise, in part, from the American independence in wars.
Winners are rarely welcomed by such a small country with the army, which sees little direct benefits of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value the heroism of the same way as for the Second World War " says Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognised for the number of periods of service, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to serve against the violent
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will take action against the army for alleged violence.
If so, hundreds of complaints will be prepared next time.
The 1st grade soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks old at night when she said she had been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She went back to her casino to Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having met a friend when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could meet her in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was a warning signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas is worried.
I thought: no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after she entered Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her back, kicked her out of the ground and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still serving and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice during a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial carried out against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of military violence, thus contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by military colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, pursued or provided justice adapted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to take it to the Galonian soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals instead of eradicating the culture of reflection? The leaders."
The lawyer also stated that since February it has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all complaints in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same panel - will try several processes, if necessary, to keep pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek detail the strategy of defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries caused by active personnel.
" The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women have not yet officially the right to go to war, this distinction is only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result: in these two wars, 150 military women lost their lives - two thirds in a battle situation.
It's time for the army to modernize themselves to declare Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other processes are in progress.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre is preparing a case against the four major military teams to have themselves to encourage a mystical environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing an army process, focusing on the diagnosis of " personality problems " assigned to victims of violence in order to give up - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group sought a process in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with applications for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bill projects were presented to the Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering different solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered under the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. In fact, according to the very estimates of the Pentagon, this figure is about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases recorded in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants of Susan Burke's case described their aggression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the violence less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report in detail her rape to various police, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a kite of violence), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting in front of a judge, during a trial in which she was asked about her sexual relationship with her little friend earlier on the day of her aggression.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality to the author of the crime, who ended up being held in custody.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I think I'm going to start having contracts.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander "It wasn't his process but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making it inappropriate for the service.
In January 2010, it was sent under less than honorable terms, preventing any advantage from being received.
Is Lyman and the other complainants going to make progress or not, is a long story, John Turley, professor of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is located decades ago because it does not have the same advantages and means of dissuasiveness as the responsibility.
"The chances are heavy on them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other complaints for other proceedings.
"We will continue to fight the army against this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Wherever we die, one or two of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Brevik was a simple guy who was part of his online anti-immigrance opinions.
Monday, Brevik, who admitted to having been taken from a death march in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Brevik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extremist groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published by the DEMOS reflection group on digital population in Europe.
Facebook is based on so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members were members of extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an investigation. The issues were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people with Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to ask 10,000 participants from 14 extreme parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: online right groups are rather men, young people and anti-immigrants.
Surprisingly, however, "those who engage in online and offline activities are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new incontestable tool among scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study all health issues such as social trends, thanks to "J'ame", publications on walls and updated statistics.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates a research explosion, increasing the number of research works on which the site's name appears in almost 800 per cent over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you cannot approach in the street.
"In the past, when you tried to investigate people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their farming exploits had far more opportunities to be alcoholic than the students were aware of.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would be too often about alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnosis it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the health, behaviour and development centre of children at the Institute of Children's Research in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, which would otherwise be unrecognised."
Facebook also regularly accesss information from its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on the love situation and the day of Saint Valentin, the 2010 mid-mandate election participation rate and a national happiness index (only available - digital freedom campaigns have long held that the site could make its data available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - instead of being able to play on Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"Although they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two things completely different," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a note and style remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are intended to address the social aspect - and social, this is not before a computer."
"Froid and inhuman" : first comparison by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two deaths in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "of resistance" during his first appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explained before a 500-person hearing room.
"As regards the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it because you have your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports pluralism."
"I recognized the facts, but I don't ask you to marry."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during this monologue because "he didn't want to let him use this process to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Brevik, who brought with him a paper speech, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Brevik in custody for more than two weeks, forbade him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking at Brevik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing to see the end of the process.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian NRK television channel.
"I wasn't easy, but I personally made some progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a shade suit and a blue tie, Brevik remained calm and professional throughout the process. He looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Brevik is a broad "resistance" movement, the judge has determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he has dealt with complications.
Thus, the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may bring some comfort.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by all nations.
"I'd prefer it to look like a monster, but it's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs lost interview, this week's film
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern information.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently discovered Steve Jobs entertainment that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on major markets is how this creative spirit included the processes and workflows of products.
There was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very mechanical and organized, as well as an organizer of organizations - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "sickness that they thought a great 90% idea of work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a generic idea of an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the computer's birth, and he spent more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At the time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT IT company, looking at a popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the realiser's garage.
This video, slightly remounted, is based on the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released on Wednesday and next Thursday.
For someone to know how to hate deep entertainment, Steve Jobs seems to be excited here to expose technological philosophies and their commercial strategies.
And Incrediblely careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly puts his thoughts in order to provide a precise answer.
We will also find out when Steve Jobs' perfectionism is resurrected, where he seems eager to understand Cringely's issues, giving him cuts to speed it up and move to more important issues or issues.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there is an unusual aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers to be good or bad in other companies and is part of his own vision of the future of the information.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something awful and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream of watching the size.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
Then he tells them how to implement them.
Here's a quick recapitulative of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to run a business:
"For all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them."
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to give details of his efforts to simplify accountability at Apple.
Perplexe on how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - developed an automated factory that guaranteed the exact calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdotes of the "Blue Box" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack the telephone networks and call free distance.
The device has made many letters to the front, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an appropriate act is infectious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, then through an appeal from an AT&T network to another while surrounded by as many satellites as possible.
"We're engaged in a bunch of different things a half-twenty times and you're on the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the public phone on the side," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know a great thing both of us, but we had a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have a day without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell about a wonderful tour he and Wozniak made: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, passing by for Henry Kissinger and asked the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two complexes start laughing just before the Pope himself is revealed.
On his love with technology (and driving by Bill Hewlett):
When he is 12 years old, when he falls into broken pieces to make a frequency meter, he searches Bill Hewlett's number in the year and gives him a piece of thread.
After their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I've seen at this age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs became one of the HP employees visiting the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first computer of the never designed office."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
On several occasions in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products on a headcut.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell some printed circuits cards, a customer asks him to collect a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and the delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was raised up saying I would need five years [to make a sister who would cost $300]. I've had enough, I've gone out and I've been going to see a designer."
Twenty-ten days later, we had a sister we could make for $15 that would have been incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are:
As soon as it did not make Apple alive, Steve Jobs had foreseen how many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's let you work at IBM or Xerox, make you a better copyr or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopoly, so the company will no longer succeed.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [this is the type of persons] who end up leading the companies and the staff involved in the product are excluded from decision-making.
The product gene that led to this monopole position is fully capable of people who cannot imagine design a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have stopped all the computer industry.
She could have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft of the '90s...
They've made the mistake of winning.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are commitments to do... Some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is to try to expose you to the best products created by men and try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that good artists are cheating and that great artists want.
We're always ashamed to want excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people working on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just had the best computer sciences in the world.
If this were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are dealing with health rights opponents while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court met at eight o'clock to consider the issue of political dispute, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the court of lawyers who would defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was a process undertaken by 26 States protesting the reform of the Ambitious Health Cares voted by Congress last year, a law that was a point of reference for conserving soldiers at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a 530-minute monumental argument was expected in March, and the result will probably be of a nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential course, which will be in full force at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a general applicant for the United States during George W. Bush's administration.
The Legal Office of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of two dozen cabinets that have helped to prepare the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that hosted dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical gene Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the trial.
Among other things, there was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican of the Senate and a declared enemy of the Health Act.
Do you see the guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing else against the rules of deontology.
In fact, judges are exempted from code of conduct which governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend the collection of funds of organizations related to law and others although the judge may not be an intervention, an invitation to honour, or a statement on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the cases lawyers' offices, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is enough to alert government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and great independence of the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and attending a collection of Gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund collection of this event makes any claim for impartiality unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little concern for criticism that they are too easy to mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative soldier.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the Court of First Instance.
Her criticisms forced Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she was too invested in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Emirates Air Company orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-couliers line planes, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
This is all the case when the company is the builder of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the total record of $18 billion.
It's also amazing who Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the plans published on Monday, the company of Chicago estimates that the air companies in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend-end, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colouraires.
It is the air company Emirates based in Dubai who passed this Pharaohonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airport that the airline is also able to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that deals with important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is worth more than a billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil producers have many of their airlines.
So they have not only the means to pay these flights, but a amount of the fuel price - which is harmful to air companies because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful as the country would earn money with the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or separate their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, reported Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command strengthens Boeing's predominance on the market of major-porting aircraft and helps bridge the airbus competition attempt with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Hall comes four months after Airbus' announcement to report the beginnings of the largest A350 version, which is directly related to Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus postponed its efforts to increase pressure following the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's actions have increased by 1.5 per cent to US$ 67.94.
Mexico's President's sister publicly fighting the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug dealers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of PRI in the course of the government post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her attempts to access the role of the governor of Michocán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers had favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the course at the position of Governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact not only for Michocán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they got rid of urine, they installed road barriers... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI has ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the fall of the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michocán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was head of polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who is currently occupying the functions of the governor, has arrived thirdly, a criminal failure before the 2012 presidents for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Valejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has lost all contact with drug traffickers and has strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michocán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the traffic of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michocán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was killed while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michocán elections have air, a winner will help the party in its role.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, has congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of the coming year."
The PSD strongly encourages Asia to come to aid the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BSD based in Manila, stated that the two economic powers of the fastest growth in the world should "do everything they can" to speed up the recovery of the monetary area by means of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "independent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support by European leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore, whoever can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it's not open."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been severely hit by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italy's loan is dangerously high and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe highlighted the fear that the global economy will not go into recession, and called on the major emerging economies to meet together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag stressed that the IMF would provide all Asian assistance, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the U.S. financial savings fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, Minister of Trade and the Indian Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a delay in foreign capital gains.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and rigid," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help Europeans while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to accept European aid to 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800 000 live with $2 a day, less.
"One day they will find out that the Greeks will retire for 50 years and that they will leave on vacation in the sun and they will have the evil to learn," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in mismanaged jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis was likely to cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The UNDP forecast of a 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "lost risks" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed "suspend plans" to protect themselves from economic return and significant capital losses.
Important warnings from the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary for Defence, Leon Panetta, has put pressure on Monday's Congress, warning that the imminent automatic budgetary pressures were known to national security. He has launched a financial response to the Pentagonian colour chain in Afghanistan's battlefields through civilian collections.
The Pentagon has already estimated $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but it is now feared that an additional amount of $600 or more would be imminent if the Congress did not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arisona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called sequestration would result in 23 per cent of reductions as well as many new projects.
"A very important reduction, applied without any discernment, would make most of our ships and our non-executive construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously affect other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We are also obliged to separate ourselves from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians away without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military forces and seriously undermine our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the financing of foreign contingent accounts during the war is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contractual staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the monitoring of contracts supporting the war."
"The wage management staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have led to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's inconsistencies of military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this dramatic action," the senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and that is certainly not what we should impose."
"Sacrement is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be produced."
That Panetta's letter and recent warnings of senators increase pressure for a budgetary compromise or call for exemption from the cut-off Pentagon remains to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more violent with regard to possible compressions, even though he has reached his own highest position in the Pentagon, culminating in years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark table of what could happen - a military with a coquill, but not a knot.
"It's a ship without marines."
"It's a ballless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of castles, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically described how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and commit ourselves in the world; and unacceptable risks in future combat operations".
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defence projects could be taken over, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new liturgical battleship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the sea.
The F35 development and testing could generate $80 billion savings over 10 years, but its participants say it is an essential step in improving and responding to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to identify a liar
A look at the recent shortcomings indicates the extent to which fraud and lie are common in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to President Herman Cain is engaged in exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with fraud in order to deliberately cover reports that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and confused countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the popularity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has become an idiot by quickly exposing the contradictions of irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edwards was charged with violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extraconjugal link.
And then, no one who has lived the story will never forget the media circle that President Bill Clinton has launched in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Trichery records at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students to see their performance assessments.
Men who should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and lie are acceptable.
How many drummers do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are false lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society like, say, characters, where the goal is to write: "I've had you", the detection of fraud is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have led to a thorough research of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
Lies look at you in the eyes.
They don't get rich, they don't rediscover or they don't always get involved.
Do not conclude that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to disassemble.
A qualified liar can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerges from knowledge of the trumpet, and it is clear that the detection of the trumpet is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include building, interviewing, negotiation or management.
Good liars are able to read well to others by putting them in the easy way by managing their own emotions and intuitionally detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraterrestrials lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than those who are not married (but the lies they tell have a tendency to be enormous).
We also know that if you understand it as a magician, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if you have a mind?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we're calling "to set the data back."
This helps provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch your subject, smile, voice quality.
You need to know if someone usually reimburses his feet permanently so as not to launch unjust accusations when you see him reimburse his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for misleading, verbal and non-verbal codes of conduct.
Consider these indicators as red tapes, not evidence of fraud.
Smuggling people can build up the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, think about an exit, change their position in a significant way or present a "post-interview" relief - an exhilarating sigh of relief, a change of post when all difficult questions are passed.
Questionnaires often say falsely that maintenance is done just to try to slow down the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson was disappointed with the past by claiming that his murdered wife was alive, starting a national search to find it.
Individuals who cheat can also use a remote language: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or have a difficult question.
The most common verb indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wine language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember my property... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive answer rather than fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding the victimization by drug addicts in their professional and personal lives.
The contested oil plan will be triggered after the United States' late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing the anger of trade unions while alarming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline said it was ready to redirect the project to return it to the railways.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the pipeline project outside the ecologically sensitive area of Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says that the company remains confident that it will end by obtaining the approval of an olive, but with a different route.
This is followed by the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential Indians to avoid areas of the Danube of Nebraska and Ogalala, from large underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review conducted by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision by 2013, after the elections next year, although officials do not have the policy involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as being the decision of the Department of State and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 oil-related jobs.
However, the Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan are under the pressure of a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogalala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study in the Department of State has found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry has stated that the Inspector General of the Department has ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continued for allegedly caused by a young child to smell fear
A New York family says that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva launched in a deconstruction of violence in their Manhattan apartment hall, terrorized their little daughter at the point where she was terrified.
The release of the song "Lady Marmalade" inspired the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so far as it had "the personality changes, sleep problems" and "the increased fear of strangers", said her family during the Supreme Court trial in Manhattan.
It was November 10th of the last year when scene technician Kevin Monk, his wife teacher of the children's garden, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to begin their family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to find the car, Roseanna Monk went down into their apartment hall from Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and had put her daughter for a while.
"Someone came after me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She told me about your aggressiveness: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I don't care."
She became pregnant and began to use jurones - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to suck me out of the bottle's water.
She said that at this point Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the child's mother said.
LaBelle was angry at the mother - who had always held Geneva in her arms - and had to be held by her environment that had trained her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl would cry so hard that she went to smoke, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unexplained damages, but the family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family intends to make a donation from all money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially to a teacher of mothers with a child of 18 months."
Climate aberration has weakened the economy
During Mario López Valdez’s first year of management, unemployment and informatics in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, a self-called change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate warning of the beginning of the year, there is no increase, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators for economic development.
The lower temperatures of February, in addition to the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the state's economy for growth, resulted in a general economic activity contract by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mainly justified by the history of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the Health Care Report by the Mexican Rural Development Council, there have been damages of 582 million hectares, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, main left cultures have been legumes, maize and small fish.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a constant rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three trimesters of the year was accelerated, as from January to March 55 000,053 signallings, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter, the rate of 5.28 per cent, and from July to September, the rate of unemployment continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 million boomers, compared to the first half of 18 million 969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS University of Economic and Social Sciences, the unemployment rate can be explained indirectly by public policy actions.
"What we observe is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because it is not easy for people who earn money illegally to work to win, invest and use it in something," he said.
Emigration held
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work abroad has been limited to the United States, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they have already faced many difficulties in finding work, they stay here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment grow," he said.
No serious
The analysis of the labour market in the signalled labour is worsening by taking into account the high level of serious shortage that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state does not work as a worker at any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and lack of serious concern, another reason for disparity for the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages of the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Ministry of Labour and Social Perspective.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, by September, 5 thousand 352 weights, much lower than the national average, which was 7 thousand 375 weights.
IED Contract
In addition to the decline in economic activity and unemployment, the strongest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years has been recorded in 2011, according to the State Economy Secretariat of January to June IED has reached $630 million 697, which represents a reduction of 87.74 per cent compared to $5 million 143 000 312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pounds per year, primarily recorded by third-party companies.
Let this happen
Given the economic contract scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3 billion weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of revitalizing the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion weights, and until November there was no benefit from revenue in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patrol sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of capacity to manage the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, stated that there was no harmonisation of the will of the various sectors, including the Government of the State, in 2011.
"The economic performance of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we must align the efforts of all and, above all, the good course that has already been modernized by this new Government team, hoping that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic player
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice creams of the beginning of the year held the state economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice, one of the main effects of which has been a slow economy which is not fast enough to generate economic dynamics that enables us to have an acceptable and fluid level in processes, products and services and therefore, by the end of the year, we are much closer to the expectations we have," he said.
Can not open message
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, stated that it is intended to channel the State into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the state's vocation and economic governance, as it is important to detach the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he says.
Many to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel Government efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
It reported that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is much more to be done," he said.
Perjured for 8 kilograms of marijuana
A person living in Novoloto was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment and 100 days' imprisonment for eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Park of the Republic reported that the small offender was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crimes, in his marijuana possession version for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican Army during a surveillance operation in the Cipriano Valdez street, before number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker traveled in a pick-up truck, white-coloured, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's luggage and a small bag on the copilot's seat where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the District Judge Second, and the defendant is still in the Centre for the Exercise of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
These to the contributions to the work
Social works that are included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are not likely to be completed where to record serious delays from lack of economic resources, reported Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Municipal Social Development Director stated that even though construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the Government of the State has not met its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million weights, of which the State is to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing, even though since July they have had to give us a part," he said, "and we, to avoid delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover 7 million which the government had not provided at that time.
"We have already had this in the previous six-year period because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explained.
Despite a commitment by State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that he had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villalarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages would be reached as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us anything."
The valid Court "the analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) has initiated constitutional disputes that the Senate and the House of Deputies have made against the presidential order which goes forward from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes necessary for invalidity have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his terms of reference when he issued the decree detailing the actions to follow up the transition to digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been challenged to prevent the qualified majority from reaching eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree to continue to be in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, given that radio and television regulations are a legal assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofet), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law-reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional contradictions to challenge the order and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all its actions for the digital transition.
The Plenary Meeting of Ministers also decided to address the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, so that the Federal Executive could not structure the measures for public administration to prepare them through general standards.
"I do not consider it any more than it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as telecommunications is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for constitutional command of the State.
Replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years and this is translated into better operation of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
To update the change, he supported it, would update the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest which does not only have a technical dimension, "for this also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, " require the operation of any established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, including a group of attributes that the Constitution grants to the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, had acquired in a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, since it ensured in the administrative sphere respect for the laws issued by the Legislative, to ensure it.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vote vote" account in Michocán
According to the data provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second places of the governor ' s election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the total votes of 879 to 6 thousand 74.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michocán, where according to data from the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second places of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 votes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michocán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards in federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that this electoral process can enter into force and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel has omitted its publication within the time limits laid down by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and qualified as "unofficial and illegal" the vote of the State mandater for constitutional reforms, since he did not have the right to "canonise or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Landeral stated that, through the approval of the relevant guidelines by the IEM General Council, it would be possible to carry out the partial and total voting statements by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages may be: the results of the verbatim proceedings do not match; there is no verbatim trial and there is no error or obvious alterations of the verbatim proceedings.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the proposed candidate obtained from the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who submitted the second of the candidates notified.
The total account of the survey may also be carried out if at the end of the joint report the difference between the proposed candidate and the second place is equal or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the petition expressed by the representative of the political party whose candidate is the second party, where the electoral packages are excluded from the partial report.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PRP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of 923 votes in total.
Its latest will
His ashes will be placed in Zapalinamé's camp, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday to night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requisition.
According to his family, the last will of the Colonel was that his ashes should be returned to Zapalinamé's camp.
After receiving the damages on the part of the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, the nearest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
Halfway through the lieutenant-colonial's hundreds arrived at the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends returned.
At 17:30 p.m., he was awarded tribute to the Institute of Technology of Saltillo organized by his former colleagues of technological Baccalaurate and the American football team, which was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the Baccalaurate.
"He would like to go back to Saltillo and his centurions would be buried in Zapalinamé's camp, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the Colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she thought that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a caring brother and he cared very much for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he had even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahasgunu to Saltillo."
The young man remembers even the fact that when he was 7 years old, he traveled to Zapopán for his parents' graduation, so he knew his uncle was killed by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
Last Played
He was honored to see Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in honor of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting collapsed, along with the Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The rest of the Bacio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo (incinerated) arrived at 18:05 hours to be delivered by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the team plan, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by fire cuts in various parts of the body and with the cut of grace, in a abandoned property of the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 km road from Cadereyta in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who had gone through this area observed that in the property, whose closure had beige colour and coffee the portal was wide open.
With regard to the interior, at approximately three metres, they located the bodies of three persons, which was why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One individual wore a yellow T-shirt with bent jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with glasses.
At a distance there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue-colored jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to the data received in situ, the three persons had been murdered elsewhere, as no injuries were found in situ.
In the closing of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime to each other, apart from some dance orifices in it and in the portal.
11 captures in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadreyta, who were considered to have been involved with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhumation.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony and managed to save one who had been deprived of his liberty.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they said they were part of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00 p.m., the military staff conducted a monitoring course in Rancho Viejo, Cadreyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the soldiers found a long weapon, a cargo and 18 cartons.
Later and after those statements, on 13 November at 14:00, one of its complications was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumation in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The first Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
The first Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has destroyed all the Eurozone.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed of most of its technocrates, even though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he was going to present to the President the outcome of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well-tracked", add it.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has caused the costs of its debt at levels that cannot be supported.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong asylum package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti, the instability of the markets in place of the performance of the Italian BTP obligations to more than 7 per cent over 10 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcagaglia, head of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to experience this emergency.
Monti's success opportunities were greatly encouraged by the support of the PDL party Silvio Berlusconi, where the crisis forced the past Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good outcome," said the press, Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have been opposed to the Government of the technological majority that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be popular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and patronage groups and youth organizations and women.
He'll finish his tour of tomorrow night's meetings.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt are now at critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the elections planned for 2013, in spite of generalised predictions of the fact that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insisted on the fact that he should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual amphibians and discrepancies between the parties are complicated by the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is higher than the Spanish.
Ten of the 22 footballers named Spain participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 calls attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 calls by the two countries for today's friend at 15:05 p.m. at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of the FIFA's monthly classifications, account for a wide range of Class A inter-selective games, the Tricolore only has Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and powerful British First League clubs maintain an intense activity every year in national league campaigns and cuts and disputes in European Cups such as the League Championships.
To that end, experience with Furia Española must be added during the complex elimination of the European Cup and the World Football.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to an area such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be lower in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guard Íker Casallas, who, as the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) also recorded the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casallas will play against the Tricolore today and will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, who flew from Barcelona to 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke front centre Raúl González with 102.
The century's prize is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Ineista, with 62; Csc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the coastal side, and close to Michael Umana are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Brian Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
The historical butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mice, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records it most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Amen of Pearl Jam said the group was ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that this will also be a real dream for them.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament made sure, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American ale of its two-day workout tour and on Sunday 20 will be the only step in Central America.
This day will be held at the National Stadium from 19:30 p.m. on the side of the Los Angeles The X and the national Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, including full transcription in La Nación on the Internet.
For its cost-effective adaptations, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been huge.
I went to Costa Rica only once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us feel like carrying our music down there.
I ask you, since there is a sort of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity in the days before.
What is your message for your most zealous adapters?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we were disappointed that it had to take so long to this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've been offering in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows in São Paulo and we hope it has formed us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make surf and jungle; for both things Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its vagabonds to make the surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the cows are incredible down there.
My friends were always going to make surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, alongside Mexico, are great places to make surf; that is what we have learned from people who love surf.
When you saw the tournament, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What does that have to do with you?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each love different songs, so it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not played for so long, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons we love these songs and that we may have forgotten them.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes even more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you did?
Yes, absolutely.
Firstly, I believe that none of us had imagined we were going to form a large group of rock, and the fact that we've done it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and worship music.
We are able to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things could not go better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grain?
This has always been an honor for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups go out at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tournament, so we were able to be still friends with them all and it's an honor to be part of this Seatle sound that emerged.
It's also very strange that a group like yours keeps together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameraron) joined us 13 years ago, and that's just a lot more time than many groups usually spend.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical bullevards that give each one the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and this could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you were able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We'll make sure that we don't spend too much time around because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what it has brought, without worrying about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't published a disc before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There have been many frustrations about the fact that she has endured so little and the most important is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he was laughing, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a wonderful human being, and he missed us.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and that's why you chose to open it?
Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and it has been the group we most loved, so we are excited to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very interesting.
Why are you always changing Yello Ledbutter's words?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
It's him who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are its influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grain relevant despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the Greek word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think that this is great because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are doing the best music now than ever.
At first, his music had a more darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It is interesting, because I believe there are songs in the new album that seem smaller, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which are very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I wept when I heard them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you're older and there's a trauma in your life and you're losing a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs are undoubtedly for me.
I also think we can be happy as well as even as we can be made of dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has presented in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various infections, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguyunga, his personal doctor, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss in its lower members.
Aguyuga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the release of the punishment for humanitarian reasons, he undoubtedly said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times by language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe gastritis, pancreas, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and blood circulation problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons because of an army anonymization squadron that had operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official court, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico this afternoon to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long-standing agenda of meetings with political, commercial and community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda published by the Uruguayan President.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara City will be "close for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French mandater Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradises at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the international community from the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that has caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been the president of the G20, a group of emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January of this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to establish tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "gri list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
From 2004 onwards, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu bomber passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought invasively, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from poor Bowser's flu, but he never did it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of youngster in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the world's stores, has been designed since the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using Lunets.
"Mario is the person who has to say how to work without Monday stereoscopy," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and smooth part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" in order to attract the less skilled users.
Once overmounted, the most experts can make a "second round" at game levels, which this time is more difficult.
In addition, users can actually choose between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not to mention optical illusions".
This three-dimensional super Mario intrusion also assumes the return of personnel to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games, he turns his eyes on the suitors of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu bomber must walk through platforms that are meant to free Princess Peach.
Although I am a player, I find news in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "joyful".
Colom gave his fall to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy of 70 million US dollars.
The process thus ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was subject to the independence of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had conducted all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extracted for serious murder and injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extracted for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive course after he has dismissed all the judicial and constitutional courts to judge the former term of office for 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be removed after having settled its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely responsible for the disbursement of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs called and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently available by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance in a famous act in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are not trained, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andrew concentrated a large number of responsible entities and institutions that have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The variety of political representation, in full electoral season, has shown the unitary nature of work done by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generality), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and former mayor of the mayor and current councillor of Eco-Socialist Richard Goma.
The former Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large room of Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that it is now too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is nothing new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Invasive property by vectors for micro-fests, evacuated
The invasives were suitable for 11 of the 13 buildings in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left their property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the collapse of Rue Balmes' 51 residents was over.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the property they were taking illegally and where they organized micro-fests that would expect neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door valve was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were common - carried the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving wastes of any kind, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which would last for up to two days and wait for the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that 80 per cent of her business has fallen since the building's occupation.
The discotheque owner mentioned that the owners of the discotheque made him deloyable, because they sold the wines to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the shelter had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while the noise was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the residents of the busy house and especially the participants at the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the area's irritated neighbors.
The discotheque officer explained that the villages were so large that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and that it took nine months for the man to "forgive him" to rent it.
The City Guardia (municipal police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP municipal group of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the property to end with the problems of common and civil life which it has contributed to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one stage of the building, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be imputable against anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday too, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's number 35 after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four persons had access to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of summoning beyond the polymique on the honours
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
Toward the middle of the 1980s, in full support of the Barcelona Metropolitical Corporation (CMB), this administration printed Collserola promotion posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that is not on the south axis, either up (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is in favour of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park sinon Yellowstone, with candles in the role of our Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called for a mega competition composed of 16 competitions for all access ports in Colserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to thinking about the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former elite caste speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And that's just one of the rare opinions that three Barcelona architects, university professors, have come up with.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Rollan, after addressing the literary front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green houses, was not brought to an end.
"It must come from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," he gave the verdict the architect for which the title "Collserola ports" means a "Lexican bridge": it should not be considered "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Module, such as Rollan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, defines the proposal as "intellectual challenges" with "some dangers".
"The uncertainty of public space projection" after the experience in the 1980s and in the forum "song song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means setting the next step already," that is, its excess.
"It is necessary to consider new urban, planning instruments, because current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can cause catastrophic authenticities."
Taking further into account the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the El Valles de Colserola region's "can be heard as a park, Barcelona's one, no".
Modul recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers his company to intervene in this project "from the first time".
In addition, he believes that the approach of the mountain to the city is the safe way for architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that it has to be created: "We, architects, should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this part is complex, because the competition bases lack a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions - he says - in the sense of the sea, but there is no lengthal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole."
At least in this case, he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one of the ports to shock the program and definition with the architect of the nearby port.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the immediate band above that of Ronda de Dalt should, throughout its extension, provide for an area of equipment that carries out a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino apologizes to Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released free
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial against him for alleged chants
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red gives him an apology before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial against the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attention of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas claimed to require him to pay for an economic quota so that Monterey's mayor allows the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public announcement, the Park opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor PANIST, and on 2 September he was arrested and detained for 30 days.
Four hours later, he was transferred to the 1st Detention Centre, located in the Old quarter of the State's capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was sentenced to a second detention order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had relieved the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal centre, supposedly for singing with one and a half million of his weights to the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the process in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the deposit of 1.5 million weights of the representative of the game house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented before Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Ministry officer assigned to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been associated with the game house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
In accordance with document 197/2011, the legal apology is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no further claim for the proceedings against him will be made; no damages will be claimed and no punishment will be imposed.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the game house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome communicates details of the plane accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others have lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives, indicating that the helicopter was directly shocked at the soil in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the landing of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had several contact with the soil, the poles have been contacted with the trees at 25 metres where the unit has lost the fossilation."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
Furthermore, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one study it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a seven to 30 degree slope.
For the moment, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take several months, it may even last a year.
On his tour, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Aid Services, ensured that the impact of the moment, the helicopter of the Presidential State was operating quickly and it happened on a rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operation crossing at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
_Visual volume:
According to Aeronautics, the flight has been carried out according to the rules of the flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in ICM referred to appropriate conditions for decoupling, and in the past and measured that the aircraft was moving towards the DF border zone and the State of Mexico there were low-frequency layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to the nebulosity conditions, the crew has sought a lower altitude area and more visibility to the river Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording of the aircraft on the co-incident radar, probably before the impact, were no loss of control or alteration of the flight router.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has been placed on a right and lateral tractor.
The model for dispersion of the remaining aircraft allows us to assume that the helicopter has hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No fire or explosion traces have been detected:
In the left place there is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 000 200 feet above the average level of the sea, and the ground had a pen that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have landed along his route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopters may have multiple effects on the soil.
After a minute of research in a wider area than the affected area, there were no dispersal parts of the aircraft, which suggests the assumption that the impact was made under structural integrity conditions.
MSS protocol announcement to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IGN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to detect obesity in the case of children and young people, called the "Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents" protocol, which will allow for signs associated with obesity.
In a communication, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemie of the Hospital of the Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by experts and students from the third cycle of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPP).
In the investigation, it is invited to take part in or not in the community, to be presented to IMSS participating sports units in Valle de Mexico, where evidence is available to minors from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun in the Cuahutemoc Sports Unit (Estado de Mexico Ponieente) and that since 8 October the activity was carried out in the Sport Unit of Nezahualkóyolt (Estado de Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing 500 or 600 minors together, the study will continue in the Unit Sportive Independent (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Unit Sportive Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research and that it was to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with their parents' consent and under their supervision, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family heritage predecessors of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that result from diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that the samedis will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size, circumference of size), arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to identify the people associated with child obesity).
Cruz López reported that this research is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight in the case of minors.
" The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there has been an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent in girls; a dramatic increase in overweight has also been observed," notes the IMSS Specialist.
He stated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of indo-American heritage, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of Africans, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general the genetics of obesity are inexhaustible to burn the excess energy used (calories), which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect if they have a degree of obesity or obesity.
She even said that the presence of higher sombre color (acantosis) on the neck and front arm indicates the probability of suffering from metabolic disorders and even diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, which doctors transmit in writing to parents, explaining each of the measures and changes in the life-style that they must make to prevent the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic effects: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remains most of the day sitting in front of the television and uses means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugard beverages, carbon hydrates (tamales - meat pasta of maize covered in maize leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the University of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Gulf of Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who has ensured that if the build and maintenance process of the bitumenical floor is adequate, the cases could be completely reduced or even eliminated.
At its conference A technological opinion on cassies, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cassises.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the powder its viscosity behavior.
The viscosity of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures at about 180 degrees it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes falling, adding it to it.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible deck, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three involving the asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones covered with asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, signaling it, is washed asphalt.
When vehicles are driven by efforts, it allows forces to thrive very well in the yard.
If we had the modified asphalt, they would have spread better, thinking the chemical engineer.
On the layer of asphalt, he said, it was put on a last layer called a rolling layer, made in final stone, that is, the sand that is also wrapped in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the layer of asphalt and provide the adhesion in the road.
As part of the pave that receives and distributes the effort, the wheeling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be cared for.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as it says, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil melts, the water expands inside the layer is difficult for that to happen, which depletes all layers of the floor and thus causes chaos.
In the formation process of a case, he says, the first one who gets into trouble is the rolling film and only later is affected by the asphalt layer, but the damage has not taken place immediately, but it is a process that must be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of helmets and therefore the thickness of each deck must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of helmets.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to invest and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsion, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy repair of cases and without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her princess's title number 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca remains eager to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be happy to be on the winner's podium, to bring the crown of money and the band that credit it as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department already has 14 titles from Princes and Melina belonging to a legend of women from Valle del Cauca who have been found near the crown but have been declared princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Mary Alvarez (1981), Rose Maria Alzate (1983), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007) and Alphanie Garcées (Garès) (2007).
Today the big question that many people in the world ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result is the lack of a great favour that in each presentation he showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected Queen of the Police and Best Visit Jolie de Vogue, titles received by the Queens of Italiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who had borne the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered in the decision taken by the jury of the First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? was put by Martin Murillo Gómez, from the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment", a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Niemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The End of Blood".
This answer did not apply at all first because of the term "culturalise" and secondly because it did not explain exactly how each book mentioned it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, what must happen.
And for the whole world, please read, "The Little Prince" is a big book.
Among the assumptions launched there is that according to which Valle was destroyed by favourism.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that being the preferred, ovated and candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artistic custom, and Queen Mother), "it revealed the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that it did not shine on the scene".
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom e-mail to Hilton beach and his two-defianced crown guard.
Although it appeared to the two dissidents to be certain of her own, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en house" (As at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was appointed prince "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prices during the competition does not receive the queen crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Dughty said they were looking for an engaged woman with regard to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, it needs to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, before the competition is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also stated that Valle has sinned by her faults of her back and the fibrosis which was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because the jury has chosen her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the most healthy body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen's cook Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had no better body than he had, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which, in fact, had not been too well known for me, left her the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Chromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical intervention she had taken.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle can't do them.
His body has never been his entire body and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, which the National Beauty Competition awarded for the first time, after the fall in the bath past came up a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymondo was doing in Melina so as not to give him the taste of the crown.
In reality or not, the truth is that Melina is starting today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her wandering through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So it was the work of the Cali person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A dactyloscopist from Cali has gone through history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, a Dactyloscopist of the CTI of Cali passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", in comparison with his digital printers.
Seven dactyloscopists working in the local CTI offices this week were the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after attending appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of hair frying, i.e. trees and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alphonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take at least three days' habit with him.
Something really big was waiting for her.
On Friday night he's part of Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that he was suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten digital printers of Guillermo León Sáenz (the real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because he was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no barbes, he was dressed like a landscaper in the area, without sunsets and much bigger.
But the press don't lie.
accompanied by a Galtonian hole, of the inside, a carrier and a Lantern, Eliasazar compared the digital impressions of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, Puerto Tejada's original man was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the Supreme Chief of Farcs.
In Search of the Print
For a dactyloscopist in Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at a press conference against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without a margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
When captured, many criminals present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their digital impressions and searches into the database.
The researcher said that in a case of a flight he had to remove a part of a wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand in making out a bag full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a digital impression, but in this case we were able to get the impression from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Entrepreneurs may also remove or confirm suspicions in cases of murder.
Recently we found a dead man with drinking bottles around him.
During the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of crime and, in effect, an impression on the bottle was coincidental.
Even if this doesn't guarantee it's the killer, it's the place on the crime scene.
A CTI datatyloscopist explained that it is extracted "the digital pressure of objects with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, it is used as a pre-filled pen or tape to pick them up.
Subsequently, the printers are sent to Asif, the data base of the offenders, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is there's still a lot of paperless Colombians," says the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines isn't gold, everything we touch doesn't become an impression.
However, it can be used if the necessary comparison is made.
The "indigenous" defends the authorities in New York.
Hundreds of protesters were staring at Zuccotti's place to camp there.
A large part of the people had access to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Employment Wall Street movement challenged New York's authorities this morning by trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, in Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the trees and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of protesters were busted in front of Zuccotti, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allowed 'indigenous' people to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will install ourselves elsewhere and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sites and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the portals of the movement "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the 'indigenous' response to the evacuation of their camp personally ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigens' occupied a new park located at the collapse of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is the new New York and New Jersey, owned by the Paris Trinity Church.
At least one hour they succeeded in taking the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some protesters, even though Brey could not confirm the actual number, ensuring that he saw some journalists who had also been interviewed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have been installed in this area where a delegation of religious leaders has moved to support the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property shelter - remains closed waiting for a judicial hearing to be held on this Tuesday, during which we must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Several protesters moved up there and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time, and they even delivered it to the local surveillance officers, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who declared that some officials had attacked the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evaluating members of the occupation Wall Street or applying laws published after the start of the occupation or prohibits protesters from re-entering the park with the temptations or other properties they used before".
The Mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the opening of space to the public and the protesters, to whom it had warned that local laws did not allow them to install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation of the abe at Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and which was decided on account of the 'violation of the law' of the protesters.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it had to be "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning at the apple tree has been rescinded and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than it is," adds the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The "Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not intend to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a lapin in "Playboy", a husband of rock music Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Marie in a special program by Noel on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, with a very special version of Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary, supporting a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently introduced a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared like Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV is also presented by the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'putte' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the drop-down spiral in early March.
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have estimated the material losses of $300,000 million, a time when, despite the difficult global context, it seems to have fallen.
After three consecutive three trimesters of fall, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent at an annual rate.
He recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - he also assumes the largest rise rate since the January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by earthquake and tsunami.
In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first recovery after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Kenyan momentum that invites the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructures, use zero growth gaps.
Japan was particularly emerging through domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The y position of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Nippon currency - became one of the 'refugee values' chosen by investors who were the eurozone debt crisis and the predicted problems of the United States, a privilege that is passed as a debt in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious backdrop for a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their weak results between July and September.
While markets continue to sit in the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda ' s Government does not fall under guard.
"It is necessary to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that most Member States had presented more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator predicting global economic integration points has highlighted that the main powers are frozen.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, down from eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athenians feed again the suspects
Papadimos said the adjustments would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written commitment
With reduced peripheral risk premiums and re-installed uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to compete in the labyrinth which leads to the outbreak of the major European debt crisis.
The sense that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, had announced yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set out in his appointment could be short to apply, the Conservative Party's leader, New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he did not have to support the new asylum measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the Staff Discipline Code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not raise doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are no longer committed to anything."
The conservative leader went further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and clearly stated that he will not approve any letters of commitment to the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still upset by the impact caused by the whole of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambition as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "presiding" position with regard to this type of funding
Spain "has reached a position premeditating at the global level in the role of the Microfinances".
Queen Sofia has recalled that the country has become the second provider of planetary cooperation in the last two decades with regard to this instrument of "the essence" which lies in the fact that it is "a tool for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the V-e World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "very specially, in those who have the goal of reducing half the volume of people living with income under one dollar a day, the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continued to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and undertakes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which would extend until today, "ensure the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which "two basic objectives" must be driven.
His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of these families were from the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the initial sense of pioneering a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "cause of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as "a wonderful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "At each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave him the "family head" qualification at Valladolid, part of the "poor bank".
Finally, Queen Sofia has completed its intervention by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, she pointed out that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Yemen considered that microcredit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of pressures.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, called on "the success" to give "of confidence" to people "excluding those who are close to the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, wished to welcome the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President to the universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU), held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, was without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally intended for the programme but was imposed on the autonomous people, especially to satisfy the military forces who judge the government's policies too much to see the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, has been adopted in almost unanimity.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes at which they were entitled, following their interventions, by Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea of the chancellor - and the motion - holds a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "Time has come from a Persian in Europe".
This could be translated into amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the euro area's budgetary policies, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffering "in order to give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the motion proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly inspires Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Septs will soon agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also there.
But the iron is put on.
In the same way, delegates rejected the growing majority of the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the director of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which was obviously a means of strengthening Germany's weight.
In order to show the climate within its part, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has no longer sought to win its conference on the two "small" European countries or countries in immediate difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except for cremation.
Remembering that there were two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a battleship.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliating failures of the Napoleonian army.
What's wrong with the arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box of family rentals, and to give a speech on the subject - which has been the subject since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a desire to make economies in a harsh context, but is no longer an adverting of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on disease arrests.
First of all in a budgetary economy: the government intends to impose a fourth day of unemployment before a job stop is taken.
Of course, without the agreement of a specific company, a payer who falls sick would lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to trigger anger, but which would enable it to report EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, with more symbolic weight: to impose an unpaid day of absence on employees in the event of termination of work (they have not so far had time of absence, against three days in the privacy).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also address the subject of fraud, aiming at this time abuses related to labour arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be repaid," warned Xavier Bertrand to the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work arrests.
This has been the subject of constant and violent political follow-up since 2002 which has most often borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick in Europe.
Let's start by drawing on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, daily wages represented 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
On this basis, 46 per cent were affected by maternity leave and work accidents, and 54 per cent by disease arrests, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were on average 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
One medium that hides some discrepancies: another survey published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken a day to stop the disease.
Another study, this time of the Disease Insurance , indicated that 37% of the disease arrests in 2010 were from less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% from beyond.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer more focused on job arrests.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud of the disease arrests is very small in the face of work in the black.
As far as fraud is concerned, it only achieves a weaker dimension.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million controls, NCAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjusted or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of more than 45-day arrests, which were systematically controlled, there were 11 per cent of "inadjusted or unjustifiable" cases of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjusted" cases, on several million employees with a disease arrest.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, that of work in the black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, author of a June report, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, more than the total cost of daily wages, and therefore more than the fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece should apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundreds of days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"To continue economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the Wednesday Parliament's confidence vote.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is in play", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos provided that the country's public deficit would be reduced by around 9 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Law refuses new austerity measures
Mr. Antonis Samaras, the head of the law file, gave his support on Monday for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but prevented his party from committing itself to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the Members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and of fighting but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who prevented the IMF and the EU from unlocking the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantees from all parties to support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
I need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee.
Canadians live in the death penalty, according to the Canadian Royal Society report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the depths of death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take measures to do so.
It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when such a choice is made, with a judge competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the game, experts refer to a recent study by the U.S. Economist Intelligence, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada is classified as 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports to us by the experts authorized by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians wanted to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them ended up dying at the hospital.
In general, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths from hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report come up with conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that there is nothing to change to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legislated or discriminated against, there is no evidence that this discrimination leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide involving persons who are not competent or not consented.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-rapporteur of the report, stated yesterday at teleconference, would find more cases of these debriefings precisely in countries where euthanasia and suicide are not legalized.
"Euthansia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explained Jocelyn Downnie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their life to ease their suffering, according to Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legislating euthanasia will not have a effect on sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
With regard to persons who have committed suicide, it is estimated that 41 per cent should not be continued.
With regard to maintenance or discontinuation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it should be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which a legally valid refusal was not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a refusal of life-long care without fear of criminal prosecutions.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal seduction, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
But Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of signatory experts in the report, among other things, as it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ills.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would have been over 18 years of age could ask for help to commit suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to put the person's autonomy above all other values that are involved in the social fabric of society.
But, "In society, he says, there are balls and pressures."
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is in particular responding to the data of the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw his power
Ladies declare a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The participants from Bachar al-Assad presented yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures have intensified yesterday on Syria by Bachar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists and denounces a "computer" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, close to Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Yesterday, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "cut power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country near Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed the disappointment that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime have been fought by a mistake.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey adopts a more durable line.
The United States is happy to "increase the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are adopting a more difficult tone of pressure in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, at least 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces disappeared in the region of Dera, south of Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians lost "the exchange of shots and pillage to the heavy metallic loads in Jobar" in the city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Moualem, however, felt that the country "would be heading towards the end of the crisis".
He also has a strong response to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damas from his work, which he considers to be "a dangerous step".
Syria "does not fly," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "Civil Protection Mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he claims to be in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is planned at Rabat tomorrow to mark the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November and to include the withdrawal of the armed forces of the towns in order to challenge and release arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday 'inaccurate' the Arab League decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Mounting demand for time to markets and sacrifices in Italy
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time on markets to train his team and implement a program that would contain "sacrifices" to recover the credibility lost in the last few months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner was discussing with political parties yesterday before today's union and patronage.
It should set up a relatively limited office composed of external technologies in Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the meetings, after meeting with the designated President of the Council.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, expressed his hope that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of ministers, no doubt twelve of them, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of business and mandatory markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are certain times" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying "certainly the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was raised, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should be a team that includes, in particular, technocrates, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government has to wait until 2013, the date of the next legislative year, has been estimated.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament this Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, has undertaken to work in an emergency and with the aim of Italy 'become a protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian "pattern of Parents" Emma Marcagagglia, who will see it tomorrow, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" representing "the challenge of the serial" and a "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the length of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid pre-elections, as Italy is expected to be in April 2012 for EUR 200 billion of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA has taken part in the last week of its "serious concerns" about a "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural), and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It would then cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during its career on this technology during the military programme of its country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased from almost 50% in 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence has decreased slightly or slightly, according to the FBI statistics performed on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent of the increase, 13 per cent of the violence against Catholics, 4 per cent of the crimes against Jews, and 14 per cent of the total increase in crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," stressed Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the heads of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US Government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he added, thinking that this could happen through an improvement in police reports on hate crimes.
"Crime of hate" in U.S. federal law is an inheritance of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish racial violence, the color of skin, religion, origin and sexuality.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow it, which makes its service somewhat more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" will allow you to follow more easily, directly, the activities of other "Twittos", the Internet that follows the messages ("tweets") and those that follow you.
This allows them to follow messages, subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorable messages, etc.
This new Twitter form was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it was broadcast throughout the Monday network, indicated to the AFP Twitter portal, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctal operation, with some eccentric terms (RT to re-commission a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) thus opening up to a wider audience with a more similar approach to large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users discussed "tweets" broken down on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much on Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity functionality will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Registration of a "budget gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic Coalition of Power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "budget rule" to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign note (Triple A).
It is the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision to him after a ministerial council, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6 per cent, largely above the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only by one cran from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest per year," argued Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore submits a request for a summit in Brussels of the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the inclusion by end 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", Germany has been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
As of 2017, the structural public deficit will be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) each year and, by 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, while the regional and common states will have to submit budgets to the balance.
The objective is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.

Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the change market if Yen had to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we find an excessive volatility" at the change rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the island was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
Today, Tokyo has sold heavily against dollars in order to lower the value of the Nippon loan that had been setting up a new force record since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly recovered since, accompanied by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refugee value" in these times of uncertainty about global economic slowdowns and a crisis of income in Europe.
The dollar was reimbursed on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro was down under the 105 yen's symbolic bar, near the levels that have led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This fine of the Japanese dividend night to the exports of the archipelago because it earned the cost of Made products in Japan and reduced the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they converted them into national currency.
" Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which destroyed the Tohoku region (north-east), highlighted Mr. Noda who was afraid that this reconnaissance of the yen would not kill the fragile remains.
The third world economic power has increased with growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rescheduling of exports and consumption of households that had been hit by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister ruled that the yen's ring did not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to improve the yen.
However, the Deputy Government of the Institute, Hirohide Yamaguchi, suggested that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting it be clear that no additional monetary supplement was waiting for Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Emission Institute increased its acquisitions of assets of the Treasury to 55,000 billion yens (519 billion euros) to the ceiling of the amounts it devoted to the purchases of different financial securities in order to launch the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
the rates are decreasing, the Bours are falling
The risk of infection of the debt crisis is still the European index.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the levels of the countries of the FRA continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Borders are a little more in negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt dropped by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
" With new tensions on the performance of the euro area State loans in difficulty, the world-wide action markets continue to be part of their recent gains " .
"Energy investors are just too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional court member at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Bourgeois had a 0.7 per cent decline in its round of renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trades will continue in a corridor of variations as long as investors will not have any evidence that the situation is stable," says Mitsushige Akino, managing funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This recovery of concerns about the future of the euro area criminalises the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European loan is worth $1.3570, worth 0.4%.
According to the courts, after meeting with the CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, had adopted a motion which included the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union so much.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy's and Spain's loan rates remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85 per cent, of Spanish titles of the same maturity of 6.2 per cent.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed fear of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti claimed time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is in the market view line, while there are Sundays of legislative elections in the country.
The gap between obligations for 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
In the interest of euro area growth figures
With statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent to the third quarter, or slightly higher than 0.3 per cent expected by households consumption.
However, the Insee has revised the second quarter's figure, with a return of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one who's worried most about economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just taken stock of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be imported on the documents
If it is a matter which cannot be dealt with from short-term or short-term considerations, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to think about such issues and where the nuclear power plant is located.
The debate will be fruitful only if it examines all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will result in a double demand for electricity by 2050, at least privatizing an enormous part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to refurbish fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate depletion, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits the sign to the need to find a substitute source of replacement, nor with Switzerland, who just understands to build up the centres of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima, to add a unit to their park by taking over the construction of a interrupted centre after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
Berlin's choice will be translated by investing in electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and carbon centres.
In a few months, all of these side effects have already been felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
Europe's oil champion, which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest coal and gas users in terms of wind intermittentity; hence, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbours achieve a higher electricity factor than 40% of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and of the maintenance of industrial tools on the national territory, French companies benefit from electricity the least expensive of Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction in the nuclear part would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, as long as they do not manifest a violation of the principle of this energy, the surveys show it.
We recall that our country's energy policy has allowed us to build an industrial line of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indigenous jobs.
It is a strong exporter, it brings about a range of specialised SMEs on international markets and makes them very job-makers non-delocateable.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear industry, it would have sacrificed a good number of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricity would an EPR be designed to operate for six hundred years while its manufacturer's deceleration would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miraculous electricity, no more than a devil.
The development by Areva of low emission CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewables, testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear industry, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts intransparent control and transparent control over existing centres such as the Flamanville Canter.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are accustomed to the same security obsession.
In one half century, the nuclear industry had three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, has been involved in normal operating conditions; it remains without human or environmental consequences.
At Tchernobyl, the design of the reactor and the unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take away the teachings of this accident, as it did for the two previous generations.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that enables it to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who want to build a centre, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them free way to compare their leadership to the inconsistencies in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy supply for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and works of the party dominate a debate also crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various English-ingreement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" in France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have done so, the Minister of the Interior (read Freedom of 23 May), announcing the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masonry and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this matter between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with about 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the poverty of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by the order of Polish bombers was shared on the left as well as on the right.
On both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is to the degree of generosity that it is difficult to give sight to immigrants.
In its programme François Hollande sings about vandalities, indicating that co-development will help solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electronically paying; but it is very cost-effective.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent work that synthesiss the most recent knowledge on immigration (Excellent People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict anonymous immigration to growth and night work.
The fear of the impact of migrants is based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, especially the underqualified workers, with pressure to lower their salaries.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than substitutes for national wages, which are used for the significant use of metrics in employment-related sectors.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national wages, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is not the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have a bad job in a country that knows a shortage of anesthetists, these supplements between national and migrant immigrants have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase of 0.6% and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution of EUR 150000 (less cost) to public budgets for the rest of its life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to go looking for missing points of growth "with teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to discourage immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for his invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, had known the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Goullag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonials in Greece.
Some believed that it would be enough for democracy to be definitively opposed to its enemies, to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon's "the Little" it was an easy idea.
The universal suffering, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough and can even be "an instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we live in is an economic crisis, but it is a political and democratic crisis.
The palinoidity of the real Greek referendum will have been in this respect the value of a double revelation: the need for a strong return from politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its inability, of its indigence.
This ambivalentity must be considered to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle are now being moved, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from requiring a succession of national referendums, organized in response to the needs and in order of dispersion.
A white-sieging in the absolute European monarchy or a foot-and-mouthed sand in the empty nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want co-operations but an exercise, common, full of law, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we could no longer stop counting - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that falls into the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humble on the international scene.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent thing is to give popular sovereignty back to the piloting of the European project.
As a whole, Europeans can reduce their debt, free markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will support decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless we are sure to lead to disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, the European Economic Government is now declared by the whole world.
I'll call you back.
But to think about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens would be a new phenomenon and a new impasse.
We must take a new step towards European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, it had to "make" the Republicans.
The Revolution in the interest could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on the economic level.
This will only be possible by building a more democratic Europe on a political basis, a real European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, we do Europeans.
"No contact" cards are common
The world hall of the fashion card opens on Tuesday in Villapinte, near Paris, in an optimal climate.
The year 2011 should actually end up on an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is technology without contact that allows you to pay the transport in common or fix your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million cards for free of contact should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million one year earlier!
Their share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for the credit card (6,925 million cards).
Long in the training of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe receives land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, starters are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double mouths.
Carrefour thus issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
In order to survive at a higher rate, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to spreading regularly to their customers of bank cards equipped for offline contact," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
Five devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is necessary for transactions.
"They've been paying for the delay."
"But they should finally know a real essence next year."
"Our tables on sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explained Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a December-June test in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a study allowing payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, she also said yesterday, prepared to put on the market a offer that allows her customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is coming
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected of a long date, the links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algeria now "takes certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation of two French raptures in Niger last January would have been carried out by passengers.
Kidnapping in a Niamey restaurant by neighbors of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their rapists during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the dozens of interventions, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone stations belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Action
The analysis of past calls to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interesting to researchers: one man to a Nigerian who lived long in Maiduguri, one of the northern towns of Nigeria, one of Boko Haram's breeze and the other to a man who called himself close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's an advance, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the section has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more active," says a Nigerian researcher named Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months these "backs" have been more evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operational modes, which now involve the use of more complex fireplaces or explosive devices than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, at the beginning of Washington, then pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of less-deserved light.
A Speedy Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist leader Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haousa means " western education is a sin" - the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is political and requires strict respect for the charia while its soldiers commit themselves to the fight against the corrupt central government.
These last ones first refer to the churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, the forces of Boko Haram were particularly active, increasing attacks on the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, with no tunes.
The army invests the city, 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its northern branches.
At Christmas last, she resells an alert that makes 80 deaths in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram takes him to the secure police QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria concerned now all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Cebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé took care of Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The World by Republican candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are vying for simplicity and ignorance.
An American who is weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, will it?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonnourish statements and cutbacks in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's aid, the Slovenians - often not being - fled.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed in the "Grand Old Party" course, threatened to train the Chinese before the WTO and cause them "to manipulate their currency", a theme in an American that was expressed by the migration of all Pans of his industry to Asia.
It's so bad if this should involve the decoupling of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China from Obama and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to stand out in the face of an attitude that "expresses" emotions.
He called for a peaceful but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depth of the surveys, remains unheard of.
To Reagan Image
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran, he'll be fine."
"If Obama is real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance in Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations against this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate for the best position, shows him a disturbing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Pékin " trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has been holding the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks against Iran, says he's ready to commit the American army to Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also preconceived by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents claim that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine on anti-terrorism.
They insist on the lack of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too fast departure of Iraq's "boys" on his tertivations in Libya, thus calling him a weak label.
But the attack isn't so easy.
The population is rather positive about the national security balance of Obama, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has suffered from military intervention that leads to arrest.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, new port of entry of Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream Gasoduc, directly linking Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million beds.
Gazprom, the Russian gas generator, wanted to celebrate the event with ecclest.
More than 500 guests from four Heads of State and Government participated, on the Baltic side Tuesday, between orchestra and final buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, this new Gazoduc, which is located directly below the sea, Russia in Germany.
Figuratively, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the wave of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gozoduc, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubic metres will be reached each year in Western Europe by a 1 224 km first tube bound by St. Petersburg in the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, allowing the total release of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already mentioned the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and in time of this huge song has wind to win.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lose some power: it becomes more difficult for them to burden Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the strongest of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a " new German-Soviet-Soviet pact ", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is whether the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the price of a energy reduction in Europe, as the project has created a barrier between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in five years of imprisonment, had its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, heavily gas consumers, and whose guesses are in decline.
"This Gazoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artrel which binds us organically," François Fillon confirmed by opening up this Gazoduc, showing how large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, who are present in Lubmin at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical operation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel in order to protect it from ships' anchorages.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, 200 m in the middle.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mines dating from World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There has also been a need to multiply measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Towers Eiffel, which does not break up all its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned throughout Sweden, but the project officials rejected it while the Swedish were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently established along their borders.
"In case of accident, we'll stop gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of flight, the gas contained in the gasduct is then flown into the air.
However, this case is unlikely to be judged by the builders who planned to find out a flight every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the Gaza Strip is ensured by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus traveling within the Gaza Strip.
In the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a diameter meter, and is driven by gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at 3 seconds speed, it provides precise information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without having to take up the minimum repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars on the way, and 100 on the way.
Five companies have united their forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the parties.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then sold to this company for 20 renewable years the total gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom pays for total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was ensured at 30% by shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Switzerland, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to go back to their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gozoduc emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandal litoral plant of pines.
Valves, heights of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit door.
Captors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that occurs before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million meters of Russian gas cubes every hour.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to reconstitute the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing into the light of a buggy.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular cover, its elasticity, its leaves of a cut white color, as old as time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time of launching a card of design but distinguished notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the skirmish (tear) mollusc which describes a Vernis cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This kind of carnet was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine gave the day's taste an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of pre-gards artists until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has been responsible for the brand at Modo Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to 12.7 million.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, since the note card is both seised by business as well as by the student and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, is now almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her carnets in the libraries, from the Fnac to small downtown shops and has its identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the e-mails " , explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched a " Detour " exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own carnet.
In August, she also launched a lyopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and of this cultural aura, Moleskine has its diverse products: bags, agenda, styles, computer doors... The brand falls on a range of support.
A success has been achieved: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, against 9% for the entire population.
Disappointment?
"No, Mr. Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the Association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people. "
" The progress made for fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" Still there is enormous still to be done."
It must be said that for disabled unemployed people, there are many obstacles to accessing employment.
Instead, they are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the back and 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high: 53% for disabled people, up to 38% on average.
Brief, so many criteria that make the return to employment difficult and " constitute the core of the problem " according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the target brakes.
It remains the non-dit, the attitudes that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Company Association for the City indicated that questioned managers had " a low level of knowledge of disability " with " representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, more than 20 private companies are still far from achieving the employment objective of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a Law of... 1987.
The last known figures, which date from 2008, are 2.6 per cent.
"We are now around 3 per cent," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting corporate contributions that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also brought about real awareness-raising, particularly in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20-49 employees employed disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of 100- 199 employees.
Hazard: "Good luck"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they were looking for this friendly match.
We're not going to write that there's a connection between them, but the image is symbolic.
Assis near the street of the Auditorium of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have a nice and peaceful atmosphere.
Five months after his attack on Turkey, the Belgian elector has only elections to make.
"I am very happy about Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
On the contrary between its performances in the club and in the selection, "it's one thing, it's justified."
"A Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Born against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "bricker".
Not to be overlooked, however, is the notion of "making fun".
The Blues, he encouraged them from the age of 7 years and the 1998 and 2000 winning campaigns.
"I've always been sustained," he said.
It is strongly involved in further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
To the contrary, "he's in Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), ", he's rapelle-t-t.
"We crossed it all at once."
"You can play against them, it's just happiness!"
With bonhommy, Leekens has for his part mentioned by "fever".
"Fert" to argue "a match of gala."
"Fert" also to note - as "visin" - that France "has become a very high-level team" a little over a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will lack the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blues Direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report it during the next match." That against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento began with a lot of optimism to return to Bosnia (2200), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country " .
Paulo Bento has already seen it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Selectao, which has been in the Manats since September 2010, will qualify for the euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to get out.
Given the match going (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seemed obvious that the games were not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this goal so valuable that it would have rested.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked out."
But at their bright Stade of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public who should be so busy, even though the party clearly announces "very close "," said an optimist but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are all convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We will continue to have 50% chance of being in the euro 2012," when Carlos Queiroz's successor even relativized.
The zero report of Bosnia on Friday obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
There's no way enough for the Bosnians, who also need to be marked.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked for purpose abroad," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to impose maximum pressure on Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realist, this time.
