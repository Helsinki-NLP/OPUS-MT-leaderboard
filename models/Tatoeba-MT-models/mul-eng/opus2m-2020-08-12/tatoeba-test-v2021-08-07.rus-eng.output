That was my plan.
It was my turn to play, and my king didn't get attacked, it wasn't put under a spell, but none of my figures could move properly, so it was described as what they call "the King" or "the touch of the earth."
It wasn't an accident.
That wasn't completely unexpected.
It wasn't him.
I didn't translate it.

So it'll be easy to win.
It would be useless to do this.
That'd be possible.
It'd be safer staying here.
I wouldn't be surprised.
