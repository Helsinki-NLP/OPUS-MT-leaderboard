What's he doing?
Tom didn’t have the chance that you and I had.
Many birthday cards will soon arrive.
It's a personal wolf.
Saturday my father is open.
What he said upset us.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I don’t think anyone noticed what you did.
That's a nice pair of legs.
One, three, five are different.
Did they sign?
He needed water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never ate.
How many pens do you have?

That is not all.

She had blonde hair.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat lunch?
You're the wine.
I forgot about him.
The horse is in the woods.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where's Tom eating?
We have implemented that plan.
You had to attend the meeting.
You can read my letter and correct the errors if there is.
My conscience bothered me.
A number of homes were flooded with the river.
Why should I care about them?
Do you like your friend tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick thousands of paper cranes multiply, her wish will come true.
Tom forgot about them.
Don’t let it be for the train.
If you find something you're good with and what you're enjoying, it's a great thing.
You don't believe me.

Birds sing.
If the idiots were to compete, you'd come second, because you're too hard to get first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Brilliant!
They are in the library.
Tom would rather not have done it.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we're going to open up.

Our teacher started singing a good song.
We can't open everything.

We decided not to let them go.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your daughter.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I'm drinking tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I am not going to be in this environment to do it.
All we can point to is real, but what is real is the real question.

Please hurry up.
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.

I don't speak French well enough!
I can't go visit for a minute.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a tired, cold summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Let's go.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I too am unemployed.
Can I come over later?
Tom was very patient.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami corrected it last week.
What should we do about it?
The food is right.
I'm pulling my socks into a jacktrap.
Tom's trying to keep trying.
Tom won't watch it.
My horse is black.
If it's a lie, she's a liar.

Don't you add sugar?
I’m not afraid.
She's doing her homework now.
What will you bring to school today?

He's a man of faith.
Tom won't die.
I don't want to see you.
He's judging jazz.
When did you last agree?
She can answer your question.
Can I look at your card?
I wish you were near me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.

Thank you very much!
She seemed beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Keep the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.

Who said that?
Your name is listed first.
Is this necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?

My sister is beautiful.
With the sun’s rising, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?

Even Tom lied.
His music is familiar.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice. I'm not going to make what you're saying.
That's quite normal.
I love your son.
Empty queue will not be displayed.
I had to imagine myself.
Let's practice.
It was difficult for him to remove his pride, which he felt was his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he did not cure Mary.
The clock's down.
I can't get out of this cell.
I don't have time for you.

What would you have done if you were in my place?
I will be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of work.
I told Tom I'd be right now.
My son still believed in Kersvader.
I hate to drive.
Sami needs to wait a minute.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
It is dangerous to go into that area of your own.
Sami did not notice it.
Do you wash your hands?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my dad, do you?
Now I'm back with condoms.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.

I wouldn’t be so sure.
I kept dreaming about her.

I forgot about her.

I'm eating rice.
Sorry, can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It's raining.
Tom will be late.
I'm waiting for you to need a Daai rev.
I just bought a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The competition begins tomorrow.
They can overcome their fears.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom's gone.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my collection.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm gonna fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
This does not matter what he says, nor should he trust it.
You had to visit Kyoto.
I woke up when it was still dark.
Find out all you can about her.
I came here to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to think about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we were married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Let it be in grass, when the weather was red, windy and dark, and the coldest clothes could enter into the sea, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men entering the sea.
Night is all the cats grow.
Stiller!
It is my home now.
A bird flew.
He was 30 minutes late.
He went out to an English-Japan dictionary on the lecturer.
Whatever a man sows, he will also reap.
I want you to say that before.
I love my mother.
Tom won't answer.
I am much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I've been looking for a place to stay.
Tom had a lot on his desk.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We've forgotten the cleaning of her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example, Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's so funny!
The river flowing by Paris is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
