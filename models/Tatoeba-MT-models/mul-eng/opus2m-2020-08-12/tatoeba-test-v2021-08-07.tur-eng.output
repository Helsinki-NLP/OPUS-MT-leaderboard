There's his desk.
It's been the last year.
Her signature is bad.
He was hurt by his head.
Her heart is full of joy.
Her house is at the foot of Mount Fuji.

Her mother cleaned her bathroom.
His name has a very interesting meaning.
The purpose of life was to be a musician.
Her office is right there.
He works with his old Fiat gas.
He's different from me.
His thoughts are usually correct.
His thoughts and thoughts changed my outlook on life.
He's too weak to look at his family.
He has made its stately Rome and the poor of man's nature.
He didn't talk enough.
His speech convinced me that he knew so much.
It looks very nice to see her.
His wife left him and he was fired from his job.
He's taken my word with his spirit.
His little sister's married.
Mm-hmm.
Wait, I'll check.
Hold your breath, this is toxic gas.
The construction of the house can be preserved for a year in an inhospitable fridge.
He's been throwing home prices in the last ten years.
It's like a joke.
It really looks like a fairy tale.
Bals are usually activated at night.

I told Tom how Mary got home.
I told Tom I'd have to think about him.
Tell him I understand you're worried about Tom.
I told Tom I was just kidding.
I told him not to come to Tom.
I told Tom I didn't know the answer.
I told Tom that Mary was right.
I told Tom to call me.
I told Tom to listen.
I told Tom to see a doctor.
I told Tom to keep going.
I told you, but you didn't pay attention.
I told you to clean up your room.
I told you Tom wasn't busy.
It was just an hour.
I'm worried about him too.
I've had a 20-minute checkup.
I was interested in her cat.
I got a French degree in high school.
I saw French in high school.
He took her to the Queen of the Kingdom.
I've been looking forward to winning his race.
I was looking forward to Tom being there.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be there.
I was making sure Tom wouldn't do this.
I got my place at the end of the line.
I got my motive.
I got the book.
I went to a wrong bus.
I understand exactly what he's saying.
That proved that he was a thief.
It became clear as soon as Tom couldn't understand a lot of French.
The day she was born, the whole day was raining.
I'm training you two hours a day.
It really depends on when it's going to happen.
It's really a mess.
I tried it again, but it's empty.
I've tried a girl with a caridas.
I tried to sow it, but it was the only thing she wanted.
I tried to forget.
I tried to convince Tom to use the car.
It's a bad habit.
It's a market.
It's a nice day out there.
It's time to stop watching TV and it's over.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's a reason of war.
Cassus is clear.
It's up to me to see that it's over again.
It's a hard word to translate.
It's a big commercial for writing's tattoo.
Nice plan, at least on paper.
It's a great place to start.
This is a group effort.
It's almost no time.
Almost write it down.
It's been five years since I started working English.
That's already done.
It's great to win the prize.
It's a high-powered device.
Visit Tom's eyes to watch him play basketball.
It's cruel to hear people talking loud in a library.
It's an old joke, but it's good.
This is an old pattern that uses hidden internal circuits.
It's a continuous process.
This opportunity will come to a person's feet in 100 years.
Such an opportunity will pass into the hands of the man once.
This is an opportunity to come once and for all.
It's a perfect place to start.
I'm sorry Tom didn't come here today.
It's sad Tom's too young to die.
It's a pleasure to be able to help you.
It's a pleasure to be here.
It's a political engineer.
This is a popular holiday.
It's Nisan today.
It's a matter of public security.
That's a short way to school.
That's a little problem.
It's a step forward.
It's a treasure.
That's a creepy animal.
It's a joke.
It's not natural to talk when you're full of it.
That's because he loves me.
That's why you don't want to be alone.
It was a spring morning.
It's been a long time since I last saw you.
It was a good year.
It's been a hard year for me.
It's been a very difficult year.
It's hard not to do anything like that.
These are cold weather.
These are hot air.
It's raining since yesterday morning.
It's been a few years since I was camping.
It's been two years since I last saw her.
He's been very hot lately.
It's best to make calls from someone from the world.
It's better than being alone with a few idiots.
It's better to drink before you get over it.
It scares me a little.
Of course he didn't know what Tom was supposed to do.
Cassus is clear.
It's cold today.
It's dark here.
It's hard to analyze.
It's hard to get out of the car in the cold mornings.
It is easy to fall prey to the desires and actions of others.
It's easy to make love.
It looked like a dog's table.
It seemed like a lot of trouble.
Looks like you're all wrong.
He looks like he understands the truth.
He looks like he's lying.
The rain looks like it's raining.
They seem tired of marriage life.
It looks like you won me.
Until we're done.
It's our turn.
I'm warning you.
It's fun to watch you dance.
The time of the game.
It's getting harder to follow what happened.
That's gonna be a shame.
It'll be sunny after breakfast.
It'll be worthless.
It'll be hotter after this.
It's great to be here.
It's great to be coming.
It's great to be here.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
It's hard to find a good place to live.
It's hard to find a job in the U.S.
It's hard to think of a life without a pet.
It's hard to say no to them.
It's hard to sell houses that need repair today.
It's hard to tell you something.
It's hot outside.
It's hot outside.
It won't take more than half an hour to do it.
It's impossible to love him.
It's just a time break.
It's like hot air, isn't it?
It's like being in a sugar shop.
It's probably going to rain today, so it'd be better if you get your shirt.
It's like selling tarts.
The station is more than three miles away.
There's a deadly heat today.
I'm on my way to talk.
It's never right to do this.
It's good to be a role model for others.
It's nice to imagine.
It's good to see the dream.
It's just nice to talk to you like that.
It's nice to see you again years later.
It's night here, but it's day in Boston.
It's not a secret she's been lying under.
He's not a good car, but he's a car.
It's not all bad.
It's not always that easy to do the right thing.
It's not that simple.
It's not too bad.
It doesn't look good.
Not much, but it's never better.
It's not possible to live forever.
I don't think so.
I don't want to go, I can't watch going.
He's not sincere.
It's no use trying to convince him.
It's been snowing all day.
It's been snowing all night.
There was snow in Osaka.
It's time.
Today's payday.
There's no rain on her divorce.
Very soon.
It's very wild.
It's really scary.
He's really hot.
It's really disgusting.
It's said there's gonna be a new airport in town.
He said Tokyo was a very safe city.
Tokyo is said to be a very safe city.
It's said Tokyo is a very safe city.
What they wrote about him in the newspapers is shocking.
It's raining in Boston now.
It's easy to say "I love you" for Americans, but it's nothing to do in China.
The air's so cold.
He's still hot.
Write in Paris.
Write it down.
It started with a kiss.
That's the best for me.
He's the best French restaurant in New York.
It's time to pay.
Now's the time to count.
Now's the time to pay.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time for us to leave this place.
It's time to go to bed, so close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
Party time.
It's time to welcome Tom.
It's time to start.
This is where the human mouth is breaking.
This is Tom's only chance.
The air's hot.
It's too late to do this now.
Now it's too late to get back.
It's too late to visit them.
He's too quiet.
It's a bad thing to be kidding.
We didn't realize Tom was here so early.
It's very cold in this room.
It's too cold today, isn't it?
It's easy to worry about you, isn't it?
He's very busy.
It's very romantic!
This is hot all year.
The air's hotter.
It's written in Croatian.
You're always gonna love me.
It's left for you to go.
It took us a whole week to paint the garage.
It took a long time to understand what he said.
It took five minutes to get to the station.
He spent four months recovering from his illness.
It took me hours to do this.
It took a long time to decide where we're going.
He took time to correct the problem.
It took a while to increase your speed, but now it's time to get caught.
It turned out she was a beautiful day.
It's always been.
It's always been.
It was a bad experience.
It's a hard prison to sleep.
It was a cold night.
Ticari was obviously very expensive.
That wasn't a big argument.
It was a terrible experience.
He was a virtuous man.
It's too late.
It was a mistake to stay.
It was an incredible feeling.
I'm sorry he didn't come to our party.
It's a very exciting moment.
That was a strange feeling.
That was a terrible day.
He visited his eyes.
His pursuit was very surprising.
Until Martha was cold here.
It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?
It's hard for you, isn't it?
All right.
It was easy to find his office.
It was like I was hoping for everything.
It was exactly what I expected.
It was like I was hoping for everything.
It was exactly what I expected.
The air was very cold.
It's hard to say goodbye, isn't it?
It was an accident.
It was the matter.
He was lucky, and we got tickets for the concert.
That's what I wanted.
I'm the one who wants it.
It was Mike who called the police.
He was boring.
He was my last show.
It wasn't as easy as we expected.
It wasn't as easy as we hoped.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his word.
He wasn't important to me.
It wasn't their first time.
It wasn't Tom who did it.
He was one of the great discoveries in my knowledge.
That was on the list.
He could've been prevented.
It wasn't really a problem.
He's really funny.
It was like he was doing this to her.
She was so secretive.
He was still there.
It was a "woe uncle" memory.
Buying our house was Tom's idea.
It's Tom who told me that.
She was so soft.
There was no rain yesterday.
He was worth the test.
Mike took this rocket yesterday.
It'll be a long night.
It'll be over in one or two days.
It'll be getting cold tomorrow.
It's gonna cost you $100.
It'll only take a minute.
It'll probably rain.
It'll rain in the woods.
It won't be as hard as you thought it would be.
It's not gonna be easy, but it's possible.
It won't be hard.
The air won't be open.
He won't come to her.
He worked hard again.
Thank you, Tom!
It's sad if we're not allowed to do this.
It'd be nice to give a party.
It'll be hard to do it.
It would have been so easy to do this.
That wouldn't be appropriate.
I understand that Tom's got a program, but if I can get a date from him, I really appreciate it.
I understand both of you.
I understood everything.
I used to clean up my people's wife.
I used one.

I have to get you out of here.
I have to go meet him.
I have to go to the hospital.

I wish you had told me the truth.
I'm looking forward to your next visit.
I wish you were here.
I wish you hadn't done it.
I've always been up before.
I always woke up before my watch.
I woke up with my headache this morning.
I woke up in a situation where my shirt was stuck in the shape of my shirt.
I was wondering why Tom was here.
I was surprised that Tom didn't tell Mary to do this.
I wonder how Tom managed to win.

Who is to blame for this?
Who's responsible for this, I wonder.
I'm surprised you're gonna take a dance like Tom.
I wonder who will win.
I wonder why no one's telling the truth.
Why is this so expensive?
I wonder why it's so expensive.
I wonder why Tom gave it to me.
