28-year-old Cook found in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who was recently taken to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm him, "It finally went up to him again."
The Leichnam found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified by 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, sharing the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was committed as a murder and the investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, shared with the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston six months ago, had his dream job as a cook in the Sun & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker from the Sun & Daughters said that she "would be shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a good family and we will miss him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and policies are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank lived in hostels for the first time, but that "the things went up for him at last."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a big heart.
His kind of connection with his family was always to cook something to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of replacement.
He was the brother who got tired of the power.
"With everything that's going on in the world, he was this immaculate diamond that lit up light every day," he said.
Anyone who has the information in this case will be asked to call the SFPD’s guidance phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be stuck in boots
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star in an interview has now made it perfectly clear.
"I'll always be hidden in drawers or picked up by outside labels that have to do with me and the reality at least."
"I don't have the will myself, always perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more expensive to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actor spends most of his time at home, in the form of a television set with loud noise and Mexican food, it is called in the magazine.
To white glut they ask the question after the children's wedding: "We don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is no child game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Longer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is over-visible.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little difference with an exit on the beach.
For the 58 years, it was a premium.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration evening, they were hunting in the quick gallop to get home to the foothills.
A mile at this time, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the race careers ended then again.
On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournaments - again near horses.
He managed to drive with his family over the ALRV facility, never forced on a horse to take photos.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
The German sport aid transferred the man from Anhausen to the Golden Sports pyramid under a small gala.
There is no need for the sympathetic sporter.
Bundesverdenskreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already kissed him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first priest of Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This appointment means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be granted not only for sports success but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting growth.
And that's how he also paid the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the two US master winners were included on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of the German Sport".
The outstanding are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, fat Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Puch and Arnd Schmitt, Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Faher Meinhard Taker, Judoka Frank Wiene, Springer Alvin Schockewell and posthum of the handballer Erhard Marvel.
Many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the ill-equipped company traveled to Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza price was loved.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
At the same time, both US presidential candidates are involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, previously philosophical difference.
He's over the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt smaller and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will return to regulations massively, and it will work hard for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
In contrast, Clinton says: The State has certain tasks to do, it has opportunities to open up and need money for it.
That's why taxes would increase for the rain, they say.
Both of them are very close to infrastructure.
The investment needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the state-critical theater flights of the Republicans.
So there could still be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and raise coal supply in the United States again.
Oil promotion should also be possible in protected areas as long as the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is to be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly build renewable energy with its investment programme and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
However, not only with infrastructure - also with international trade agreements are the two competitors not far away from each other.
TPP, the cross-border trade agreement, does not want both to sign.
At the same time, both the United States and the United States do not want to isolate themselves from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They should be better paid, then, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry wage.
They want to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says, "The minimum wage must be paid, then he says he shouldn't be changed."
However, the major discussion in the coming months must be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to drive the economy and the citizens out of it, is in order to boost growth.
His critics were holding him back so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that's a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks with great eyes curious in the room.
His mother's on the desk.
Until she realizes she'll be watched.
She smiles short and tastes the little ones.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional business leader of Condrovs, a social assistance provider in Bayern, and is involved, inter alia, with the issue of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich North in one of the few decentralised apartments for single women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs joined Profami and the Münchner Women's Aid.
Not long ago she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not excessive to say that every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they suffer from torture or death or because their families send them as hope fighters to Europe," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for fleeing: "Many secretly steal because they do not see any other way out".
In their home they have experienced sexual violence, rape, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
On the flight, it's going on.
"That slipper, for example, requires sexual action for a bottle of water, is not rare," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that it will end when they arrive in Germany, irere, tells Bahr.
Here too, self-employed women in refugee communities would often be considered to be less valuable and in need of harm.
This means that about 90 percent of women who live in the apartment in Munich north of Munich are traumatized.
"Some of the children are certainly not freely created."
Many women were so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because shame is too great."
Since they often didn't want to help themselves, it only takes more accommodation for them, requires Bahr.
In Bayern, the seven regional governments are responsible for the transfer of refugees.
On the question of whether they were from a similar project like in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered with no.
There is no such thing in the suburbs and overfarms in the provinces of the governments.
Even in Swaben only refugee women are not subject separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In overseas, sub- and central branches there are some community-based warehouses or their own houses only for self-employed women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bayern, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be subject separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy or men and women are brought together, there can be - continuing - violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
As the women are much more concerned with this need for protection, they can be relieved of the tension that is present at the house in Munich.
"Since he talked to us about it, we have a long waitlist," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assisted regions: Requirements for new labour struggle measures
The representatives of the assistant doctors have called for their cooperation to approve new labour combat measures in their conflicts with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to adopt more action to combat unemployment from early September.
The JDC stated that it would have been preferable by the Minister to take care of the contract.
In July doctors and medical students agreed on the conclusion of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in favour of the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCort said that the government would remain "slowly" to problems, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully cancel the proposed new contract and require formal renegotiation to all your concerns."
In response to the government's weakness, the JDC Board today has submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of work-related measures beginning in September.
The conflicts led to the six times this year's assistants, the first total cases in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malwana, Head of the BMA Assistant Doctor, followed the election to abolish the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He shared with BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, with the aim of benefiting from the Treaty and adopting it.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of Foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent into custody in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reward most.
There was the handgun, yeah.
But Putin's smiles seemed squeaky, and he hardly fired out heat, even for his remaining circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke again of his "love Friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have taken up as if something had never happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But one of Putin's exciting, sustainable coolies showed that the Head of State of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the Committee of a Russian Aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was burning.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
It was even bigger because it was handled by a common friend.
It is difficult to rebuild the Vetrau again if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media launched a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
On one occasion it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
The most serious allegations were made by leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria, which was controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He's fought this very hard.
But in St.Petersburg the official message said it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to conquer a kind of victory.
For Ankara the benefits of a gun stand are clear.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get in the first line after his last month in a split state strike almost hit his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shot him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have severely affected Turkey - in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has gone down by almost 90 %.
Travellers and charter companies will be facilitated in Russia when the flights are re-emerged.
They count on a later seasonal storm on the Mediterranean.
This week the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated the following: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is famous for its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response.
To this end, the continued noise over the cut-off period of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to derive benefits from the cold vote and reduce Turkey's relationship to the west.
The Russian Head of State has certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is well-known for Moscow, a self-evidentity, which itself has a profound fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this glancing palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it once described to me as an analyst, to represent "allian Alliance of Foreigners": two countries that are confused and treated badly and are now connected.
However, despite the public humiliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played its role as peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be noted that, after almost three hours of initial discussions, both Presidents observed at the press conference that they had not even discussed the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than the NATO member Turkey has launched the Russian campaign - it is certainly better to speak to each other at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS mark is to be reduced to a back office role according to the bank's head.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan shared with the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it had to be collated and rescued almost eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial brands.
It supported international sport with millions of dollars on sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the bourgeois notation are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will become more important - Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with him: "The RSB brand will be on our market as well as on the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals but pursue local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.
RBS has already stated that its Six Nations Sponsoring will no longer continue and that it will increase the reliability of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop ourselves into the market bank, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the President.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000 winnings at Newmarket
Dettori says Champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000 gains
The Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000 British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He placed a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night, which was trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, which reaches the milestone in the wing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edry and Willie Carson.
The three-year-old winner Dettori, who won Ghaiyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I was born here 30 years ago.
It's not big meetings, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banana breakfast night with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very sensitive.
Dettori picks up the jubel when he holds the victory at Predelection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the barrier race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine visitors, had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the moderns and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that has just arrived before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intelligence that separates him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a great messenger for race, his enthusiasm and charisma loves fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 profits if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jocky!
Frankie has already been winning in GB for nearly 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality that is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible Jocky.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finish to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the exception of the British flag race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had initially had difficulties when he returned from his six - month course, but he showed an impressive character strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end - Dettori once said he wanted to continue in competition until he was at least 50 years old.
Russia Putin Fires Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his former chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's first trust crisis for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Kremlin it is stated that Putin "has appointed Ivanov's discharge of his duties as president of the Russian Presidial Administration".
Anton Vaino, who has been a member of Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he completed his studies at the so-called State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the mission in Tokyo.
On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he was later the Chief of Protocol and Head of Staff of Government.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thank you for trusting me."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your work as Head of State in the implementation of legislation and control of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared with the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has taken Moscow's secret weaponry.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and worked as he worked for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was returning to his own will.
But despite the delay in the camera, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here's the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was first appointed as a potential president once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - stood on a large scale.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to trust me with these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
He was a Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, as Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy representative.
As Putin gained power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was first accepted that Ivanov could be President of Russia's second term of office after Putins, since a third term of office had broken down Putins against the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another nearby bound Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin was president of the Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson burned after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical replacement at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, was publicly charged on Thursday before his release.
In the set it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I'll take care of the case," he said in a message.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents will be published according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which is expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old who played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg was the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have covered my whole heart for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but this will be no longer possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, players, our wonderful Crew and, above all, the best fans who can only wish for a series.
The planned explosion of the 12th staff is scheduled on 28 September.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
A resident of Banff asked for assistance in identifying the fish that grew up in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be the 75 fish of Sandals that were excavated by a spring fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two long-distance fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with five
The £ 1.35 billion of your project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected with five.
It is the first of four conclusions of the "covered glass" that the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge draws near.
The brake section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 pieces of iron.
The £ 1.35 billion of your project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viadukt and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerance for the passage.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks at its place and the last section of the deck today in Rossyth are getting a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be mounted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first conclusion at each bridge project is a significant milestone.
This fantastic project represents future high- and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the north tower deck in construction, we had to close the remaining gaps on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by drawings from the north coastal coastal bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and simultaneously very soft activity.
Massive because the Viadukt is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be drawn up at an increase of about 3% above.
Heikel, since the tolerances on which the team worked were different - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Rescue in the Moelfree Bay: Three Men Have "Happy to Be Still in Life"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after being shot by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the morning at 13:20 BST Alarm after a Crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat circled around her neighborhood and presented us with the worst," said the director of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong wind has already pushed the boat out of its range until we leave it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was created at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boje without rescue.
They all arrived on board the coastal repair boat and were brought back to rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were cast into the water have suffered unharmed and still live.
However, the boat engine had an emergency line, but it was released at the centre of the boat by the person who controlled the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - Man clings to his ex-friend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the keys to his apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic father cuts off his ex-freundin's clothes.
When this came into the apartment, he stepped on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the aunt.
During the 50's his ex-friend's clothes collapsed, he called his mother.
This alarmed her sister.
Together with her life-threatening brother, the 45-year-old wanted to calm down.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life-threatening menace.
On the street they hit the man's ex-life risk.
When the two women returned to the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and touched his ex-friend.
Who makes Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPDs and Greens: In the future, investors will be taken a lot more seriously into the obligation.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 valuable apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "handling concept" for the next Council meeting.
However, conflict has been programmed.
In the first line it is about the question: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There's still a problem.
SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to show 20% of all apartments in the future as social housing."
However, the affordable apartments can also be found in the archive.
However, the main point of dispute in the Council was, Bratmann: "How are you going with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent of these areas, but at least 20 per cent of the apartments can be built as social housing."
A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and must still be financed, should provide for incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "There is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants investors to make as little rules as possible.
The link will still want hard charges for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann is concerned about the deterioration of the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the experts.
However, the programme is still not complete: because there are about 1260 new apartments that should be built without delay.
How, though, does the loss of some 1300 more affordable apartments, whose promotion will be completed in the next few years?
Only by 2020 will there be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now buy out existing connections from the city.
In addition, it had to be taken into account to get the apartments back into the price chain.
This is possible in the West City.
On one occasion, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, it's going to be a year.
About 1800 apartments could be returned to the price chain for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners don't want the housing companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City will again be dramatically increased, you are away from the purpose of the so-called mix.
A concentration of social awareness in just a few urban areas should no longer be given.
The Greens calculate that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be on board."
However, they have focused themselves on more trees for single-family homes.
However, this does not mean that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that rewards
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their freedom to starve on screens, has been blamed by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was first on the TV, then limited to video games and finally on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in freedom are not exclusive to each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (there were a series of characters, games cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest before the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand began July.
The market introduction in other countries was driven by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players with their smartphones go out looking for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found, they can be "photographed" (over a screen shot on the phone) or " caught".
A generation that played the game when she was younger closed the car and jumped to search for the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "medium" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, soon shared the Washington Post with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people who follow each day training 30 minutes from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the red data on performance increase.
Many public health awareness campaigns, which people want to bring to it "it takes 30 minutes to get from Sofa" and "to be active every day" are on deaf ears because many public health messages are slow and come from people who look nice.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who run regular sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Body employment helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something free of fun.
So three health chairs are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always there are sad players who must always complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's going on?
There's been a break.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its journey and the use will end with time.
However, as a result of Pokemon's success, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active value in the real world and help many people to be more active, fatter and healthy.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dammurnen
Forget the print.
Forget about the hip.
Simone Billes is immune to everything.
It's dynamic on the jumper.
I don't care about the bar.
It's amazing on the ground.
All line brilliant.
And now finally, too, the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American tournament won the title on Thursday, and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the screenlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver Medal Winner and the "Final Five" Men's Camera Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal Winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women, Simone Biles, are on the swimming pool during the women's solo match at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Billes is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and in total the five, while she determines her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She went out in tears as her final result was shown and her long journey was finally over.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought her sports to new heights:
Billes has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world-medium medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of respect and precision that the 1984 Olympicser Mary Lou Retton said of her "She's the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between the cars and the rest of the athletes, but rather between you and a lot of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold would be viewed as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman won each gold and silver in the women's unique match final at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Bills held the first medal on Tuesday, while she served at the decision-making ceremony of the late March Karolii's male coordinator.
Although Bills were able to do it, while their long way to the top never planned the future, that is not true.
A part of her ground exercise - which includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is based on Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside of the Olympics in Rio.
That's not an accident.
This girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament was trained in the Boorman.
Since summer 2013, she has lost no more multi-competitive competition, a series of winnings that will be held as long as Bill wants.
Even if Mustafina could easily lead through two strokes, the picture disappeared.
Swimming bars and basements - in which the world master title is held by Billes.
She stood up again with 15,433 on the swimming pool - and placed another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman greeted her kindly as she looked forward to her outcome - a pure formality - and tears flowed bright red, white and blue Eiels when the vision she had just described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a strike for the last four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medals went to Mustafina in a thiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old manhunt named "Oma" had a origin.
After her funeral she became the public of Kusshande, overcome by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Billes is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds at the beginning of this week has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims of serial murder shots in the car at the music party
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks of a decade in the first series of murders by Phoenix while they were in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked on a road, the authorities said.
The father fired eight shots from a handgun while he stood on the side of the car and flew along with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police shared that the three-time murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker from Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooter led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven persons were mainly killed in Hispanic residential areas within four months of nine attacks and two more injuries.
"It happens in a residential area before a house," Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, shared with him early in the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown nose from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah are still dead.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup print half an hour before the three-time murder and was released from the fact that it was the work of the serial killer.
Suddenly, patterns were found and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with Microzephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-old Edmund Piccito loves the song, toys and of course his mother.
But as the least of his peers, Edmund Microzephalia, the result of a genetic disorder, knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Piccito during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought I didn't.
I can't make it.
I didn't get involved in it.
What doesn't even agree -- of course you've been involved in it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were informed that Edmund could never recognize them under circumstances and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest institutionalising him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,' Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit or chat until his third year of life and can't talk.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can run with support and drive.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought about "Please sing something ahead of me."
"We bring him sign language," said Piccioto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says.
Microzephalia has a variety of causes: genetically such as endmund and infections with viruses such as Maserne or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is still too early to tell how the life of the infected with the Zikavirus will be affected.
Piccito remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going on?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know it.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to tell me anything.
But Picciuto has a promising advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain cases, overwhelming is allowed to save in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain cases and massive floods in Louisiana forced the governor to withdraw the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated on the whole Saturday with more rain cases.
Many rivers in the south of Louisiana and the south of the Missippis crossed their shores and flowed with massive floods to extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to help the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that the demands for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that only the town of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
An overwheat warning system is used in large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service allowed for additional 3 to 5 duties in this area to fall on rain.
In southern Alabama, a river early warning system was used on Friday, while it was still calculated in the area of mobile.
The Fluss Committee near Baton Rouges and the Fluss Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekly record score.
Meterologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could cross many houses in the front area near Baton Rouge.
He also said that an overwhelming overwhelming in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it is only slowly flowing over the river into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest point on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still feed people from the river in the Amite and Wilkinson areas in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his step son were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly over the night.
He said that he had been warned by another stepfather who lived nearby.
"We are awake and the water flows and flows here," said Hansford.
It reached my size.
His wife said that she had never seen such a height of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family had all their problems and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three of them in a large military truck and had brought them to the next firehouse in Gloster, where they were buried until Friday.
Krautmann said that overwhelming had "greatly spread" as there were still severe floods and that the authorities were looking for evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 C.E.
Krautmann said that the soil has been thoroughly exhausted by the rain cases since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe floods and street floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangapahoa Parish and educational disasters in five school areas.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a co-ordinator in Tangapahoa 200 overcrowded houses offered.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches that were now overwhelmed.
The president of the municipality, Robby Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who were paid for by high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, note rooms were set up to accommodate the evacuations.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the town of Tangapahoa, almost two thousand roads were closed because of the high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take care of, hoping to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last great overwhelming we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Accounts said it was still on the golf course.
According to its data, a hand-full houser should be reported as overweight on Thursday, but not yet reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amiti, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "by bulleted through", survived skiing in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia this week has already been the second time a 6-year-old child is arrested.
The boy's parents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The elders indicated that Brown had suffered several explosions, including in the country, leg, arm and bow, but that he was in the hospital with consciousness when he was transporting him to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was beaten by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez shared with the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the young man was critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to be cured again.
He was supposed to start the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were arrested in Germanytown.
Three men were also arrested: two in age 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in a stable state.
The young man was arrested at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were not sure if they could be among the wounded men of the aunts.
CBS Philadelphia immediately shared that it seemed to have come into a crossfire between several shields.
Patterns for noise waves which have been returned to different noise waves shall be replaced by the totort.
It seems that this has clearly been about an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there are holes.
So it seems that several armed fighters who were very active here," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also found in the area.
There were no arrests and the police were currently checking reports following the monitoring video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a quarriesman on his arm when she played before her house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's getting up and the police are looking for another suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I think of under the Women's Olympics in the tournament and this for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984 I have been so dominant in every summer Olympic and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this man has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this man, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, becomes proud.
This man finally reflects the United States.
It confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence on the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments has been an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and 2.2.
It shows strength.
During the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was an amazing Olympic winer and American.
Now the world was able to be witnesses of the incredible performance of the three world masters Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most mastered Gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who was won at an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Men's member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the peaks of this sport, but this is not how tournaments are seen throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all go the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into an Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Besides, this is the last year with Martha Karoliyy as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a nice sport and tournaments are first held in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents, who are provided for training, institution, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can be kept on.
The majority of these tournaments are in well-being places that can support the business.
In this union, the tournament receives its entire training and this is a valuable and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tournament.
We need to provide the communities with countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a more efficient and easily accessible tour.
I've been building my tournament for 20 years.
At my events we have provided free and fast tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer the young high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from these great Olympic sports.
Towers develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this man to bring thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournaments and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such a exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic Men's Gold and thanks to making so many young girls with different background to start their way, become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further lines after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by the adoption of a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 assistants who voted in favour of a election were left behind.
In July Hunt planned to force the contract into force and said that NHS was in a "Non-country" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants should receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care for irregular hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistive Doctors, gave a speech last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will accompany the current population crisis and it will be refused to treat all doctors properly."
In just eight weeks, which remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks are being made by the government to participate in conflicts and sometimes on unhindered weaknesses.
This was the case with a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made in the last month that his door would always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, raise the tension and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to take further action.
The last strike at the end of April saw an outbreak of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 terms, since nurses and professionals were involved in providing doctors with coverage on the street poster.
The ministers hoped that the debate on the changes could be ended by the adoption of the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly allowance for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures are not enough, but are already overloaded teams and service providers and are preparing patients, caregivers and their families for only concerns, needs and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and responded positively to concerns about the Presidency and the Whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in education, additional training for those who returned from a professional period, training costs, mutual recognition of the learning plan, continuing training leave and gender-specific cases in medicine - would be a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that reduces the risk of heart disease
Thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to use this more people for a longer period of time.
The withdrawal medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart disease for people with heart disease.
The medicine is already administered 12 months after heart failure, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year commitment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year commitment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 150,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of solid materials in the artery walls forming the premises.
If the tablet is abnormal, it can cause a bleeding disorder that prevents the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.
When the blood vessels are dissolved, it can flow through the blood stream and hide the blood flow into the brain which causes a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at greater risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The NICE guide design, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice-day intake of Aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, there are a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart rate can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with Aspirin is effective in reducing further heart disease and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance draft does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Lets Elections flourish in Muslim Areas
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year on receipt of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote-making in Muslim communities to be considerably ignored as a devastating government report has been published today.
The former member of the cabinet Sir Eric Pickles, the police, electoral observers and councillors, took the initiative to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to "consensitivity with regard to ethnia and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said that it would be so bad to bribe voters for religious reasons that the police should be allowed to set up blockades outside electoral cabinets to protect protected voters.
He recommends that voters should conduct an exhibition with themselves to prove their identity when they choose.
In time, an elector must only name and address his name.
The report suggests that undeterred ink be placed on a person's finger when they issue their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistbleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to Community documentation and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This applies not only to electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial exploitation culture which is involved," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
In recent years, a special election has been decided that the Acting Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be brought into line with the corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had violated the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a sinuous manner and in a way" and that he had brought his critics with racist and Islamophobiaal accusations.
Rahman should "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either questionable or the consequence of a delay in which one person chooses as another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the corrupt letter election - when the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to overcome the electoral system, including the conduct of exhibitions to prove identity
In its report it says: "As evidence has been given that pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities has been exercised, in particular women and young people, in order to select, in accordance with the will of the elders, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"It was thought that... state institutions had deliberately ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" sensitivity towards ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to overcome the system, including the prohibition of political activists working out patent data to stop "pants".
The report drawn up by Theresa May also requires further registration checks to prevent the use of the list of options for immigration and social employment.
Take into account options to ask voters before the selection after your presentation.
No remote ink is used on a person's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter failure.
It is prohibited for political activists to make complete mistakes of letters and translations of letters.
The police have the power to set up roadblocks to electoral stations.
A legislative amendment which facilitates complaints of fraud in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 (Vol. Act 1983).
Photography ban in electoral stations.
The requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees implement the rule that voters go to the election cabinet alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that no criminal evidence has been filed after the Tower of Hamlet's case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his representative responsible for corrupt and illegal practices on behalf of a Lithuanian citizen," he said.
He was found guilty of several reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure - for sufficient reasons.
He also criticises the unimpeded "back control" of the electoral divisions of the knights.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden proliferation of electoral fraud and the lying of some authorities jeopardise this good call.
Back to Kates Radler-Dopplinger and other famous Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are talking this week about the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the border and band, who has proved to be an impressive double player in the Herzogin of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is not the only athlete to fight for gold, which shows its own famous double player - at least not if you can give social media faiths.
For the honour of the Olympic games in Rio and all the famous faces who are currently playing on our screens, F.C. has created a list of Olympics that show more than one similarity to Hollywood.
The Jäger and the Wolf: A member of the U.S. Men's team in the left, Brady Elison, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kates doublingerin on the railway, many people on the Internet have shown how a certain protection of the twinling of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The crew member of the US team in the Bogenschichen Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter after he has raised images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret.
In fact, the protection of the bogey was brought to the attention of the social media and said that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity on my own, except for facial recognition," Brady shared the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'll take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become more and more central this year: the striking similarity between the British broad racer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes should be able to walk as a double player for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Stefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African Swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "aesthetic version" of the Inception Player
A further continuous comparison was drawn between Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and player Josh Hartnett, which shows similar severe eye injuries and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to match a "aesthetic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Footballstar Hope Solo, left, and Right Player Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also felt the same.
Theory put in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US footballstar Hope Solo and the Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter have an incredible face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jengings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of actor Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, which shows her own beautiful, wide smiles that are similar to the bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentary for the Olympic Games apologizes for its statement that Chinese Swimmer "as a woman has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Free Wi-Fi Fountain Monitor of the CBC Live Transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese Swimmer "is falling apart" and during the race as "a woman died".
Commentary Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free Wi-Fi stop.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBS Board's Commentary Team to give more "colour", was able to say, "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
To stand up, go away like a cow, die like a whore.
Thank you.
The Chinese Swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second stage of the Swimming Table 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Rock, which enabled the Canadians to close the jumps to China.
Visitors across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "The CBC commenter just said that the 14-year-old Swimmer from China "is dead like a woman"?????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m women's freestyle swimming pool as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Critics against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard, where many put him to talk
Twitter users didn't stand back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC transmission, lived for MacDonald's comment and said, "We are sorry that the comment was made about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it's happened."
CBC blamed himself over 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Mr Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about the comments of MacDonald
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to express them.
Yesterday night we were quickly blamed by our observers for sending and our followers to the social media.
To clarify, Byron's comments are about the performance of the Swimmer and not about them as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said is very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mail and tried to justify his comment by noting that it was not his intention that she would be subjected to personal assault.
"I would like to take a moment to excuse myself for the comment I made after the women's wet stick in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I've been referring to the performance of the Swimmer and not to them as a person."
Of course, there was no misunderstanding and I'm sorry."
Buyers in Primark hire a woman who approves unscathed treatment in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman threw her clothes in the middle of a primary market to try underhouses.
In order to make the situation worse, she insisted on how she looked at it, took it out and put it back in the regular.
She also stepped forward and tried four pairs of underhossens in a business in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in folkstone.
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in folkstone, where the woman approved the underhospital before she put her back into the regular
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in the business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the undercover, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
While standing on the sales area, she took a couple underhossen out of the building, pulled out her own stormhouses and hosses and tried.
"She didn't even try to find a place of disparity to do it - she just stood there, asking like Oskar."
"Everybody died when they pulled out the underhospital again, which obviously didn't fall because they put it back in the regular."
She repeated the same with three other underhospitals before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, she cried again and came out.
"They didn't seem to disturb that they noticed - or think about the person who would buy the underhouses they had approved."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How hard it is to think that someone would take the underhospitable home with someone who touched another person and who wasn't washed."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I came along, the employees have tried to get the clothes off the sale after she left - which is so good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new couple of underhospitables and find out that another woman touched them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primmark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkstone."
All products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Weapons Attacks With Maga
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We speak with Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga League in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbery near the distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the mirror for your driver.
If you are being dragged from the back, then you should turn around as the first to see your attackers and "take yourself out of the shell line," says Mizrachi.
Then get the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free ellbogen face.
Then hit him with the knife into the arm and turn while the attacker gathers his weapons out of his hands. Hit him with the walk into his face and move him back as they direct the weapon to him.
When attackers are approaching, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shell line, grab the gun and turn it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time lower the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before they move back and turn the gun on him.
Sounds hard?
Watch the video to see exactly how it is formed by Mizrachi.
But think it's safe to spend your money on a robbery - unless you are a master of magic.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his voice for a traveler in Europe's most dirty places
A British traveler undertook his immune system and Würgeflex a severe test - by blocking some of Europe’s most dirty and desolatest places.
The Moderator and Traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, created his trains on a Euro scale, a country on Piccadilly Circus, a train ticket button and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before looking at each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to be on.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to our day.
The thought of turning off the trigger button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely gone, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen game.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind that he had swallowed, more than a bad aftershock in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his dreams by traveling through the world and by his own and wonderful things.
From public countries at railway stations to trailers of toilets, its immune system was definitely subject to a test
In the film he said: "As a child, I was relatively concerned about my health and I hid everything I could in my mouth, earth, water and water."
In the film he was entitled to his call in any case.
The only thing he could do was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His testabstrich showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to take off after his Luminometer number had dropped over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands showed up one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I've ever done in a toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to touch anything here because it's inside of me.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company replaces Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk sugar bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of dark bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, soaps and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We led crazy brainstormings that ended up saying "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in dry health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of dry health and how they are related to the immune system.
The growing interest in nursing health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's government, added: "Let me tell you so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had liked some of the things I'd shown him like the yellow Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that were easier to get Ian to touch and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we took some of these dirty toys on film."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of all milk sugar bacteria in question, in particular with the benefit of Magen and Darm and 58%, said that they used at least occasionally products containing added milk sugar bacteria.
Asiole family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
One social family lost their social apartment after a demolition with a damage of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were shot after a long list of complaints of their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked employees of the housing company found their property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking gaps, wooden pieces were raised, Müll was spread on the floor and graffiti was washed on the walls.
The family was surrounded and it is accepted that they now live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, since this presence is likely to be seen as not as beautiful as part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and her call is similar.
The couple had three children who lived between the apartment and the police said that the terrorist that had added the family included street fights with baseball fighters, hostages of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, conflicts and refugees.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which will be removed under circumstances, old müll was found
It was in the possession in which drugs were treated in the past, the wood cuts up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and they had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing delogged her and her partner this week violently from the presence after they had given them an extended period of 11 weeks to freely out.
The delegates were greeted by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made for hell.
One said, "They're worried about no one."
We lived with them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it was intended for the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were regularly called, for 20 years
Müll and old toys were dropped on the upper side of the community house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, since a delegation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be severely measured.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and members of the community who have come to us with courage and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will be spent by some neighbors and the message is that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three children had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty matrice that will be returned to one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
The workers of the household management will now have to leave Müllbergs surrounded by the house
In 2014, the police led a Razzia into the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as waagen, paraphernalia and bar money of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been known for possession of a drug in class B in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone was her son Lee Skeldon, who came back to life in 2013.
After they were unconscious, it will be concluded that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they're going to be delegated to tenants who don't respect the rules of the house.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall's police shared that delegation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not respect the rules of the house.
"This is for those who think they can handle themselves without self-interest and for those who have been hurt by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal move to panic after a deeper military beach
Sunsetists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force launched an incredible storm
The air combat forces indicated that it was on a training flight but needed that no safety risk was presented
This was the moment when the weary tourists began to settle in panic after a deep-fashioned jet jumped over a full beach.
Dramatic video captures showed how the military aircraft nearly reached the target of sunsets on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidayers start to worry about the noise of the décentries without first seeing what happens to them through the clouds.
The event took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment like it was so exciting that it would break."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surf and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flight
The Portuguese Air Force indicated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a train flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and had to fly so far that this was the only possibility to recognize them.
The speaker said that because of the bad views of the jet, the nearby surface fires were much more intense than usual, but the air force needed to know that safety was not at all threatened at any time.
Area fires have destroyed this summer part of the Portuguese fortress, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force indicated today that the pilot had to fly so far as to limit his view due to the circumstances - strong snow and fire.
The aircraft is on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat must be identified as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with care against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday about the first step towards the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans entered the duel about the Spanish Supercup against the FC Sevilla, which is three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must, in a strong measure, join the subfinalist and ruling European League champion, among other things, Neymar, who competes with Brazil for the Olympic Football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German conducts a gang survey into the bone, which explains the individual question at Barca at least in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter steps have been taking place in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision and has left Bravo in the League, but for this reason, Ter step in most other applications.
Before the first commitment game of the new time, there is doubt in the Spanish master about the fitness status of the man who was demoted on Saturday in a game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the trial case against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced.
Sevilla again has the 2rd floor after enlargement in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far been successful in this competition with eleven record winners.
Ma Long in a private league to table gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new starship Olympics.
The 27-year-old met on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unique finale of his countryman and "titler" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4).
So the world ranking list first held the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have created it as expected in the final game and have made the title together.
Thus, it was clear that for the third time in consequence a Chinese would receive the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on top of the Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the seats and time-outs they had no coaches.
They had retreated to the tribunes and left their guards alone in the fair fight.
"The matches I've played for my country so far."
"In the final I play for myself," Zhang said accordingly.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners won with the Chinese fans.
The match itself was unexpected.
Mother had to fight with her 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the time on the plate and left Zhang from there only 13 points in total.
With Ma's advantage, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not able to see enough atmospheric waves.
Mizutan won the game of bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samson 4:1.
In his fourth final against German European Prime Minister Dimitrij Ovcharov, the white Russian had suffered a seizure, then in medical treatment, he had to "last" meet with Blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jørgen Persson (42/2008) became the same as high-level Olympics.
Donald Trump has a strong problem in the election fight.
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is subject to massive concerns, even in the traditional conservative states of the United States.
The presidential candidate Donald Trump was now weak in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment, in which the typical large-scale and self-secured multimillionaires appeared as anxious as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubts now grow in his success in the fight against the white house.
"We have serious problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who sought support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If there were false reports of his candidate, he took up his famous media shell again.
Observance of the Republican Hachburg
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A survey by SurveyUSA followed in June by Trump and his competitor, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see Trump before, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
As a threat, Arizona and Georgia also apply.
In an interview by CNBC's sender, Trump answered the question, how he wanted to stop the front March Clintons again: "Geneasso, as I have done so far."
And then create: "It will either be successful or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation".
He doesn't do anything else than tell the truth.
If it did not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, Trump further said.
Then I'll go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened to raise money to support its election fight, and it should not be able to present any better infraggerated.
Instead, we want to take more of the Republicans' candidates for the Congress into the hands of the poor.
Olympia: Drester Bug at Doping Test
The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary committee.
Kenya's Leittals are driven by the second doping sacrifices at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemeach.
After a sleep test at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and current Coach John Anzrah had given an Urin sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This was the Kenya team leader reported by the Doping Controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has asked IOC for information on the case to intensify its own research, shared with an IAAF speaker.
" Depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and published himself as Ferguson Rotich, presented the sample and signed," Kenyas Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in charge of accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was born in 2015 in Beijing WM-Fourter over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leichtateltech delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio games.
He will have to inform the sportsmen of his country of the upcoming Doping Tests.
Following media reports, he should be arrested at Nairobi airport on his return.
Kenya has been under special note for a long time after numerous doping operations in IOC.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Doping target controls by IOC before Rio games, it was unusual to suggest that special athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken to visit.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
As a result, the WADA Kenya was taken from the list of countries whose doping struggle is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is a big runner nation.
The country's lighthouses won most of the medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports of the ARD, it was repeatedly argued that Kenya Doping media are easily accessible and that there should be a significant mentality of the sport industry.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar study in Kenya, as he had done in the Russian Light Telephony.
It was possible to prove that this sport was both superficially and systematically baptized.
Russia's lighthouses were excluded from summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburger Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover, like Romeo and Julia.
With this, an amazing Cecilia Bartoli.
A musician named Salzburg: "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the music into the temple of the classic and filled himself with the role of Mary.
In the Orchestra tomb the Simón Bolívar Orchester led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he laments.
We always say that they are very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their time and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this insinuation Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with affection her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says in her song "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very pleasant.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecelia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's an unsuspecting great man.
And Bartoli repeats the compliment: "Dumel is such an extraordinary artist and very pleasant!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his views, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperature, a fire, a tolerance and also a happy way of life, which is absolutely very important!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly modern: "In this piece it is about advantages and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, the Puerto Ricans have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
There are the same topics, and they are as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who agreed to the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who have left London last year to join the IS, died reports following the death of reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family was experiencing some weeks after her death in Raqqwa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqwa, the ball work of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family's statement to leave the country of war and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as food and warning others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to stop people from making this decision at any time," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London climbed into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a white woman within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a vote at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will be nominated by Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell is the opinion that the next president will be dismissed by the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a telephone conference on Thursday that he expected him to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't take care of a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocked the nomination of the Garlands, being Lakes and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the president.
Treats wants a Christmas calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works together with photographer David Bellemera to produce a 1970's inspired Pirelli calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museums Calendar for 2017.
The chief editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his master magazine of Old School-Playboys was different since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do it for women.
Apparently he's the view that the calendar does it too.
"We have to go back to show timeless and classicality, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can enter their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculated by mass flight
"He who does not adapts and praises Erdogan sits on packed boxes," says the President of the Gülen-near Foundation of Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany has recently counted tens of thousands of asylum seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
It could even be "a few hundred thousand" in the medium term, according to Alliance President Ali Toprak.
Because of the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Putsch trial, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, on average with some hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Alliance President Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Since the government had already passed over the Kurdish Highburg with sanctions months ago, there were 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the flight.
After the devastated Portuguese, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that picks up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Federal Chief accused the intended possession of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevican cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been excavated or sold over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Federal Government "as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany a "hexenjagd" also takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German Biweig of the Golden Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will be looking for Asyl in Germany, especially Kurds and Opposite.
The branding of fire as a bringer of coal destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapts and praises Erdogan sits on packed boxes, the rest of the Chemistryists and the Sekularen," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports, Turkey has already introduced the largest group of asylum rights recognized by political persecution in Germany before the Portuguese.
By Friday, June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all people were entitled to asylum (39,625).
In this respect, those who are not in danger of war, poverty or prospectlessness are not affected.
Assiduous under the basic law are only political, so on the other hand, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it moves"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals are not allowed to choose the day of the summer election with - and vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer, the heavy Parliament has already decided on the beginning of the year.
Because blood is not going away for a long time: summer holidays, heats and landslides - that's what happens.
The locals who should be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most vacationers who are on their way to the country are not native, so they cannot choose the day of land.
Practical problems are coming up: In the holiday, help is to hang the posters, blow air balloons, distribute flies and select the final voice, just to get up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go through the people almost once again.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, just started.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selering, head of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It will be exciting how strong Newling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition shop.
Selering, 66 years old and since 2008, the head of government, makes a almost random election fight, looks out of his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and pulsates a little with the people, just as it has done his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Selering has got cold feet and gives Kanzlerin Merkel the debt on the flowering of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, "We're creating this" has speeded up the rise of lawmakers, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when it is at the right place at the wrong time.
She has invited her two Chancellor Angela Merkel to a large college; Merkel is a German election district in the north.
But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there as Mecklenburgers and Vorpommers.
"There was probably a majority of other German countries," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also hurt no one from other ethnic groups in Germany to listen once Angela Merkel.
On the other hand, the Nordost-CDU is widely opposed to the usual choice-making conditions on market sites and before shopping centers with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, I mean, is just another "subordinated role."
The Union has also noted that it has broken down the base on the country that it has to work very hard to find a way back to the people.
It's like the left, the SPD, the green: there's hardly any way around the country.
However, the CDU election fighter's council is also self-defensed: "They have to go where it goes, that is, where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called its SPD into a particularly engaged election fight.
The social democracies last questioned with 22% behind partners CDU (25) and only shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD was still clear with 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, should create the leap in the day of the earthquake.
They make from the holiday note a modern tugen and place their selection struggle mostly on the Internet.
"Online election campaign," it is called the country's president Claudia Müller.
In other words, green electoral contestants are sought by local voting citizens under the licensee.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just swimming with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Seas, and it's still beautiful.
Your impression: "Wahring leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-scanning: Guests are suffering from stress
At the speed with which B27 is channeled there is nothing to mix.
For the construction workers who start at 5.30 a.m. and finish at 20 a.m., there is a lot of praise.
"They've done everything pretty well," says Elvira Tetzluff from the jet dance station.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the building was able to move planically to the south until the end of October.
The meeting of the building workers will also be approved as regards the establishment of aid schemes.
Since the construction site was moved south on Monday and also the suspension of the Aspergstraße was lifted in Offerdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic gap has slowed down within the place.
The citizens can now proceed on both sides of the B 27.
It seems to be moving back through the place.
"There have been some significant complaints," said senior director-in-chief Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of sanitation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had more traffic learning because they were looking for many bad ways and were more confident of their ship than the description.
What led to some Lkw being frozen in residential areas.
Since the speed limits have not been met, the Community requested strengthening of the measuring vehicle from Mossingen.
"There have been significant overcrowdings," says King, who even made himself public about the situation.
There are two to three minutes left.
The fastest route was 77 hours in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction has continued, however, it has been quieter.
For business people at the B 27 there is only a small confidence that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look at the cards.
But that B 27 scans have led them to traffic jams, let everyone ask you through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end-clients", so they produce for other companies, for which sanitation has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" in the Meier car house, but also points out that of course "the running science is missing".
The locals along the street are most significant.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formed Krone, finds some significant words.
This is already dangerous.
Not just him, but all the guest homes have been "hard".
There were missing customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro trade.
The sales revenue is "more than 50 per cent".
The road repair has "repealed for two years".
Half of his employees must have left him.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
On the contrary, President Jørg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial balance, with the indication that guests benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now they must also bear the benefits of sanitation.
Gühner knows of other landscapes where something so grander has been held.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guesthouse will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to long history.
The fact that the rest of the family guests are now less often overlooked because of the complex transport operation can be understood.
If you can't drive, it's also beautiful.
The fact that his family client returns to the end of the healing work has no doubt about it.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of B27 construction work on his knowledge of the greatest crisis that his guests have experienced in their long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
It is regularly written in the name of the fight against terrorism in the name of legislation.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now offering a thick security package.
But what has a state of destruction to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of them?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner.
All its proposals are "politically misleading" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in his new security package.
They don't demand anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in it.
However, as a Minister of the Interior, he was placed on results and on a "intelligent consensus" within the coalition.
Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed some time to pass before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they now appear to be more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, called: That a new security authority should take care of key communications is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU proposals on aviation data and the law of arms.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière started a second race for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD until now: he wanted to impose sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and to defeat Dschihadists with double citizenship the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man.
Despite this, he held it imputable and demanded nothing from the coalition partner without any chance.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have partially included: He plans quick procedures for discharges and more possibilities for arresting people before decommissioning.
Refugees who are detained in the country should first check their smartphones and open social media accounts for security checks.
In the case of claims for retired asylum-seekers, he wants to make some even worse than long - such as committing the offences or withdrawing their papers in order to distort their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally neutral.
Some even seem unexplained and can open questions.
And in some points, for example, in the treatment of sufferers, the question is: What does it really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said in Abrede that the guardians of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high refugee numbers.
And the things that people were deeply occupied are not even now allowed to go out in election times.
Internal security is very focused.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is large.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
First of all, there is a sharp dispute about the provision of federal police, then about a political collection of security ideas by some EU Interior Minister, in which the Heads of State also demand a Burka ban and a withdrawal from the dual citizenship.
The Maizière must also be here for degrading tone.
From a turn off the double pass, he didn't hold anything.
We have welcomed the debate in Germany.
Don't make any sense if you're gonna wake up again.
And at a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally binding on all actors and whether it is actually "unmovable" for the coalition partner, it must be shown first.
There's something in it that could make a difference.
However, the SPD is now also trying to profile its internal security issue.
Participating Sigmar Gabriel signals first carefully and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further security."
People's cars are still moving smoothly.
Despite Diesel Canals, delivery rates are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets run around.
There's a word on the back.
People's cars start in the second half of the year of delivery.
Although Europe’s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the course of the past year thanks to its many brands and some of its well-being markets.
In July, however, the VW core brand failed in particular in Western Europe and again charged the total sale as reported by the company mentioned in the Dax.
The brand VW sold worldwide in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year's month.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 per cent below the previous year's average.
In the German domestic market, the delivery was almost a six-six.
The trader Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers back from July, particularly on two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic framework conditions" have resulted in a resale of sales.
In addition to the situation around the polling test in Turkey, the British vote on the EU's export had also been imposed, a speaker explained.
In the U.S., where the wastes were first scaled, there is also a minus to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main domestic market in the Netherlands is still glamorous by the diesel canal: after the first seven months, only a reduction in delivery of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is due to be booked.
The company sales manager Fred Kappler was able to provide further sales services from January to July.
1.3 per cent more vehicles have now produced a population of 5,904 million worldwide.
People's cars were manipulating with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for refurbishment in the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment VW confirmed that the construction of the car has no negative effects.
After the vehicle is refurbished there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer presents the customers with a "guarantee" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was in business circles on Friday.
The reason is the legal characteristics.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen provided its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This had been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives from the Federal Ministry of Transport.
This meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW has to complete the tasks of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Diversions are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all relevant vehicle type-approval values have unchanged.
People's cars themselves use the term "guarantee" but not as it did in business circles.
In the broad term "guarantee" Volkswagens see the possibility, for example, that customers will come into a workshop about half a year after their conversion – and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust canal to ensure that any insurance arrangements are as appropriate as they were.
Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegersee demands future punishments - as the second institution in Germany.
The bank chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily accounts".
The Federal Bank of Germany speaks of a single case and does not see any sign of it: Normal savings should "not be afraid to pay for their ransom punishment".
Stocking banks Money at night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0,4 per cent of their penalties.
This fee will require the Raiffeisenbank GmbH from September of private and business customers to return more than 100,000 euros to Giro or day-to-day accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He had been worth 40 million euros that could be lifted from one day to the other and that he could not appreciate.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," said the bank chief.
"I can't borrow for every million euros."
He now continues to pay the costs according to the cause principle.
The bar money simply lies in the treasurers of the Raiffeisen bank, which would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four cases, I don't want the fifth," said the bank president.
Most customers would have understood and changed on other platforms.
Only a few traveling to other banks.
The company association Bayern stated: "The excessive monetary policy rate of the ECB causes significant costs for all banks".
It is not possible to carry it alone.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for carrying out accounts, credit cards or transfers.
With fines for investments from three million euros, the Thuringer People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made a series of strikes with its Skatbank affiliate 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the Head of the Banking Bond, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay expeditiously for investments, which is too much competition in Germany under banks and savings".
A banker said, on the Tegersee, there's "a customer equipped with something better."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if she saved money free of charge.
The 1911-based Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has twinnings in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegersee.
In the region, known players, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Company Association Bayern "from now on no other banks are known to calculate an exposure rate for private customers' investments," said the speaker Ernst.
The President of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fühlich, had said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative against the private customer is very, very high".
The competition was hard, and it resulted in the downsizing of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to do so in general.
Destination plates: who actually buys shell plates?
Only men middle age love discs.
Before you change to the comment section to overcome it under the pseudonym NotAllOnly menMillerenAlders with bad attachments, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the many-speaking re-emergement of shell discs is not on a tree in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but return to Midlife Nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are all expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is not too hard for Hobby collectors - it has an emotional importance: older disc purchasers keep their feelings better for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I was walking through a busy street in Soho, wearing a certain gray approach and stuulating wild before I stand up, holding my hands and saying something specific like, "So let us look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly enters its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which only independent sellers were present - there is still a lot of fantastic plate shops before.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand right next to different men in such business and try to assess their age and mood by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, where I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably following the 20s, is a long day because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the hours.
Is he a collector, I'll ask him?
"I already know," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plate plates, illustrated above (he sent me the ambulance by e-mail, I didn't follow him to his home), the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owned such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and buy things he sold when he was young and he was crying.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I probably was too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more frustrated and willing to spend their time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my last.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are accessing the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old plates again.
From the talks I have conducted, people have usually begun their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the attachment of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that disc business offers a relaxed community of equal benefits.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took an interest in the contact-free payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to return to the stability of trusted plate holes, from objects that provoke happy youth memories.
"I think it can sometimes be filling an empty or possession of material owners as a sort of trust," Wez says.
That's what I do as a collector and I think it's true in many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We're like her social workers!" a staff member jumped out of a platform.
An ICM survey in April included that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard of it.
The survey also found that 41% of the CD players they never use, while 7% of those who buy a CD do not own a CD player.
By this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I'd be more concerned by a stack of Bossa Nova complications.
Jonny, 42, who worked at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), noticed a "Trophynasty" aspect of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have any record players, but I'd like to buy a radio head card so I can put it in regular," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have record players."
These are younger people, not older, who just get along slowly.
Fopp, who's devoted almost a whole floor to the plate, has a rather boring audience than I'm dancing.
There are couples about the 70, tourists, making the photos, teenagers and women middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned business - Wild Beasts is the newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drawing from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in customers.
None of them look uniquely alone, but walking mental traumas are difficult to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and takes into account the variety of plates for sale.
She's making a watch bomb more than a big deal.
It does not deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways and ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she runs off with a loved driver.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I gave the appearance to sample Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenagers who were grouping for a moment to polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter passed by to buy a Crosley plate player.
On the left is a wooden house, a wall full of tablets from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one sees them - maybe because they're just pure decorative, some are so far up that it's impossible to catch them.
It's pure plate art.
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send sohos deep for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than others are also those who spend most of their time and money on luxury items such as plates.
Even if my research has shown that the results of YouGov are in agreement, they will, at least in plate shops in Soho, overlook the large number of female collectors and plate lovers who exist in reality, plate shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or offices.
They spend their Thursday mornings with security not with the drumming by plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they are the starring look of an mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator who does not charge any innocent men of middle age over the shoulders.
The Greenlandhai is the longest live vibrating animal - Video report
Scientists say that Greenland has the longest life span of all wild animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, the Haie researcher, says that the record was at a woman's house, from which it will end, that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
The French Court of Justice dismissed the offer of a breakdown of business in the Dschungel refugee camp
A French court rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais to bring down thousands of temporary businesses and restaurants in the village of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to withdraw 72 provisional business in which persons within the warehouse, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to sell, offer refrigeration services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents) or simple meals for a couple of Euros in provisional restaurants.
The President Calais argued that these places should be reduced because they would represent a parallel economy that would not be taxed and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared with the court that business and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in the stock.
They also indicated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the distribution of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but held that the concerns of the predecessor of Calais "are absolutely uncompromising."
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food business, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than eating people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet contact points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the Dutch voyage was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum issues for hundreds of minors who are in need of protection.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to make the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the conclusion would "for these children would be a disaster of which the most recent eight years are."
The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in Dschungellar has increased to over 9,000 – the highest number up to now – after a steady increase in new households during the summer.
Despite Olympics: Martin remains a fighter
Despite his shocking event in the Olympic era, Rad Prof. Tony Martin does not want to get undercover.
"I keep the WM in view, remain reliable and fight further," wrote the 31st-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have a statement for his 12th place at the Sugar House.
"I really find it hard to comment on yesterday's time," Martin said.
He needs to analyze in peace what reasons he had for debacle.
At the time-WM in October in Qatar, Martin really wanted to fight the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the past."
"This is also my position," wrote the three-time world champion who lost 54.5 km on the Wednesday over three minutes on the Olympics Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis Prof. Siegemund misses half-final

Group rises at start-up for live video playback
Other people are interested in playing video games, a trip centre - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that specializes in this Hobby.
As much money for the acquisition runs out, Microsoft didn't share it on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others in the game, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give the players missions and deliver enemies as well as equipment items.
The playful activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the growing world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already on the rise.
The staff of the start-up, who has so far been in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., are going to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam-Mitfounder and Chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
For customers, therefore, the acquisition should not change anything.
Beam is integrated according to Microsoft into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming video games is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by Amazon online dealer in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Racer must set itself on the next generation speed measurement: in various German countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which should be particularly effective.
For example, the future-looking enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden company can be used for emergency points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationed monitor.
But a permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or dangerous.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days of uninterrupted measurement operation, which will transmit case data via a modem.
In addition, laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be taken over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as traffic prohibitions by time, driving routes and vehicle classes can also be monitored.
In high-speed mode you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily shaken, it is reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the panned and also the rest of the shelled outer layers.
In addition, an integrated alarm system should protect the viewer from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to data from Vitronics in various German countries and is also being used.
Foreign authorities are also familiar with the new technology: Young France has ordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain holds silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass holds gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby came at the end of Thursday night to a stop at the last hall in the form of Fiji when they were hit by a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handing, side-stepping, treading, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medals of any color.
The download was shattered by the not too bad trust price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The main download of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-finals, could fall back on them on the same day.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have killed a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a trust for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a tough way back.
Eight years ago they lost each game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
They'll lose only one here.
This sleep is getting wet, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs out of space.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. when you were on a train bus. The world series winners went up 5-0 when the ocean Coliniseu was raised in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned into.
12-0 and GB almost picked up the ball.
A magnificent tomb of Mitchell stopped reaching the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third tower, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua looked at a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-attack and there was still more than a minute of game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovovovu was hit by another weakling of the GB team and pushed up to the line to make a tower.
The conversion took a 29-0 to a break.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB was still learning.
That's right.
GB led fundamental changes to half-time and concluded the fiscal success...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant game between Fiji.
Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long enjoyed the benefits of the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, their fans were wet and danced on the tribune.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's game approach.
Mata Vilame put the i-dubpleken with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff broke down, the Fijis collapsed, and GB shot destructively in the races.
Earlier that day, Fiji Japan had won half-final with 20-5 and Britain forced South Africa into a narrow half-final match from the race - the conversion of Britain to the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and reached a tower below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later record by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15-Aside team, assured the winner - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired by a fight with the trainer's cancer on the spine
There will be no emotional gold than in these games and that's what they want.
From the first round strike to the last, 220 hard Hieves, who entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance at their golden moment at Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were sitting on the deck, there were three voices in the boat. The coach's echo Robin Williams was all-embracing when they ran into the second Olympic gold in the two without charge, the first women in the history of the British sport, who placed such a level.
Her domain was absolutely, always 39th of unskilled use, which is also exemplary.
What we see are two brilliant athletics that lead across the surface with the elegance of lightning, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to go.
After every gold in the mine, a battalion belongs to volunteers who contribute to the increasing progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer who didn't know if he would ever survive this day than cancer was diagnosed with him.
As he said, it was risky.
I had a blast cancer that's operational and they did it.
If you don't, he'll spread out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the look a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was treated early in 2014, outside the season, could start what kept the interruption to a minimum, if this is in fact the right concept under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go back soon.
It was an adventure.
I was in the hospital and I loved the station around here - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said there would be enough steps.
That's how it starts.
Rudern is already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.
In the immediate absence of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than anything else and tried to process his own anxiety.
Stanning, who was the chief man in the Royal Artillery regime in an application in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wrack this week. It may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It's just how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together as well as Robin.
It was three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks goes to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost their race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began, Stanning and Glover had a lot of reservations.
We were very arrested at the moment.
Helen called " staying in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want to fire today, we just wanted to achieve a good outcome, go out and win the race, what we're doing.
The couple will take time for a year before decisions are made about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding with her own TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic artist.
It was so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 Years Preordained for Enlightenment
Ruppert Göller, the director of the water supply chain "Vetenstein Group", is in the state of rest.
The link is defined as "bear-width pre-formal".
A small French water supply link as an example for large water producers.
This was done in the originalton some time ago in a contribution from the Bavarian Round Führer.
Not later, the Water Forum of the Government of Sub-Frands appreciated the purpose of the link.
The work of the Vetenstein Group is considered to be "beaernwide as exemplary".
After all, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the trade union, is 28 years of age.
Now at the age of 65 he was granted a leave of absence.
The drinking water chain of the Veitenstein Group is located in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, provides water every year about 150000 cubic metres and provides 32 locations and wells with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the communities of Kirchluter, Breitbrunn, Louter, Ebelsbach and the city of Bauanach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and communities.
The current president, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and has already been appointed manager of the Task Force since 1988.
"Its tasks have been very varied and they have been extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions until the end of the week," said the President.
As outstanding events, it called for the introduction and deployment of new sources (1994), the sale of raw materials in the area of new sources (1998) and the destruction of agricultural products, the treatment of high-level containers (1999), the reopening of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
It has not given any rest and you've always had innovations, because water life is important and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Loudatio she praised Güllers for over 31 years of faithful, reliable, and right service.
He used a lot of blood for his water supply and he lived the water supply regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he could present the success concept of the Whitestone Group on Nitration before the Water Forum in the area.
He's got a lot of recognition and praise for it.
Rupert Göller, on the other hand, praised the Water Wart Alfonso Gribel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water waiter and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an impasse team.
As high points from his point of view, he referred to the construction and restructuring of the purpose bond.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the rohrbrück at the top of the warehouse at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at less than 17 degrees, we had to work all night so that the villages could be provided with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was also possible only once because it filled the top of Pettstadt with holes.
The management of the drinking water chain was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who was responsible for the consequences of Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko is open with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other parents concerned: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was diagnosed with her son, she believed that she had to die.
But the eight-year-old Tiago was well advanced and now learns privately in New York where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that lasts for two years when I sing at the Milan scale, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Barghteheitie - Man Shoots at Life Hazard
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multifamily house in Bergteide (Kreis Stormrn) and killed her.
"The man himself called us and told us to shoot his life-threatening man," said a police spokesman.
The father was on the run, after him will be publicly arrested.
In the meantime, the federal area, because Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscleless, burning and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police published a photo of him.
However, it's a few years old.
In the middle, the man wears a glass.
The man is not to be spoken directly.
He could still bring the guns to himself, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police speak of a state of affairs.
The victim was in 1988, the father in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any information about fatherhood or the relationship between father and victim; however, they confirmed that a person was killed.
"It's a murder case."
"We don't say anymore now," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
Eyewitnesses followed a special service command (SEK) on the tatort.
Steel - Light view for the German steel industry
The energy-intensive German steel industry remains at an additional cost in millions.
Financial charges incurred by the industry from the ecosystem supply are from the table.
It remained at the time of the release of the renewable energy plant at the stock production plant for so-called own power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, Free Emission).
"I am really glad that after two years we were finally able to achieve this negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to request the steel producers to use the gas from the Head of State for electricity production for their own consumption.
The steel industry incurred additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year according to the German industry.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when generators are replaced in steel works will a 20 per cent EEC deposition occur.
But neither will this be raised in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity production.
This will make the status quo of the above-mentioned regime widely fixed.
The success of Gabriel in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is the future' this is a first step."
"We have to follow further."
"In the reform of Emission Law, climate and employment objectives are also considered," IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity since the 2008 financial crisis and a significant price pressure.
In the past year, the situation continued to worsen when China’s largest producer country, despite the growing domestic demand, was heavily stocked on the world market.
European producers offer Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation was somewhat tense.
In order to show bound import duties on imports of steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have emerged.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German branch primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, the prices would have been resuscitated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thesisenkrup also did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel manufacturers remained cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tonnes of less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Economic Union of Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantities produced now returned in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production is about two percent below the previous year's value.
The link is calculated in the coming months by an improved order layer with an increase in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does adults good
The song has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl, she was in school, in the school studio she was busy with the art of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an adult choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorsliga.
Most seniors sing in choir and share the joy of music with equal families, says Hackler.
Through regular co-operation, seniors can bond and provide social contacts.
Because often social and family structures grow up in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "I agree and organize myself to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Singing can be an effort in a positive sense, I mean, hacker.
Because adults train a deep and controlled mood.
Those who regularly demand their tongue don't get out of the desert as soon as possible.
Even if it's about to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
In older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher role value, which was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explained.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people brings many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Thanks to lyrics and especially melody, demented people feel themselves on long-lasting events.
At singing the head is also given a special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and a given rhythm and adapt to the other songs - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Only older people who live alone do so not just concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A popular audience is a great lobby.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I take a long time to practice something, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience will strengthen.
Well, there's good reason to start with the song, so there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have a little talent, save Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's already there when one sound goes up there?
In the search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the known circle is in a senior school, you can just follow up.
Many cities also offer views of the choir in the environment.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church president.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
Whoever has fun to sing should join a choir without a condition, says Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something to release - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats to the cry of young animals
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of the call of Katzenbaby on adult animals.
To her surprise, the boys did not let the men call them - but they always felt the same as the women.
Female cats can recognize the degree of erection of Katzenbabys in the young.
They respond about 10 percent faster to the voice of Kätzchen, who are in great need of what scientists have found from Hannover University and Medical University (MHH).
Although Kate also reacts to the call of Kätzchen - but always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between males of less and more experienced young animals for men are either not true or of no importance," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the founder of the study published this Friday in the professional magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the length and height of the Kätzchen cry is different from the urgency of their need for help.
In total, nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the holding of the MHH.
They were assigned to a call from small ones who were taken from the Worfbox for three minutes and separated from mothers and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with shouts of stronger-strengthened cats which were further raised.
The researchers maintain their results despite the little attempt to overcome them.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own upbringing, reacted differently to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call from the very literate castles was played.
This ability may have been born or developed by sex.
"It was a surprise that men have responded at all," said the biologists.
In the past, scientists have researched the reactions of women and men to baby voices several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to girls, even if they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski handles "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sikur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey a port order has been issued against the only football star Hakan Sikur.
He will be called upon to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the poll test, there is another important football game in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrival between the viewtas Istanbul and Lucas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul about the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.
In July, when the derogation was granted after the restructuring test, the government was concerned that normal citizens should not be affected every day.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, which is responsible for the pontch test.
This is not done before the football.
In response to the former Starkicker Hakan Sikur, the state administration issued a court order.
It is therefore proposed to be a member of a terrorist group in Central America.
Sikur is to be an ally of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is appointed by the President of the state Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the post-test.
Although the exceptional situation for the first 90 days still applies until October, in fact, it has as good as no effects on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "Democratic Watch" on public places throughout the country has explained Erdogan on Wednesday for the end.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into allies and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the work club view are not traditionally considered to be the friends of the president.
What makes Turkey's greatest, however, in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military forces.
There are even the fans - no matter whether your heart is hit by Galatasaray or views.
In the case of pocalsier "Gala", it will be especially welcome to Lukas Podolski.
His sports value was shown by the Colner in the course of the season: with 17 towers and nine proposals in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first time as topscore of his association.
At the end of the game against Fenerbahce he achieved the 1:0 victory match.
The newspaper "Fanatic" quoted him as saying, "He was the best in the place."
He has finished the season in an excellent way and has assured his crew the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the amazing season for the record teacher found a shameful conclusion.
After the round K.o in the Champions League, the "Low" also emerged early in the European League.
In the super light it's only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The poker was the only chance to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Views, he loved the game year better.
In particular, Mario Gomez, who was founded on Title 14.
That is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31st year.
In doing so, the AC Florenz had been under contract and had only been notified to Gomez who had been hired after the pontch test, because of the political situation in the country after his EM leave.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club chief Fikret Orman.
However, the conductor had to be prepared to sell around a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay for his attitude at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have Medal Chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already arrested twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistblelower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other overhauled light-tattles can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio about medals.
The theme Doping is as determined by the battle lines of the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian skimmer Julia Jefimowa, who had recently complained about her right to start the game after a doping-sperre, was excavated and excavated at her start (100 metres breast).
There's a dark scene: With a raised smile, she was still proud of the hall and she had acted out of her presence.
As soon as she realized she wasn't gonna get gold, the audience came out in a jubilee storm.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite Doping's past in the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light-tattle technology.
He was already arrested twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006 until 2010).
Since its ban, the 2004 Olympics and Ex-World Masters are running even faster than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staff/Jamaika): The two Olympic and seven-fold World Masters had to abstain from six-month spree in 2010 after they were shown to have taken the painkiller Oxycodon.
After an operation she had severe tooth pain, she was protected by the 29-year-olds.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): The 2012 Olympics, World Championships 2013 and European Masters from 2010 to 2016 were tested positive for the banned Mothylhexamine-based stimulants.
Perkovic is fighting the significant takeover and has been shut down for six months.
The four largest bidders this year go to the account of the great gold preference.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staff/USA): The Beijing Olympic and Two World Masters over 400 m were tested positive in 2010 and stopped for 21 months.
A means of penicillating has been responsible for merritt.
In this year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 meters of the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwarf, White Russia): Almost one athlete was known as so many medals at night.
Thus Tichon lost his WM title in 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with Testosterone Doping.
The mid-40s also had to be awarded the 2004 Olympic Silver for steroid Dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosterone misuse.
The also known bronze medals of the 2008 Olympic Games were received back on the basis of a judgement of the International Sports Court of Justice CAS.
With 80.04 m, it is located on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km away, China): The world recordr and goldfavority were tested in May, but can still start in Rio.
At the age of 29, World Masters were advised to take a banned food supplement, which was released on July 13th by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA.
Bomber terror in Thailand - Austria damaged - More deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand is with the woman in contact, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
You have had cut wounds and have been treated in the hospital, but you can already leave it again.
Her home trip has been planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities as soon as possible.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok’s capital, was first bombed on the Thursday evening in an outlet.
According to the police, one Thai country was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two bombs came up again, and according to the authorities, another man was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
At the detonation near the Badestrand Patong, which was popular in holiday resorts, a taxi driver was injured after police entry.
In Surat Thani on the south coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed a city employee.
According to the authorities in a flower beet before the coastal police revier.
Finally, several damages were required in Phang Nga and Trang on the south coast as well as in Chumphon on the south coast.
You're leaving a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, you said.
"The bombers carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmetavee on Friday morning before journalists.
"We are leaving that it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to eliminate any possible motives - but it is probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
However, the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic opposition or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
There is a lot more to be said that the bombs were placed on the enemy of the ruling military junta.
In the past days the authorities had received confidential information on previous attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.
The police showed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment facilities.
There are still smaller bombing attacks in Thailand, but they are not mostly directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by King Bhumobol Adulyadej of Thailand.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be provided without conditions.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
According to austerity between security forces and Muslim population groups, there are no necessary travel to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a draft of the military junta.
This also has a major impact on the military in the coming years.
The chief of Junta and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to hit Chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving the economy and tourism.
The military turnout, which had gained power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is itself to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to get into the grip of Muslim rebellions in the south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people were already killed in the conflict.
A year ago, 20 people were also killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack on the country's younger history.
The right "Identitarian Movement" is awarded to a visitor of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
After several national officials, the constitutional defenders also took note of the group.
"We see positive points in the 'Identative Movement' for efforts against the free democratic framework," said President Hans-Georg Maasten of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
This is how the growing Islamic faith or from the Middle East is spread extremisticly.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It refers to "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "lost identity by transfer".
Constitutional protection in nine German countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Thuringen - have already observed "identifications".
Mr Maesten said that his authority had closely agreed with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identificate movement' are trying to get their target group out of where they are," said the Chief of Constitutional Protection.
Extremeists generally try to contact them with young people’s language, often with poppy music.
Islamists do this as well as legal separatists.
That's not a serious advertising for your own business.
The propaganda is to appeal to people’s emotional needs.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Finally, reports from several German countries about contacts of "identifiers" with AfD politicians were made.
Maesten said he didn't have any knowledge of that.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It comes to whether the parties concerned - in this case, the AfD - are certain persons who are extremists, change their direction and become extremist.
It is therefore exceptional whether such persons have influence over the party.
This has not been identifiable.
In view of the significant increase in legal penalties and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he would not yet speak of new legal terrorism in this regard.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal stereotypes.
There was the Old School Society group or the Freelance Group.
It may be obvious that other legal terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks from other legal extremists.
However, a German or European control of legal terrorism is not identifiable.
So far, the groups have been established at regional level or in social networks.
Concerned were expressed that many people who had not previously appeared in the right scene had gone to the account.
This is the concern.
Many of the suspects of assaults on asylum are not previously known as criminal, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed punishments which had nothing in common with legal separatists who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links, which have then radicalized themselves by legal extremism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros will be online
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the battle lines in the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight Swimming Swimming from Ethiopia is so slow that it was temporarily no longer seen in TV images.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected.
In social networks, there were also viral Internet hits.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends with a delay of 48 seconds and weighs the 59th place of 59 beginners.
However, it was not just a sports figure that drew attention to international media.
Why does 24-year-olds still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make known Swimming in the countries represented.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros haste is ready for the big race.
Quick, the first top names made the rounds.
Some media called him "robel of the Wall".
In response to a "Wowstand" building, the English Boulevardblatt "The Sun" made it fun with "Dad Bod".
His time, he won only one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, didn't play a role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Mossambani took care of media attention.
The sight of the Swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to stand alone in a race of more than 100 metres.
Frenetically, Mossambani was burned.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the battle.

An open industrial lift in DTLA gets a comfortable makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the central library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been ordered.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsreider had left her business on Monday at 7:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window in the ground.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., they lost some 250 euros from the case.
Tracks of the father could not be found.
Also a video surveillance is not available.
Trump does not see the current selection
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at a election in Florida.
Should it not be with the US presidential election, Donald Trump has already had an alternative.
Then he's on his way to the holiday.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential election in November, it would be relatively unusual for him to say, "It's either gonna hit it or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV CNBC.
If it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
He thus named US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic state (IS).
In his party, there was a growing opposition.
Posts increase in trade with electro transporters
An electric vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the hazard is clearly large.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the group wants to start trade with the carrier.
The post will also offer its electric transporter from the coming year on the free car market.
"We want to enter the third party sale," said a post-computer on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it should sell its own developed StreetScooter with the letter and packages to other companies.
The Post-President Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always questions about handworkers.
According to the newsmagazine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of vehicles.
In the post-production industry, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that for a long time, a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles would be possible.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we're going back to the complete fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active since 2014 in Germany's streets.
GfK management comes from surprising business numbers
The consumer research company GfK shares its head, Matthias Hartmann.
The return visits came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has made it clear that the chair of President Matthias Hartmann will become so insecure as to remain the success he has promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberger Market Research Company GfK: After resuscitating business numbers and the return of business management, the world number five of the industry is before a personal start.
GfK Chief of Staff wants to leave the company for the past year.
The President of the GfK Board of Supervisors Arno Mahlett is already leaving the Board of Supervisors with effect on 12 September.
The Board's management was already taking over by 1 September the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, who shared with the company.
He shall officially assume the role of a "presiding speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a basis for the withdrawal, the company referred to the long-term business policy focus "in various views".
Details did not want to call a business speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research undertaking in the future are still unclear.
In business circles, it was the last day that the shareholders were disappointed about the continued success of the restructuring undertaken years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK Spice since 2011.
"The results of restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," he said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business numbers, each participant will be disappointed at some time.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quantz would do the same," he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the previous quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, the turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the corresponding previous quarter.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales of EUR 721.2 million fell by 3.4 per cent.
In the second quarter, the profit was mainly due to the low value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company’s claims of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the area of consumer experience, protected the Group’s losses of EUR 148.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had gained another share of 19.7 million.
In case of accidents - Bus comes in cramps in graves: Eight injured
In the case of a bus accident with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhurn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the nurses suffered serious injuries, and the police shared them.
The 66-year-old driver of a railway undertaking from Eisenach, according to his data, had to remove a missing cargo that was partly on the road.
The bus came right from the street and jumped into a grave, as a speaker of the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Because of the position of the bus the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire weapon released the insassins.
Six rescue vehicles and a notary vehicle came to an inconsistency on the country street 2.
The undamaged passengers were brought back by a line bus to Pewsum city centre.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of wastewater shall be EUR 3.44 instead of EUR 2.10, EUR 3.36 (EUR 2.26) and EUR 3.64 (EUR 2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater tax will be increased at least once again if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overcalculation, the discount price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landrasamt Kulmbach, it was established that coverings for these wastewater facilities are to be completed.
The Kasendorf market has been obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively on the basis of legal grounds.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as business and industrial operations from Wellschenkhal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to be deeply involved in the money exchange.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Gremium, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-relationships were also to be offset from the previous calculation period.
The serious tax increases were based on Schmidt, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year for all three small water plants with relatively small installations with very low rainfall.
This would seriously affect, for example, applications for necessary repairs from several thousand euros due to the low distribution base.
In addition, the drop-down rate in all three plants is easily reverseable.
Furthermore, in all three installations during the subsequent calculation period, they have not recently been affected by their age of sanitation and repair applications in a significant extent.
The facility in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkhal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in Azendorf the mechanical combustion plant had to be replaced because of a damage.
At the Wellschenkhal pump, nearly 20 years old promotional facilities had to be completed on a basis and, at the start of the drawing facility, Lopp had to be built up after almost 20 years of operation of the first lighting system, to provide clarity and to build an additional capacity for use in order to meet the water law standards in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary applications, the costs of maintenance and maintenance have been recorded to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stonehousers pointed out that in the case of the low wastewaterfall in the three plants, the use for the operation and maintenance was "completely exceeded".
In addition, Schmidt added that the market community has remained behind from large maintenance costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these installations will continue to be cautious in view of stone houses on a permanent basis, as long as it is not possible to extend the supply area of the waste water supply zone to these facilities because it is afforestation facility.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria is based on a monthly basis in July 1%.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October, as positive 0.2% have been denied.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed for the following groups of consumers: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); Transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remain as in the premonate for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million users per day to change the reality and play with identities in such a way as to limit to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Liechtenstein.
The filters are unmovable, property transfer tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All of the mistakes have been made to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, where they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or white skin as a beauty display.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them castles, false teeth and twisted walls, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Award face".
They wondered whether these repeated disputes would indicate a greater problem that the company has diversity.
News and import were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat reported that it had disabled the feature.
The company makes an apology: the filter was thought to be a homoge of anime characters and not as a caricature of Asia.
But outsiders who have experienced racism remind the filter of harmful clicks.
Others allowed the comparison of anime to decide.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely circulated, wrote that the filter "was very, very uncomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very negative Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow-eyed face has been drawn into the opposite extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes this cultural column transfer.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats, a large audience of young people - who are different in race than their older opponents - could go beyond waiting for sensitivity.
If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is misleading for a user, "so it is much harder to keep such things out of notice than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and a medium engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In a statement for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related conflicts reflected a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticised the white, only male leadership, and ended their installation with a hashday: #DelateSnapchat.
"Or they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their community so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left mostly unresponsive.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its population and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to one speaker, the company recently established a staff member who focused on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said that her snapshot account will be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not O.K."
Military conduct False ISIS Secret Service Information, Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command have changed the news service information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions in place, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Anti-Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction under the Central Command Secret Servicelists who reported how their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state have changed.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting services information which were typically rejected by senior Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual state of the place and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the centcom are as high as the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi combat forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government spies under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen the pressure of their predecessors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than they were in line with the facts," said the report.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military withdrawal of Mossul could already start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear." Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the news service reports in order to play the risk through ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called on the Task Force to live after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be filled out by more detailed findings while the findings are being continued.
In addition, further findings of the Centcom reports are being made by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an extremely limited process for the creation of ITIL and Iraqi security services," said the High Commissioner for Democracy, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Shipf, "has delayed the publication of news reports", damaged moral among analysts and "gives too little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Shipf and the Democrats pointed out that they had not found any indication of a white house's entry into the Centcom analysts in relation to a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress's findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, New York Times reported reports of investigations by the General Inspector General of the Pentagon, who were recorded following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Mr Patrick Evans, a press speaker from the Pentagon, expressed the view that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the General Inspector's findings were still under way.
But he also noted that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that media services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The findings have had an impact on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made between a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the allegations last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for fair assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Critics about the secret information about the Islamic state recall weaknesses over ten years ago, as a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter on how the government at the time, under George W. Bush, opposed the recommendations of many analysts, predicted only a small drop in employment in Iraq and little time to deal with the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rise of the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to government statements of air raids against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there had no significant impact on the financing of the terrorist group since these provisional refineries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms of the former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the battle in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States won fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain before
One day after she shot three towers during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two towers for the American Feldhockkey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember what they had done at any time.
"I don't know." She said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.
However, they know this: Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Games and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round.
Both teams have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will be decided which of the two members of their six teams will each reach the first and second place.
The first place will take the strong Dutch people a little longer away from the road leading the other groups.
Just as the game can always go out on Saturday, Americans have solved a surprising puzzle through their success history, four years after they landed in the last 12 places in London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands (the two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), and at the age of 16, she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She lost the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything happened for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, began making the best use of things.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the pension in London that we now have.
We've been able to get the miner back completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the tournament in the first half of the game with a back-hand shot from the neighborhood.
If he had not won the tournament without winning the game, the team seemed surprised and held the game from 1 to 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then went into the middle and jumped the ball into the tower to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez built the final tower in the middle of the last quarter.
The shot was the first of the entire tournament for the American tournament, Jackie Briggs, which until then had to rent a tower in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the range of the Olympics, the core of the trampoline
Wherever you are as late as it is, there are the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and irreplaceable, a racing stage between competition and competition.
It's like the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stick, which is brought from the armrest protection to the spinner to the triathlet.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first time in the Olympic Games and is a woman's warm with hugs, could have been directly among these well-known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and welfare TV advertising if he was a Swimmer, Turner or even fatter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline tournaments about gold.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the types of sports that are not generally recognized: air gunfires, firefights, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the chest Shim and we can dominate it for a long time.
But if I have to make certain arguments for my particular love, then let me link my attention to the discrepancy charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so excitingly realized in the last 16 years that many of those I asked did not know that it is a particular Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to the game, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumps and has had an athlete until 2012 that has created it to the end.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men and Chinese and Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained watch for a clown school than for the Olympic games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a committed enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential - the cardoon-holding tanks of its willful rise - but also the gratitude of the tournament and the shower, the two types of sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "scan board."
Scattering conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to have a series of falling movements (dried, heavy and salts) before they land on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic programme after execution, the degree of difficulty and "flight time".
Two-way athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are being interviewed in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is just outside.
Medal holders must go forward, faster, higher and higher in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to go back and forth, to the top and bottom of the game.
They seek not only the destination or the way out but also another high target in television broadcasting: the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, amazing, even fantastic - and it is enough to drive a viewer to trains.
But it's also what I felt when I watched these games as something encouraging.
From this the trampoline offers a break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she turns off, looks like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then unmistakably up.
There is also a competition here, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no ethical attack on the target, no wood into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant interruption of time and energy.
It's as sound as competition in the Olympic games can only be.
The qualifications and surroundings of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, as well as at 13.00.
NBC will be released as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Manie they promise a quiet, quiet moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the acquisition and objectiveization of male athletes - as the US tourr says The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley is waiting for his flight to air, new prison.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an American connector
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Democrats who demand political changes in Ethiopia are firmly opposed by the government.
Witnesses said that protesters were killed during the meeting with the police during the shooting.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid westerner with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months, protests against the government have spread to more and more areas.
In the last week, thousands of people flocked to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unmerited.
Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.
In the course of the video about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people beat up with pieces while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The Head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has been increasingly difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist attacks outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so many Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable time.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendler train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was all other than an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued to pressure the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents have been effectively brought to the ground.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or transported to the lengths of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they don't have any other options to protest, it starts," said Seyoum Teshome, a doctor in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints which cover all of the use of land to the invasion of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last sitting of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts feared that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who had been more or less forced in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and rearmed.
A number of factors explain why feelings of prayer are now exploding over the surface after years of fasting.
The first seems unharmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have there been a large number of Ethiopians able to communicate through social media, since cheap smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government restricts access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially when protestors do, many people can still communicate via Internet processes that hide where they stand.
Several young Ethiopians suggested that they were gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eonen, the Amaras, who come from Ethiopia from predominantly Christian highlands, have thrived in politics and economics while enjoying the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We are about to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia will be dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigriray, which is approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was a 17-year-old Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death at an unpubliced disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of echoes.
Analysts say that he was particularly influenced by the fact that early signs of dissatisfaction were observed and that he used special tasks to treat opposers and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic message," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analytic.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected for relatively blind reasons to adopt Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigriray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigerray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood loss.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a eruption in 2005, after thousands of protestors protested against elections, which, according to analysts, appeared to have been dismissed and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the following raids, many protestors were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months and this period of rest went relatively fast.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leaders for their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misappropriation.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protestors in Gondar, an Amharic city, were attacked by Tigerray's business and the hate against Tigerray is becoming increasingly common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into their own position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over nearby Somalia, even though it recently reported that it has closed this base.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want its allies to unite in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gardening."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS to be "sarcasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disrupt the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his multiple repeated allegations, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic States, not seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions on the communication capacity of the presidential candidates of the Republicans whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the US public.
It also brings his disputer who are trying to protect him during an evental phase, in the real position to explain statements that he might not even have meant.
After making the announcement at a midweek election event, Mr. Trump returned to the charge on Thursday and said in interviews that he did not really mean that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the charge was completely serious.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt Trump wanted to help Mr. Trump make some mistakes by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to destroy him, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism strikes Mr. Trump, while he is trying to link his campaign focus to the economic slum.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to come back to this subject again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mr. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their talks long ago.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he gave strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he declared "Of course I meant the sarkasti".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries into politics and then to return to the necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "to clarify" after what the reaction is like." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways and ways.
Instead of abolishing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted another tone, as his refrigerants continued to return.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the United States of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to blame himself for his provocations, he often accuses his critics of ignoring his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he was building his attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal disputer into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how he may provoke his statements.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, gave a great deal of protection to the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mr. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbankers, completely wrong and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, who served as Foreign Minister in Mr Clinton, allowed ISIS to expand by letting it undermining the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to return to each of his words and take action against him.
He raised the "poor, mild" television experts who try to understand him and said, "They can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats apologized to Mr. Trump as another evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
First over the market price, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Caffe was a delicious coffee in Williamsburg where you could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were driven by his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locally, it was the last loss in a self-propelled city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a dream business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a recovery.
A renewed verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar bad atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Café, the owner and manager of the new Café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outlet, he was ordered to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has a lot of help.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He brought in new ingredients.
On the food map are sandwiches with spices and cheese and there are Garnages such as capern and soured bean.
There are natural travel shoes.
The Café no longer serves beer, so there are fresh shops for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers have also been tortured by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently one Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee drinks for a while, she said.
"It was clear to me that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again even if she replaces her usual Iced Coffees with a mixed Chai Tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the 2003 verb.
He went to work there and ordered endlessly all the same.
"I came on Thursday after seven, every day, like a Swiss cashout and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with Speck, Ei and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't mean any noise about having taken over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soup for verb with the frozen coffee of the coffee.
"I think we're still going to go on your offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish Greenpoints have also accepted the Café.
A new customer has translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he is about to release it soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has additional facilities.
A local soft spot wants to fill and sell the frozen coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the Café extends to a nearby building.
For many customers there is a new verb to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a native customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the Café was closed.
When the new coffee opened, White said that the presence of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressed food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal time"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced his lunches to the Oval Office.
As a fan, President Roosevelt had a fable for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as Páte de foe gras and Maryland Waterschild cream soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat decisive: filled eggs in tomatoes sauce, cardiopulpurie and as a dessert a flower pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was from the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Ziegelman in his book "97 Orchard" tells us about life in a house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest collaboration, "A decent meal time", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snow-free imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with cardboard powder and mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this was found suitable for a discussion on food in the era of major depression.
"A lot of food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was earthnus bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from a juice and something cheap that extends the juice.
Imagine eating so many vegetables that they serve them as dinners.
Coe grente.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's crew bought for men's field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hundreds of Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" refers to the way the country reacted to being no longer the slave country.
"It was a time when food for Americans became a central, exciting subject," Coe announced, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also very exciting: secret food such as bread and casseroles were used as basic foods to reevaluate the casserole as "a wonderful sort of food, rest of it," noted the mayor, since the kitchen could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rare serviced luxury.
Personal mixes were tested as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction was preferable to taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era with groundnus butter.
"There was no more popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
"It was surreal."
Groundnut butters and ground-knives don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have adopted the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and the challenge of turning potatoes into cream spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical dancers.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hunger strike are particularly delicious, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen- holding.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa Farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he eats like the millions of men from the world he has become.
"He ate continental cuisine like fish with gorken sauce," said Coe.
He was in a pretty golded dining room and took a smoking.
He was very real.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not urged him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the anheuern of a housekeeper showed no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt that the white house produced the longest meal in Washington, but also one of the most reliable preparations."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era, to be treated with food, were rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet.
The power lies in our continued focus on calories and food, says Ziegelman, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
In writing the book, the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's foster mother - for example, how she could not discard food.
"She had a real fear of the use of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
Then there was the wind exchange.
After the tellers were away at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled up a dessert they had prepared at home: the flower dessert, which President Roosevelt said on Wednesday.
"It's called Prune Whip," said the mayor and added that it was a common trick to miss certain recipes for a send name.
There were no slaughtered pigs, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water and lemon.
Everyone had something against a ceiling in the eye, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe was attacked three times.
As a Can-Do-Budgeter said to his wife, "A few hacked Walnuts would help."
He was killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
The 30-year-old has now died of a fass bomb attack on the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to photo show, saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2900 Volunteers set their own lives on the game to get people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the field of war.
They're the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him at a 11-hour rescue of a child from the drummers of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the acid into a light symbol figure in the glory of the war.
As Hellen never saw himself, he said in his own image: "For me this is the true Jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself was attacked by the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters fired four fass bombs across the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children don't play with it," quoted the picture of his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have terrorist attacks.
Greenland: The oldest liver is almost 400 years old
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Greenlandhaie comes to the surface only in winter.
This Hai had to go back to the sea after an investigation by the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland has only received 150 years of age.
The Greenlandhai slowly swims along the north coast, within an hour it reaches just 1.220 meters.
Only when it comes up, the five-metre-long animal speeds up to 2.6 km/h and is half as fast as a robbe with this maximum speed.
This long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the magazine "Science" at any time from a Greenlandhe who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for wild animals.
Although Evolution biologists have long suspected that Greenland will be rocked.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenlandhaie is difficult to observe, and eventually they live mainly in the Ice Sea before the thinly conquered coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually fall on the surface only in the winter.
Researchers know little about the life-style of Greenland.
Their time-limits measure them when they are equipped with six animals in front of the peak mountains with a transmitter.
Despite these sharks, researchers found in the stomach of an animal the rest of a robbe, another had shut down the bones of a young Eisbark.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol them on the basis of the ice sea and search for Cadaver, which flows from higher waters to below.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now studying 28 Greenlandhaie, who were considered fishermen from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as beifang from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres were measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the
This center of the eyeline is already created before the birth of the haie containing proteins are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when the nuclear weapons tests were leading to greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the least three-footed animals with 220 centimetres, the lynchenkers included a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so they should have celebrated their 50th birthday in 2012.
In contrast, all the larger Greenland had normal carbon-14 quantities in its lens core, created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the 14-hour carbon showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland, while the record-Hai must be 502 centimetres even 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai females were known only when they were more than four meters long.
Now the researchers were able to assign an old age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres may have stood on the threshold for sex and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland is evidently at least one and a half century old.
That must also be the world record for wild animals today.
The fact that such methusale lives mainly in dry waters is no accident.
Even the record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland waltz, in which a 120-year-old harpoon spot on his neck was caught before Alaska.
The low temperatures also often lead to the organism of the animals living there.
So they're going to be slower later and older.
To keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heats.
The loss of heat by a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains Evolution Biologist Schuerlein.
A very large animal should rather invest its resources in a longer life.
Base Card in Double Pack
The Community Council at its recent meeting on building issues has taken a very serious view.
With ease, the Gremium took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "only the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can begin".
After clarifying the basics, partitioning and settlement issues and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of the basics in the residential areas "Straßweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - Construction Section 1) is no longer in the way.
The Community Council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential village of Schönau speak equally to young families and young adults.
As was the case, construction volunteers can immediately report to the Council, which is expected to be consulted by the Council at its September meeting.
In order also to allow applications for the allocation of additional companies related to the creation of jobs, the Council decided to amend the area use plan set up in the early part of this year.
In the area of sub-periods, the business area already designated there will be extended to two parts of the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
As a result, the city in Main has the best opportunities to attract job losses and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Brexit Voigtländer," says Michael Voigtänder, Head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether monetary households can continue to operate from London from financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been granted permission in Britain.
It's just a big U.S. bank.
Several banks have already announced lowering jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10,000 new jobs in Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk score.
While in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its main seat, this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The approach to the note bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is a large fund industry, it is as bad as Dublin in infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach because of the large airport.
In addition, the city has easy access to commercial property.
"It's not even that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
In addition, the rentals for first-class business properties are about 50% higher than in Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company council, the city stands at seven, Luxembourg on 19th place, Dublin on 33rd place and Paris on 37.
Even if quality of life is a matter of love: "With its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW continues.
However, although London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
There are also strong conditions: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba End 2015 there were 62500 people in the banking sector in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim for reimbursement of the costs incurred by you from Hepatitis C legal conflict with Merck & Co Inc pharmaceutical company.
In June, Gilead was released from a fine of $200 million for the destruction of two patents from Merck, which were related to the blockbuster meds Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. rich man discovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including mineid and other unethical actions.
When the complaint was filed on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had claimed to have the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck claimed to have been accused of each other and claimed ownership of laboratory works based on Sofosbuvir, the active substance in the medicines of Gilead.
US-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manby by the Islamic State
From the US-supported troops, the full control of the northern city of Manbzi has returned to the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters left them in the city, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) have come after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians who were held as hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish shared the Manbí Military Council of Reuters, which is connected with the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we're just doing space work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in a US$ 10.75 million income and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons USD 1 million spent on well-being, mainly on the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton won nearly USD 5.3 million in Redehonoren; the former Foreign Minister paid US$ 3 million from the Sales Simon & Schuster for their book on their official time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hilly Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false charges and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements even though they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities on grounds of his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests were completed.
Trump Critics, including the Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012 Mit Romney, have already made it possible to avoid issues relating to property, its spending on charitable organizations, its entrepreneurship and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already been involved in the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which the high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax declaration to be published.
On Thursday she also discussed the subject during a talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to publish his tax statements," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s during two years, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who state that this could still be the case.
Federal tax has become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and Investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffet whose seat Berkshire Hataway Industrially Glomerate is here to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he had also been refused a tax test of the IRS and Trump had "angst" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's Campaign has published a tax declaration back until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, average paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that they refer only to USD 100 of their income as a reward, other than most of all Americans.
Its main currency base was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clintons dividends and income from USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipider, promote fireworks Tanzania Elephant Protection
Natural protectionists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to keep elephants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on those who are full of chilipiders.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and homes without harming animals.
Before, many spies used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Telefant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, where they are much more likely to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," said the businessman of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the light of the elephant with a stick and the glass into a horn.
If he's not fired, a so-called "chiliwolk" will be fired.
Chilipider mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworker in a condom, whose end is drawn to the sun.
When it is healed, the condom is placed with a knife and pours fine dust into the air at Chilipider.
A hole is usually already ready to swallow the elephants.
One last possibility is a publisher who throws a gold mine into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
The city road is decided unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects of business operators with kusshand - however, only the retail trade in the core city is clearly efficient.
However, the city's contract was now reimbursed by the application for the renewal of a sales ski on the railway station near the direct vicinity of the railway balcony in construction.
"In principle, we welcome new businessmen, but at this site in an exposed position at the Reheinufer this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director calls Berliner Hotel because Israel's choice was removed from "Arab" demand - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots designed a media equipment after he had mentioned that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli choice, as Arabic guests said an employee "had been asked".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his pastor at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not registered between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinkski Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel over its own Call Center.
After a statement, the director went to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "scoffed him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel owner said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason behind this was the fact that more noise was released in the register.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded the election to be deleted," was quoted by the employee of Lanzmann.
The Israeli messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were tired and scared of this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed to this hotel chain in Germany is even more damaging.
No explanation is required.
We expected the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the officer.
The event solved a rather great resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "dedicated" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Exhaust you," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel located near a synagogue is located at the noble curfürstendam.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges from itself and called the incident a "see" and "debt" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There has never been a direct indication," Israel did not enter the Quick List," quoted a speaker from the Kempinski Hotel in the South German newspaper.
It adds that the country choice has now been added.
Police stationes Trenengas & Gummies against protesting Brazilian students
The students took part on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms to the public education system.
The police set up trains and rubber boots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties arise when police officers try to get the students together, leading to the use of rubber bags and trains.
Several hundred students participated in demonstrations to express their admiration for the plans.
According to the proposal of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti against the former President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests took place a few days after demonstrators in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from the office by a vote of the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, grew by 70.9 per cent in the year between Moscow and Tehran.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has increased strongly, the messenger shared with them.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, the Russian imports in Iran rise by 91.5 per cent and account for $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rise by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade movement was achieved by delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the messenger.
Dzhagaryan leaves a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
In the last year, about 35,000 visas were issued by the Russian Foreign Service to Iranian citizens.
Moreover, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One might say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the messenger hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Searched: Drinking market in forest oil
A robbery occurred on Thursday at the wine market of Rewe XXL at the forest brüler Gerberstraße.
In the case of a shooting weapon, three dark-eyed persons who had blinded their faces demanded the release of bar money and then fled to foot first and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was spent, the police don't share.
The deaths should be between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and badly visible from the rewe market's park deck.
After the crash towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg must be evacuated from the Schutter Parking Place located opposite the parking road with the silver-coloured car, possibly heading B 256 (schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations about the time (at 19.45 p.m.) related to the robbery should report immediately to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer time
Eight beautiful and fun days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social work of the Child Protection Union Nagold with their managers at their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlaker.
In the quiet holiday home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school.
Several day-to-day flights were on the program.
For one, it went to Bretten with the visit of the striker.
To the other side of Maulbronn, where there was a special childcare in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Kelten Museum in Hochdorf, the group has a lot of experience about the daily food and diet of the Keltens.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which contributed to springing, swimming and planking.
Cullinary, children and caregivers with their own prepared food such as the Sauren Late, the Seabroner Pfänle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of pearls and stones were created or made from wood a Roman mollusc game.
Other highlights of leisure were the angels in a nearby tent, the evenings at fire and the final "Bunte Night".
On the day of the journey home, the sun and the children and young people enjoyed their return home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the Promotion of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villalingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were handled.
In order to extend the time to the next Romwall trip of all ministers within two years, the Prime Minister round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various Wall Road objectives were examined and finally decided for the city of Freiburg, where this year, due to the sacred year of mercy with the open port of mercy at Freiburger Münster, was offered a special Pilger objective.
16 Minas from the source of bittel, groool, Haygerloch, and the rooms of the sanctuary were on the way.
On the night before, Father Storost sent the Pilger out in a small festival in St. Anna, won the Pilger Cross and shared the Pilger's victory.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a monstery of Our Love Women stands and thus the Pilgerway was represented by the monstery.
Each morning and evening, the individual day-to-day tour was surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
But also along the way, the Ministries of Field Crosses, Chapels or Churches have always been able to sing together a song from their own collection of Pilger songs.
For the nights, each parish of the local parishes was available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi served at the stage goals for a tasteful breakfast and breakfast.
On the second day, it went over forcing to go to Gütenbach.
On days after that, the steps to St. Peter, which were the most difficult route, had to be lifted at the first time in the cold heat of about 500 altitudes and then rescaned again.
The deserved reward was a common cry on the bathroom at night.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of Pilgerday in the imposing monastery of St. Peter, it went to the closing stop to Freiburg.
The minis arrived on the following afternoon at Freiburger Münster and passed through the havens of mercy.
With a small pulse here, God was thanked.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minister of co-operative Markus Obert, who came to the target of Pilger, was welcomed.
After the service of God, the Pilgers were able to visit the Sacristei and the Hochaltar.
The next day there was still time for the brake gauge.
Afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.
Shooting Callum Skinner running home when British Gold for racing
Scotland's Callum Skinner died last night in the men's Sprint in the Vélodrome in Rio as the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the role of Landsmann Sir Chris Hoy, who had made himself his own. The youth pund made the legend proud when he flew home to hide a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy held the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They resumed the trip after they held only a certain sixth place in London in March at the World Championships in spite of the return trip to Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Ambassador Jamie Staff.
They did this right away as Hindus.
Hoys tranquility created a luxury that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man she stayed with when she saw potential in the shadow that had now fallen.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners put an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindi almost got back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and took it off.
A strategic change made a major part of the transformation, with the Hindu moving in a higher turn to attract him and it made it possible for Kenny and especially the skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny and Hindus as they climbed onto the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a funny comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the vicinity and won the world's master.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindus claimed that after a weak start, he fell on the road.
He later returned this statement and there was no complaint from England's Rivalen.
In such an overwhelming victory there was no such problem this time.
Hindus said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribe like London."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We've gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven of the 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If it's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we're expected to be successful five days in the Velod room.
With the form of Kenny, it is in the area of the possibility that he wins three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - the 12-year-old Hoy who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly sacred date for the British sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Banister) - a performance of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's Hoy's coming.
Kenny participates as the next part of the Sprint, which starts today and will be gone in three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be killed for the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doul qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won in London gold in 2012, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition when the Wiggins will stand safe in focus.
He had fought with officials before his qualification yesterday when he was called by his executive to measure his body size.
In the respective women's competition, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a score on medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dashed.
It played dramas in the background, so the return of technical leader Shane Sutton in April was between sexism and motivations as well as the quietness of such sizes as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodroom, it looks like the more casual call of GBs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment can be repeated.
The future of Portland’s meltdown due to the suspension of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake as the plant operator announces the energy contract and thus terminates all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies for the operation of the facility.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years shall be issued in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be effects of dominodominal effects, as the Schmelseriei consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which last year led to a closure of the Anglosea power plant.
Alcoa's skiing series in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the annual estimates regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and ultimately as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which provides the large aluminium mill with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three other owners are going to announce their contracts.
The facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Aluminum, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubien Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL is concerned that the facility in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity by the power chain," the company shared.
AGL further stated that the so-called "security business" contracts should have been in force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month expiry date so that they will end in 2017.
"From that point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17th business year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasting of the strong long-term markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL shared that it had already written the value of the contracts in its year-end of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel contracts, "The ability to operate Alcoas... the power to operate or provide electricity to the mill" did not affect the decision.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have been in force since November of this year, even if it is still an explanation why it has been withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn about the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the statement of the analytical beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
Should both installations be removed from the market, this would mean a significant reduction of demand on the [stream market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as power generators," he said.
More than just a Cardashian Realty TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and four daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner-Clans Kristis is on the cover of the popular September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and loved the fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love brought me the look of this envelope into wine," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the Cover followed a weird (or simply keeping up with the Cardassians like?), a written reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn and the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot their sister's cover and ended it with a classic application: they all planned a surprise party.
This is almost every birthday period for a child (Siacrest brought the phrase "You think we've forgotten you?" with the honesty of a sign-trick chain at a post station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Krissis had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somewhere.
In view of the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Cardassians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have killed what happened to Vogue-Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were there in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a range that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of businessmen (according to Fashionist, 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages were advertising).
The interpretation of its Coverstars is so widely expected that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been provided even before the official publication.
Women who were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been clearly more "prominentness, models" than "models, which are famous" on the cover.
Oscar-priest and Dior-Marken Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the Cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described in the magazine as the "throughbreak model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These fames are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything happens to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who are enrolled in the maintenance industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had published Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course Jenner's success isn't for everyone.
Jenner's position in the model world has always been somewhat tense with her realty TV history.
In June, Victoria's only secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the myth of the moment."
These feelings were bought up again when the message came up with the appearance of Jenners on Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be going beyond the point to prepare for the failure.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
She's going for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.
She sells from her photograph of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her leisure time she's to see on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Shortney and her children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are withdrawn from the Community law centres each year, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five people - mostly older persons, immigrants, help-needed workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair delegations and similar ones - are denied free legal advice and legal assistance when they apply.
Legal services of the Community which are already overloaded are being prepared for further reductions.
Since June the next year, it is expected that these legal centres will lose more than 30 per cent of their federal funds.
The Director of the Community Law Centre of Queensland, James Farrell, said that the last gathering of the National Association of Community Law Centres had resulted in thousands of people being dismissed each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be even worse without a suspension of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's Community Law Centres are funded from time to time, which means that thousands of people of important services you need will be denied," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with overwhelming and pressing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this account shows that they cannot get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce its funds by 30%, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Minister of Justice and the Secretary-General of the Federation, as well as the senators of Queensland George Brandis, to step up these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they have legal problems.
In the last year, the Government has fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to consider the needs of the Community centres and their clients and that the Palaštuk Government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign accused after employees alleged to have taken up arms
New York: Donald Trumps Campaign has been accused of alleged unemployment since she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had sent a gun to a staff member in February while they were on their way to a jeep.
The case will be described in an interview that was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte's national court by Vincent Bordi, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordi said he had been waiting for months for the matter to be settled inside before he realized that "that wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and ran the run in Vincent's kidney," Bordí responded in his complaint.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordi found that at least four other people had already done the same experience with Phillip, he wrote in the complaint.
"We don't have to fire weapons to repair damage," Bordi said.
The complaint is only two days after the Republican presidential candidate released a protest when he said a number of people in North Carolina that "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be held.
Trumps Campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of the context and that he would not engage in violence.
Bordoris Complaint requires damages from the campaign to damage the care obligation and from Philip because of physical injury and persistent physical damage.
Trumps Press Speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local newsman in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a partner of the campaign.
On calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, no response was received.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is based on Mr Bordi v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Question before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This raises representative questions from the INSA Research Institute for the "Picture" presentation (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue its rule, this is not possible after the polls in Berlin.
In both German countries, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to appoint the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent.
The party therefore raises questions only shortly before the CDU, which could return to 23%.
The third place is between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (up to 18.4 percent), which would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country.
The greens, despite slight losses of 6 per cent (before 8.7 per cent) are coming back into the heavy land day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent of each country.
In Berlin, the SPD of the survey was only 23 per cent (Selection 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the links with 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Commons.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could expect a return which would cost the pirates against 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelife: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.
Today, the successor dominates the world’s producer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.
The built-in memory initially consisted of eight megabytes, which would be available today for about two selfies with a high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communiqué" came to business just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they come somewhere from the time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago the communiqué was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer show Cebit in Hannover as "Office in West exchange format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of text messages and e-mails for immediate standards, even by fax.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even if it was relatively slow.
A fax computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be picked up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could know in August 1996 that the communication of the beginning of the smartphone would become.
Since then everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone-sparte of the find experienced an unprecedented disaster, finally sold and developed on Microsoft.
The market is now dominated by suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always be online and everywhere, that's today for very many people every day.
There were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, leaving only 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple.
The world trade with the equipment is around EUR 400 billion.
The well-run business comes from the free app provider and the telecommunications company.
Around the smartphone was created between a whole industry.
The decisive break to the mass market came in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicater to manage everything by touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who managed the market, had the following.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The words now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-defense after 20 years.
On average, each German looks at his phone every 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to remove the smartphone even once," said Janina Kugel, in Siemens staff representative.
Permanent availability is at the same time as flight and blessings.
England must link the Olympic Spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only to our local communities and to the whole of London but to the whole country of renewal and prosperity.
For me this was the greatest attraction Heathrows, just like it was in 2012 in London, when we worked a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics benefited greatly from Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we are going to create 10,000 new jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and the youth unemployment in the airport will end.
As they were before us in London 2012, it will be given to those who will think that the challenge of extending Heathrows is too large.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be criticized on the world stage.
The two were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
How the Olympic Games are Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180.000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave a wealth of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - the five-year selection of the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built between the two most frequent stages of the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to link this Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow as well as to ensure our future trade and create a power of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz-and-mouse game" about display blocking
For companies that earn money online, according to one of the software manufacturer's attempts to turn display blockage into a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block back advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads in order to make it difficult to identify the part of the site advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to move new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-Her fight between the advertising Open Source Community and the environment has been on its way since the discovery of advertising blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong index of how it has become an alarming advertising blocker for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide are using a study from Page Fair and Adobe in the last year; almost four times as many as 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users every day who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising is 84% of Facebook advertising.
The company viewed it on display blockers on desktop PCs as mobile display blockers had no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker shared with.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes up a large part of the revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step as a reward.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "display preference tool" to give people more control over their intended advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be concerned about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"It is not a positive experience for the user, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an e-mail message.
Indicator blockers are a slow means, so instead we focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Transmitting a woman at probably suicide on a Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a car on Thursday morning at a possible suicide killing of several vehicles.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman stood in the dark "in an act of confusion" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a Swiss man who was 49 years old who wanted to be killed by several vehicles, including a truck.
She's still dead in front of the place.
Several drivers have already been arrested, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who urged these and all witnesses of the case to report.
An investigation procedure was opened which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstette shared with Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a combination preventable?
That's something the state attorney has to decide," Hofstutter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person died in the darkness on the road - it was decided that the drivers should not go out that a pedestrian is walking in the middle of the night on the road, as it was in the newspaper.
Last year a police officer of the innocent murder was released after she had crossed over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 night near Payerna in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court took.
The court found that the police -- who had responded to a notice -- was in a fair and fair manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very unusual and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Any person who has further information about the event on Thursday near morning should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surfaces and CO2-dated atmosphere could have demonstrated a pleasant condition.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its intense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, deep atmosphere and still slow forward.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but it had just enough water and geographical diversity to sustain life and protect it from rapid pollution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent fat.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its day-to-day side of the sun almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rainscreen to remove the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model highlighted a history of Venus, similar to that of evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was probably only possible to live, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to heat and ultraviolet light.
Her oceans were melted and her water pumped out of ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogens disappeared, there was only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly effect of woodwork -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Hockey's operations at Colorado Avalanche and led to a very low degree of codecision in the team's decision-making process.
The Deputy President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking for a new trainer immediately.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey's operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, patience and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, which is necessary and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with those of the organization.
He must also have a co-decision law which affects the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, whom Roy had arrested on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer in the League during his debut season in the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the Union to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was killed in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the next season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in season 2015-16 and fall behind the forest for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference around five points.
As Hall of Fame Towart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Seafarers are re-examination of talks, setting out lines
The fight against unemployment for North Sea oil workers is suspended, while all parties to the conflict are put at the table for a new round of talks, said the negotiating leader.
Strikes against the wood service provider Wood Group were performed sporadicly on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the units and RMT cooperatives can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the process of reform of the current dispute," it means in a joint statement.
We will hold some whole-day meetings in the following weeks, beginning next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group has cut the rates on its contractors in the North Sea around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The company's discount is followed by a 10-percent decrease for Onshore carriers in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through the market.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to release its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its activities as a result of its mega-related interaction with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower raw materials prices, an economic situation that had been strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with employers this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that has taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea on average about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of stars in the starhead of the Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler World Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades Star Station.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star range and how the rotation periods are related to planetary position.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The starhead of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this galaxy, created about 125 million years ago, are now getting older.
They're turning around as soon as possible.
On top rotation rates, these rising stars were large amounts of stars.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star flake -- like sunflakes --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars slow down rather than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, where larger stars turn slower pirates as smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, where faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the starhead of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare more stable qualities like rotational rates.
"The Plejaden Stargate offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much ahead of us about what we want to know more about how, when and why stars want their rotational rates to hang up and say their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspapers their latest analysis of the pledging rates that will soon appear in the Astronomic Journal.
A controversial Baseball Star game
The trains run at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in the best days of Base to Base.
After his emotional return recognition, the 41-year-old professional will take the trip to his New York Yankees on August 12th against Tampa Bay Rays for the last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Godby' to both," declared the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player of the League, 2009 won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract protected him from 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a future consultant and youth coach - in full compliance.
As a player it paid Rodriguez long time with performance back.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and from 2005 to Yankees he created several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fema members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old must not be included in the Baseball's rest hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - top name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so his appearance is out of place.
In 2009, the Superstar at "ESPN" had to take steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was stopped for 211 parties due to developments in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been a major suspect for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the spre was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The League could have made me a mistake for 2014 because I've spent 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
Also, his days of separation do not go by without notice.
While many baseball legends in their last games were once again getting the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a decision-making tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson, sympathetic awareness of the fans of the Yankee Erzrivel Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," sang the adjectors at the 4:9 sub-assembly against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Discovered: Because of a positive doping test, weighttheber Adrian Zielinski cannot start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympics 2016 are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A trained athlete would have won almost a medal.
Prior to the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese Swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre-Hindernist Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weighttheber Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil – immediately before the start of the critically-acquired light-telling competition, these messages are coming to an end.
In Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already tested, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmeterling, just 0.09 seconds she lost the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the walk over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-test and listen.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigation", Xinhua quoted a statement, "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of Justice CAS and accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for punishing sportsmen with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the message about the positive sample at Danekowa, which took 33 years into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV transmitter BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the Light Tatyhethin.
The report should then be addressed to the prohibited substance for the blood clotting agent EPO.
Dankowa has been suspended provisionally, according to BNT the B-test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism at the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We are being watched, so many have already been excluded."
In this way, almost all weights from the chronic doping-loaded nation shall not be involved in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympicsman in the class of up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days before positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both compete with the admissions, but they must not start within the class up to 94 kg.
In particular, before the start of the lighthouse, Dankowa is a further serious obstacle to the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF World Federation had denied the launch of the complete Russian army until a derogation from systematic doping, and Kenya's driving company was producing a number of bad news in Rio.
In the skiing sport, the former trades in China also provided for strong austerity replacements between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang.
"Sun Yong pinkelt lila."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to pass it on to me," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun also stood at the centre of an austerity with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for Doping Beetrüger," he said.
Sun was tested in 2014 at the Chinese Masterships positive on the Trimetazidin Stimulant, but only a dreamy spre had to be removed.
Data Color: So Perfide print your solvent hacker
Programners of pressure malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware-reversive specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies interviewed in the past 12 months have been at least once, partly multiplely victimized by an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already a single target of ransomware.
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the aunts to re-use the affected systems and data.
The tattoos specialize in their printer software according to the observations of malwarebytes regarding attacks on company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential for pressure money falls significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently observing an amazing rapid evolution of the software," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in a conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the Fathers discovered printed software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred quickly in the past months.
Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it seeks for recently modified files such as word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files lock the ransomware and delete the original sustainable.
The software then presents the requirements of the printers.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victim must submit money - mostly in the form of encryption Bitcoin -.
However, where the personal photo database is on the game for private users, it is for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases that do not stop production.
The damage appears significantly higher when a ransomware is added.
22% of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13% even had to completely break down business, in case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks that can be severely threatened by the loss of hospital nights.
"We always say the victims: don't pay, you just promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.
It is difficult for a manager, in view of the state of silence in the operation, to deny the demand of the fathers.
The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user surfaces and contact with the printers and come to the result: The fathers are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay per bitcoin, turn free of available support websites into or unlock other examples files.
And when private people are released after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate closely and pay five-place sums in order to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risky gains from ransomware pressure, hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
It is more likely, however, that it is about three or four people.
The programmers then sell their software in the form of a software buildup to the actual printers.
The previously malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"To the extent of delivery, there is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The printers are then looking for further hackers to distribute the fresh software purchased under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one enters one of the forums in the background, buys the set of a criminal and calls for another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Criminals are apparently responsible for spreading spammers," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is still known in many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT respondents in the malwarebytes survey are confident that ransomware can reverse through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the players are already following new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful printing, the fathers will rather secure the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
As a result, damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the aunts could also take on a whole new target on the Internet of things on the ground.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they were able to obtain a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such blocked heating could be so sometimes a ransom.
If the plants then instead of heating in the future block a whole manufacturing street in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cup and also the diversity of a minivan.
Sounds quite overload, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually considered flexible every day.
Although only 1,60 m high HR-V works smaller, passengers both in the first row and in the Fund have a lot of space, it does not work at any point.
The materials in the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit surface falls off.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the store.
There is not only a safe room of 453 l at heights and 1026 l at rounded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seating areas of the back bank can be raised like Kinosessels and offer a store that is from the ground to the roof of 1.24 m.
The safe room can be loaded well, but the load height is slightly higher than in the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-piece with 88 kW/120 PS speeds the HR-V with the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide drive ranges.
However, he could do something less.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-irradiated drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the link must be something more direct.
The equipment is not allowed to open in the tested "executive" top variant.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Emergency Assistant (working up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Spurhalte Assistant.
The collision warning is sometimes irritated because it is considered to be a "relative object" in the ranking of many obstacles.
The fireman works very confidently.
And the intelligent time ruler responds to the identification of traffic and speeds when necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch screens, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the armrest and are therefore to be achieved on a regular basis.
The approximately EUR 29000 for well-equipped top parts are in order.
Anyone who does not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With HR-V, Honda offers a varied and everyday car.
Airline does not hold: Storm on the airport bridge
An airline does not hold a passenger's seat on the airport bridge.
Because a liability is only possible in the event of risks which are typical of air traffic, the Upper Zealand Court of Justice argued Düsseldorf (Az. 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knife at the storm.
However, the accident could have taken place everywhere - it was a general risk of life, so the court ruled.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damage.
Disease: When the organizer pays
Sick leavers will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is no doubt found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
On the second day of their Turkish leave, a family was seriously affected by accidents and injuries.
She spent almost all her vacation in the room.
Her illness led the patient back to a defective clearance system that was supposed to have wiped out the seawater.
The family was the view that the trip had been inconceivable - and complained against the organizer.
The complainants had no success before the Court.
Although the clearance system was actually defective.
However, the organizer will only be briefed before the complainant is released.
Until then, he had to leave that the seawater was okay.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No contamination was found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by touching each other - is a general risk of life.
Only 38 of the 691 guests were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State must be aware of and decide to respond to terrorist attacks at the same time.
It is certain: Our country will not respond to the violence of the fathers with hatred and columning.
We're not going to send this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals have to leave the country faster, it will increase security and strengthen the people's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 German election.
He also announced further personal strengthening of security forces, although "in the medium-sized regulation over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance should be improved so that the right to arms is renewed so that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is forced.
The most recently discussed Swiss duty for doctors should remain in line with Maizière's words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with a view to some mental accidents.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers had to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden detectors.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken against actionism.
"That was a horror for the screenmaker in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspaper of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously withdrawn appeal from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double state liability.
A general ban on full education is considered to be a problem for constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you can, and I'll take off Burka's clothes.
You can talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses before court.
Green Chief Simone Peter told the Minister that he wanted to simulate the effectiveness and operational capability of the new anti-terror packages.
Mr. Bernd Riezinger said: "Frequent languages and a violation of the right to stay no longer bring security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the road
This is a picture of November.
But this should change: the rule of law should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are on the busy road every night when driving on the road (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17 August) the country's road construction company extends the road between Hammer Street and Weseler Street by 700 metres.
Car drivers can then jump right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: Transport is becoming more early, thereby improving overall on the cross-border section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the district represented Münster-West.
The train agreement on the supplier is particularly nerveized by the car drivers between 17 and 19 hours.
Workdays reach the back of the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the fate of the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Street.
From here, traffic is only gradually reached through the highway bridges.
The second track had to be built back years before well-induced.
The reason: Statistical calculations have shown that the bridges no longer have the necessary bearing power to double the heavy loads.
As long as this Engpass and the associated working day-to-day stay are allowed, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated for years: because the bridge has an official life expectancy up to 2034.
For the extension of the rule of law, the country has been aware of the weaker transport time in the schools because it is difficult to calculate.
The transport is carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building.
Intercultural travel: Culture offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theater are planning a music project now.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has a presentation of the award-winning section "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Nima's Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age visited the insinuation in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has aimed at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most of the young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke a little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenes and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action yet, so the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from language, will work together in the next time in a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to visit professionally-trained courses in the fields of music, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and thematic language transmission are in the planning process.
The project "Intercultural travel" continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the association has many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the stars-nuckers in southwestern Germany a strike by count on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was bad enough for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectrum, said the president of the Star Warte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
It's about Persians that are 216000 kilometers per hour to the fastest stars.
They have your names because they appear to come from the star image of Perseus, which goes up in the northeastern.
Refreshing Night: Tips Against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you stay here forever, stay awake for hours at night, and tomorrow it's not too far to think about sleeping before the weekend.
That's all other than refreshing.
There are always such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than 10 percent often or repeatedly feel their sleep better than they do.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders appear?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be numerous reasons for them, stressed Hans-Günter Weßt, member of the German sleep research and sleep medicine company.
What you understand from the bottom is the dream, so it's a one-and-a-one destruction.
Just having to sleep many people feel dissatisfied or inadequate," says Jens Wagenknicht, a member of the board of directors of the German Homer Association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What's behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This may include organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not rarely is sleep disorder an expression of another illness.
"Very early awakening is particularly common in depression," says Wet.
And it can be that different factors are interfering with each other.
For example, someone who has a gang drive accident can be ill, waits for two to three hours and begins to worry about everyday problems and concerns, we have an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you be sleeping with a doctor?
Those who do not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and are affected by the day should go to the doctor.
The impact may seem quite different: it is osteoporous, mude, sleepless, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily reversible, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or head pain.
It is important to find out the causes of sleep disorder.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive treatment or even medicinal products - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks.
Low-level sleep healer is rarely available in Germany, according to Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary sleep health centre of Charité University of Medicine Berlin.
That is why you should first go to the housekeeper when you are having sleep problems.
He can explain with research whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the bedroom, and what's going on?
For the study in the sleep laboratory, physicians, for example, in the case of cutlery with athematosus, in the case of sick days, in the case of sleepers, or if the cause of a sleep disorder is not found, explain feetze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Please don't sleep at lunch," says Feetze.
After the cable you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal glasses, a brush and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the deck draws the sleepers.
How can those involved get the problem into the grip?
There are quite a number of artificial screws that you can use for a better sleep.
Weät refers to: regular sleeping and uptimes, not being in bed too long, not sleeping on the day, not watching alcohol, and not watching at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's not quite beneficial.
What to have the Dschungel Camp with missing medals in the Swimming
Former German Swimmer Markus Deibler appeared on Facebook to break up the DSV team at Olympics.
In December 2014, he first held gold in Doha at the short train world championships and at the same time posted his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has set himself up on Facebook to protect his former teammates from criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000€ premium and a Danish king should not surprise anyone about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports was bad, but doping controls were very good.
So we cannot compete with countries that are very encouraging and do not look exactly at Doping or even operate it.
"I don't say that controls should be put here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly what it should be with countries.
"He who cannot control WADA/FINA's independent control lamps must not take part in a certain time before the WM/OS," the voter asks, who is currently carrying out an ice section.
Airport: Bands of packaging tyres
Professional Diabetes at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civilians from Düsseldorf Police were arrested by two women and two men from 50 to 61 years of age.
The suspects had carried out several bag and pack holes as bands.
At 21.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized again a band known to the police from past theft.
Since mid-July this year, the two women and two men have been doing a number of good work and were doing it together, working part-time and particularly professionally.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can show the Diabetes who themselves have been involved in the prosecution of crimes to Germany four actions.
They had totalled over EUR 15,000.
Old buildings, a couple of Lindenbuffs, between the rest of the capitals: The Riga road in Berlin-Fridrichshain does not work in the first place, but the police number it into the "Dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you come to playgrounds, a frozen children's garden and a zoo.
At the fascade of a green house someone said "extremely!"
A house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built by 2017.
Articles about this "dangerous part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferred by burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: At first it was occupied, however, the residents of the rental contracts, but there are still rooms in the ground and are used for events.
Especially since the beginning of the year, Berlin's Interior Senator Henkel has been speaking several times for a strong police action against the project, which has been referred to as the "No-Go Zone" for the police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After on 22 June the rooms in the ground floor, which had been covered with 300 police officers, patrolled the police for three weeks following official statements by 30 to 40 officers and three local vehicles, stopped parts of the street and stopped visitors from attending the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, the premises were renovated by construction workers in the order of the unknown household owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room was illegal, and one day police and construction workers were fired under the jubilee of Sympathians and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go with children, people sit on the street in front of the houses in the sun, others stay late.
In the immediate vicinity of the home projects there are basic schools and childcare facilities.
Linke Violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly disappointed by the police presence.
With the residents of the housing projects, they share their concerns about increasing rents and generification.
It does not sound like a cheese which most of the police have sought protection from vandalizing links.
The graves, which the Berlin Internal Senator and the police are opening between housekeepers and their neighbours, are not so obvious.
In fact, Friedrichshain in East Berlin was a traditional job market, which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.
Also house crews and the housing projects from which they were born have been part of the castle for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost all Mainzer Street near Riga.
While the mains were covered by a regular street attack, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the city has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: people from DDR times and former owners share their choice with them.
This is also true of the rentals that have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.
Many of the novels in Riga are treated as symbols of this development: they are recognized on so-called discs or freshly lined façades that have been designed with colour buttons.
No other street has been mentioned this year so often with the words "linka autonomic violence".
One reason why not all of our neighbors might view it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: penalties such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the penalties result in business damages that tend to hit new and newly renovated homes.
For Kerstin Neugebauer who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no word of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is devastating: the people in the 94s are their neighbors who are not certain of it.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer directly available in Riga.
For the studied architects, their streets are not a criminal point of fire, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than strangers".
New builder is aware of being dragged into the Rigar Street and stayed.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all immediately demand the German government over the city.
However, in the eyes of residents like new builders, the streets will continue to be taken away: through invisible nuances in old dwellings that destroy the old residents.
"These are, of course, property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well-known," she says.
"Water and destruction I can't be absolutely good."
But what should you do if someone doesn't listen?
There is confusion on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For trainees who climb over colorful trees, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene were part of the cheese.
Whoever moves should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a cage can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deschle is a new refugee mission
Annika Deschle is the contact partner in matters integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker in front of the community.
Since July, Annika Deschle has been the refugee mission for Urbach.
The social pedagogical team supports the administration of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working circle refugees, administration, authorities and others.
Kingdom customers from the working circle point out that the officials are more than grateful that God is now there, the native walnut who has a problem in particular.
Thus, some - less excitingly than many of the many areas of responsibility - meant more than the administration wanted to write out the positions.
An administrative capacity has been sought with a talent for languages and people, linked to a long-term experience in social work, and a self-sustained wool mill.
However, administrative work is not her central area, it means Annika Godschle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people in front of and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31st year has been around six weeks.
She's been running a 50 percent job for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Customer that Annika Deschle is supported by honour-and-principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are on the waterway
A serious problem has been for a while to find apartments for the arrival refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the introduction of connections.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.
The costs of building, renting or refurbishing these apartments must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from Landrasamt to Kommune and Job Centre.
Problem: There are free items, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.
De facto does not find the administration private apartments.
It doesn't work until you're exposed to private homes, so Godless.
Therefore, joint apartments must be restored, as it is called beautiful.
So soon new containers will be placed in the waterway.
But it's not made with apartments.
Perspective is the touchword, regine customers and Annika Godschle are certain.
In addition to a stable stay, it is practical places, training facilities, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," Reine told customers.
Many work in the building or help household teachers, resulting in joint work - and this motivates and is very well reported by Annika Godschle.
It hopes that work for the Community will lead to a positive side effect.
It's "no treatment for employment".
But work doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Godschle and customer.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with natives and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So there are also government and officials in here.
It was central that the refugees felt that they were desirable and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can spend their time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
If someone ever develops the feeling, he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated.
The significant majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "People who don't even go to them." The work of God and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It's all already a "Mother" job.
A difficult question: Do the two following recent events fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Queen customer quite clearly, "what some might call naive." A prescription could and would not exclude them.
But the help has already been sensitized.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the attackers would put them in complete opposition.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
This means that the main and honourable members of the community and in the region need to take a look at activities.
They have always been in the background that soon a new stock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Do Germany need an upper limit?
This question is clearly answered by policy.
In fact, it's not fair to place them in front of them.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet," says Annika Deschle.
No new refugees that would slow down.
Kingdom customers also make it clear that the urbanists are already equipped to integrate intelligently from the past.
These are about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, you need to help them, both of them are single.
The political world situation is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Scratch Folder: Searched in by Hubschruber
The police officer flew out of different areas for about an hour.
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi-family house in Lindenway by 8:50 a.m. in the morning.
The residents were surprised by the two of them and struck down the people in the flight.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters large, perhaps masked, wearing both blue and black capuzzi.
They fled the city direction.
The police set up several stream crews as well as a police officer.
The arrest lasted without success.
If possible, the unknowns will fall close to the apartment relatively when they leave.
Baden-Württemberg: Police identified after Rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on an Ulmer Imbiss, the police identify six suspects from the Rocker Mileu because of a severe earthquake.
The police shared with the police on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like group had reportedly fired police in July bottles and stones against the shooting of an impasse.
Then they should attack two guests and hurt one easily.
Then they run.
At Imbis and the adjacent building, a damage of EUR 10000 occurred.
According to the researchers, there is a conflict in the Ulmer Rocker Mileu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
Thuringen: Seiss Meitec of the Million Trade
