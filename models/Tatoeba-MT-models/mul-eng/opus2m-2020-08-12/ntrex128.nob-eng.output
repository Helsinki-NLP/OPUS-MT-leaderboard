Members of the Wallis Parliament do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Wallis National Assembly, known today as the AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal will result from the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wallisian Parliament.
Representatives from all sides of the political spectrum fear that this may lead to latexification.
A representative from the Labour Party Labour explained that his group was concerned because "it is based on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "duste", and pwp means "best".
A representative for the Walls Party Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was "missing" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Wallisian part of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" for the change of name, but noted that the MWP’s speech is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some well-known figures, is also a British word for ‘dist’.
In this context, the walaisian letter W is spoken in a similar way as the letter U is spoken in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a ‘uh’ sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: 'Of course, it is the members who have the last right of provision in respect of which name they are to be mentioned.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the National Assembly permission to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing which showed general support for the reconvening of the National Assembly to the Wallisian Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives supported by the Welsh Parliament Members, but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose a number of other options, but obtaining all parties to an agreement may lead to the head-up of President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, will deliver a legislative draft for the change in the name within the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee system.
The representatives have the right to vote on what they are to be called when they debate the work of law.
Macedonians go to the voters to determine whether the name of the country is to be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on the name of their country to be changed to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a number of decades of disputes with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour is a requirement on their territory and has for several reasons opposed the country's applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a representative of the People's Party for the Name Change, has said he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Minister of State Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in the name is quite simple, and the price they have to pay for their participation in the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's style – the bells in Harlem Sliter
“The old people I talked to have told me that before that time there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
‘Now none of the parts are present.’
He said that the waste of the bars was understandable.
‘People are socially surrounded in other ways’ now to date, he says.
‘Bares are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.’
As regards the churches, he is afraid that the money from selling assets will not be as long as the leaders believe. "And sooner or later they are back at the start."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the type of people who will not help the remaining times of the neighborhood.
“The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors too well, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these facilities will become members of these churches.”
Both of them were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white metric unit moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had remained close to the building occupied it.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the hand of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers at 125th Street – one of Harlem's main tradesmen – because they never hired or encouraged black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Johnson’s son - in - law left plans for the reconstruction they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and successor at St. Martin's, boldly declared that the carillonet was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's during the last few months is a complex combination between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are the beginning of the church's legal course and others of the midsummer.
The Church Council of the Congregation, consisting of the legislators, wrote to the adjudication in July on its concern that the adjudication had come to ‘try to force the costs’ on the church council, although the church council had not been involved in the procurement of architects or entrepreneurs sent by the accedingory.
Some sleep children complained of lack of transparency by the side of the assistive judge.
Hai damages thirty-year-olds on hummer tyres in California
A series of attacks and damages a 13-year-old good when he looked for eggs in California on Saturday, the first day of the summer season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place about 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had covered with friends about half an hour's Saturday morning when he heard the guy call for help, and that he and a group of others drowned over to take the guy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the guy cried out of curiosity about having caught a hammer, but he realized that the guy cried 'I was scared!
I was scared!'»
His whole leg was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the gate.
"I called that everyone had to come out of the water: 'It's a hole in the water!' said Hammel.
The guy was transported with air-guarantee to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of hierarchical attack is unknown.
Badewatt Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Gilles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its entry into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warhaus-like beauty and beauty toys, equipped by highly trained staff.
The extended trailers are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is still growing while the sales prices for clothing and home articles fall. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will be extended to several shops next year.
Investment in beauty performance is a result of the supermarket's attempt to find a new area of use for the place previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty management products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be better placed in marked areas, just like in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket chain also relaxes its Boutique brand with main vegan products, as there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test the sale table in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network trade and a new trend to buy small quantities of food daily from local daily stores means that supermarkets must do more to slow customers down.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director for Sainsbury's said that sales after each came to look like more and more at a store store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl ticket shops with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. They say this increase has made food sales more profitable and more profitable.
The previous attempts by the Supermarket to upgrade the beauty management and apothecary departments failed.
Sainsbury's test of cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but cooperation was discontinued after a round of distribution of the income from the pathogens in the supermarkets.
The new strategy will follow that Sainsbury's sales of its 281 store cabinets to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy apothecary, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
They say Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding a selection of luxury hairdressers, including La Roche-Posay and Vichi, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty display halls to create more attractive environments for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained staff who must be so prepared to provide advice and assistance.
Our selection of brands is designed to cover all needs and the inviting environments and practical locations make us now a beauty management competitor representing a new business experience."
Peter Jones is "facing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The-Star Peter Jones must certainly be excited after a TV-ver Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand in order to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is program leader at This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' De-Star Peter Jones excited by withdrawing from their payable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold-bound contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was "rescuing" at an exciting meeting on Tuesday at his main business quarter in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television golden admitted that her new contracts – which are worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to go to their key and accessories, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated wealth at GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, leaving the United Kingdom on her way towards one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was obviously Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security in the next decade.
Everyone's completely shocked that she's chosen to move.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now a shop is full of goods at Marlow’s headquarters which are now ready for sale.’
Experts believe that this Morning Programme Leader, which is among the most popular stars of the United Kingdom, can spend millions of dollars on the company due to major investment in products such as powder and light, butter and coscular, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Dr. Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the director in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has 40% of the owner's share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the flag ambassador for M&S and shall be replaced by Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity TV programme.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We won't comment on his business affairs".
Check fact "and we loved it"
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media in order to have made a comment that some would consider as "high presidential", and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump gone so far?
said Trump in his comparison of a news channel.
‘I have not given up anything.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, even after having declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear equipment have been halted.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's High Diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the members of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a "compared response" from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States has continued sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a collection of his voters.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
"We have stopped going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a competitive relationship."
He said that his work to improve Kim's relationship has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helped to get rid of hostages and get the lives after American service people sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to act as presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this step-by-step arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed forward in the area.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an island and take the lives of hundreds of people
In the cold waters of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organisations were told that they did not need their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of the residents of Lomboks had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
‘In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is quite challenging,’ said Sumbung.
Red children are now joining a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the national state of crisis management, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to ensure that international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
In view of the constant exposure of Indonesia to earthquakes, the country is severely prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common view along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a warning sirens on Palu, although a notice was sent, has probably contributed to the death rates.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship which was stationed in Lombok to treat land-free is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade to Indonesia's fragile infrastructure to a major point in its election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the administration of Jokos, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, which members of the Muslim majority have gone beyond a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands were to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims marched into the streets with machetes, arrows, and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with later comparison in battle against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losses against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting in 89 minutes in the battle at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea target while his layer was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball dropped to the top right corner of the net.
The ball came to an end over a hopeful Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and the players that Shaq always sends the ball forward so well it can do, so I just tried to give me as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just spooked it further."
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with the wheel back to Matthew Kovacic before he changed direction near the middle of the road and printed it in Liverpool's half-way.
Kovacic came with a quick delivery on the central road.
He then had four of a great break-through arrangement that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and ran the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-wing park across Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the Championships League game at 15.00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in European football for men in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
Deaths from Tsunami in Indonesia at 832
The deaths after Indonesia earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, the country's crisis management unit announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were arrested in the ruins of buildings such as the quake after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 which framed the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, the state's figure Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from racist buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman has been beaten to death
A homicide investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "We're all in the beginning of the research, but I'm going to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially drug drivers, who may have caught something on their camera to contact – they may have information that is crucial to our research.”
A police figure has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
The following morning, friends who think they know the woman who arrived at the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have said they are working to inform the victim.
A drug dealer living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was arrested by telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a shelter.
A crying woman looked up at the place.
She repeats "it's so dangerous" about and about again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars behind the bridge, while a third car was standing outside.
A number of police officers were outside the parking lot and had oversight of the apartment complex.

Parliament's status of Cromwell is the last monument to be included in the ‘recording history’ column.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious taxes imposed by his fanatic Puritan allies.
But the history story of the Comell Society has described Jeremy Cricks's version as "dependable" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The British Civil War iconoclasm was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's wrong will be punished for the sins of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is evidence of the meaning of the 1800s and is part of a history of a man who thinks many still deserve to be rested.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell becomes many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, see what Parliament's defenses against pressure from outside – in his time it was of course the monarchy.
If this is a very accurate representation, it is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of the conflict.
His performances as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered."
Killing grass takes the life of Chinese beads
A Bond was attacked and killed by a grey on the market in South-West China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the name ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a refined pulse year near a feed on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A grey band is ready to place vaccines on grasses on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had certainly traveled with his fat man from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 greys on the market.
The morning after the fat man found him dead, and discovered that the door to a nearby pig market was open.
He said there was a big blood problem inside the pigyard.
According to the report, a legal medical investigation confirmed that the 250 kg bite had killed the man.
"The leg of my fat was bloody and maltreated," explained the fat, referred to by the name Wu, in a statement to Guiyang Evening News.
Emissions from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to eat his grass.
Like he was found around an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his fattie.
While the police are all proving from the scene, one of the market's leaders explained that the crisis was locked in order to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management negotiate certain compensations for the death.
Even though this is happening, it's not the first time it's recorded that a grey has attacked people.
In 2016 a grey man attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts and charged the man with serious damage.
Ten years earlier a Walisian bond was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg grey before the federal's wife was able to hunt the animal.
After a bane in Oregon was eaten by its grasses in 2012, a bane from Manitoba to CBC News explained that grasses are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood may have an exhilarating effect.
"They're just playing.
They look like little biting, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You must only show due respect.’
The rest of the Rosa Orcan will lead to a strong rain in the South-West US
As reported, Orcano Rosa is weakened by its movement across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, carry her spring bill on her voyage through North-Mexico and South-West USA during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind power of 135 km/h and was an organ of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train begins to form over the Pacific Sea and move east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to melt tropical moisture north towards the South-West USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm down in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the cooperation between tropical moisture and the nearby tree will lead to a wide range of strong rains in the south in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm rain will lead to dangerous floods, moving Russians and fast and possible earthquakes in the forest.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to drop rates up to 5-7 cm per hour in certain areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially in large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flows with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of the tropical rain.
It's very exclusive to move around in the forest of foot as long as it's a danger to tropical downhills.
Heavy rain can cause elvedals to become a wide-ranging melting stream, and drought will lead to local windcasts that can contain dust and sand.
The question approaching will lead to local strong rain forests for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall above 1,3 cm is possible and this can lead to liquid Russians and fast, as well as smooth viaways.
This will be the first downturn of the region.
Some scattered tropical rain forests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before the rain falls later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rains will spread to the horny states on Tuesday and will last all Wednesday.
October can lead to intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as Arctic is getting colder, but the tropes are very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over shorter distances.
We want to see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the whole Central US Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and eastern USA will probably get a hot start on October, with high degrees on the twentieth from Southern Plains to parts of North-East US.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East-USA will most likely have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at the Board of Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million more, distributed on six TV networks, so the day's arresting testimony from High Lawyers Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was due to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political party continued, and circulators broke their usual messages to announce the great surprise of the Friday in the last second, when it was announced that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Because the Senate's court committee told her that she was 100% sure that a retired Kavanaugh ordered her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school.
In a patient witness burden, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably made by more than 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average serial numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
In particular, it was not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the nose usually has problems with measuring officers.
To give a little perspective, this serial number corresponds to the final game in the American football championship or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose meanings have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led by the network, with an average serial number of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two by 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras by trying to take the horse to a meeting of the court committee while demonstrators screamed at him.
He had a low look for several minutes while he was exposed, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing here like you," said one woman.
"Do you trust him to tell the country our truth?"
He heard that "you have power when so many women are powerless".
Fleke pointed out that his office had come up with an opinion, and said by closing the doors that he had come to have more to say about the committee.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee would vote on whether the designation of Kavanaugh would be forwarded to the whole voting Senate.
But Blake said he was willing to do this only if the FBI investigated the complaints against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Fleke was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
Fleke made his decision after having talked to Coons and then several other senators.
The choice of the flag had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses criticism of "political game" around Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play "political games" with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
British State Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom September 29, 2018.
In another interview, printed on her own side on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called ‘Checkers’ plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to obtain tariffs for each other was ‘very late’.
Wayde Sims shooting: The police attack Dytheon Simpson , who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
The police have attacked a man who is suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basket.
The police found the glasses on the site and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After Simpson heard the police say he agreed to shoot and kill Wade.
His causation is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish published an interim report on Friday, where the cause of death is stated as a year of stroke in the head and through neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group on the acquisition of refugees, the State's police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for their contribution to research that led to an attack.
LSU's executive director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for its "hard work and quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the building is "knush" and "in shock" after Wayne's death.
"This is what we fear for any time," said Wade.
Volcanic sprayer shells over Mexico City
The ass spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbourhoods in the capital of Mexico.
Centro Nécional de Preventción de Desastre, Mexico's public crisis prevention unit, warned the Mexican population on Saturday that they had to keep the volcano under control after the crater’s activity and 183 gas and gas emissions were recorded during one day.
The Etate monitored several cases of bleeding and irritation.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash as covered by windmills on cars near Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south of the capital after a earthquake at 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists prior to the annual independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence had a meeting with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic polarisation vote on the resolution.
A group of masked separatists were detained by the opposition police and bombed them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust spots in streets usually filled with tourists.
Hand-mapping also broke out later on the day when the police used ammunition to limit the fighters.
For several hours independence demonstrators were calling 'Never forget, never give up' face to the face of Union demonstrators who called 'Long live Spain'.
Forty people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberated region one year after the referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catholics on 1 October.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority of the motion for a resolution, but it was a bad meeting because the vote was rejected by most who were opposed to the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations in the past, after the police tried to stop the vote that was carried out at electoral stations throughout the region.
Disengagement groups lie in the streets on Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
However, the demonstration was suspended, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had expectations about the possibility of Catalonia to be independent.
"In the past we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to get a vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a small but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties that support Catalan independence have had problems with keeping the pressure up in year after many of their well-known leaders have traveled in self-contained exile or are in custody while awaiting legal action for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The situation becomes more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been in prison for a legal case since late last year, announced that he would be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand for elections as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and rejection of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was drove into a building
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the door and the building itself.
An armchair may also have been removed from the car for a while.
Mengas attack leads to Livingstones 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston secured the race
Livinston exploded Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerard's second losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good encounter from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side has not yet won on the streets of Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, who are eight points before them, next Sunday.
Before this, Ranger's game is to fight home against Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undisputed through six battles in the division. Captain Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livington's going to miss opportunities against his slave guests
Holt's law would have led to long before the score since their direct procedure caused numerous problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but bombed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the park further after breaking in to meet Craig Halkett's head past the target.
The scientist Lotgers played before himself, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at deathball.
And that's how the decisive goal came to.
Rangers gave himself a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga clear paths, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this time Rangers had had seen the ball big all the time, but the defence of the home was seemed unsurpassed and the target guard Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in another half, even though Alfredo Morelos performed a close score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Ranger's keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a short-term match.
Crossings were still in the Livingston box and were still saved, while two punishment requirements – once after Halkett's protest against the replacement of Glenn Middleton – were translated.
«Fenomenal» from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were fantastic all together, and they continued to ignore all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and humanity has recently changed since they came to the top again, but Holt must have a lot of respect for the way he has strengthened it after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organised defence, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at the top throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, had not my inspiration to share with.
Although they have been very good in Gerard for a while, they were unable to live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only came into the road section of the village once – and it was a bit of an awakening for Rangers, which lies in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been a breakdown in such matters as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police identified security as the reason for the fact that a population of 25,000 was not allowed to meet before the mosque, but many of the participants met in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan – many of them Kurts – also heard from themselves, and criticised both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to release him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is healed as a whole by some German Turks and hated as an autocratic by others.
Deptford College: Cycling list killed in a car collision
A cyclone list is killed in a collision like a personal car in London.
The collition took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a travel route to Deptford south of town, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The college will take place only one month after a cyclelist died in a race where the driver slept from the shelter in the Children's Street, about a mile from the sound-day college.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and warn them about it.
Road crossings and bus routes are available, and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured in equipment
Six prison officials are injured in an event by a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Equipped to break off at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still running.
Specialised Tornado officers have been taken in order to manage the event, involving eight inputs and are limited to one flight.
The services were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A number of prison staff said: "Special trained prison personnel are sent in to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the officials will be transferred to the police and may have to spend more time behind the lock and lock."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 intruders, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director received hospital treatment after an intrusion.
And in October last year, the opposition policy was called to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked with billiards.
Orcane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flowers (may be nice for dry areas)
It is the case that Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will probably happen early next week, as the remaining forces of Rosa move through the desert areas in the south and lead to a flood.
National Weather Service has already issued spring warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday and that the government will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "the tropical cyclones have maintained the status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcan until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The latest National Hurcane Center models require 5-10 cm downhill, with up to 15 cm of individual places in Mongolia Rome in Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west forest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get between 2,5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm downhill is possible in some areas.
For those outside the river can be a blessing since the area suffers from drought.
Although flow is a serious problem, some of this sink will probably be favourable, since South-West USA is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Draught Monitor, some 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the next highest category," according to weather.com.
First, the Orcanan Rosa lands in the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has Orcancan strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cold water in the Pacific Ocean and loses its power.
It is therefore expected to meet Mexico with tropical storms Monday evening or afternoon.
The landing of parts of Mexico may be strong and lead to major flooding.
‘The total landings of 7,5–15 cm are expected from Baja California to North-West Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm landings’ according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm to reach the border on Arizona’s gray Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main danger expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very severe decline in Baja California, northern Sonora and the southern United States’, according to the National Hurrine Center.
This landing is expected to produce life-threatening streams and moving Russians and fast in the forest and soil areas.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Killing
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man has been attacked, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The ten-year-old was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was run to the hospital, and his condition must be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was attacked during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who can have mobile phone recordings of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "sounded under weakness and mind" to the democratic party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the careless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump before a referendum in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "sounded under weakness and mind" to the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had begun a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Because it is also evidence of its complaint during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people are so brilliant, smart and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote to support judges Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of our most competent lawyers of our time, with free access to public service," he told a collection of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the vote of the Republicans at the inter-committees.
"We are five weeks apart from one of our most important choices in life.
I am not actually a participant, but I am a participant," he said.
‘That is why I travel around and compete for the best candidates.’
Trump confirmed that the democracies have the aim of "resisting and preventing".
The first interim vote of the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the latest Friday, according to which the Assistant to a Head of the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were taken out into the sea by huge waves that live on the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawasi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves feed the country around sunset, destroy everything in its way, and drop many out of the smoking death.
Tsunami came into the hills on a earthquake of 7.5.
‘As the tsunami broke out yesterday, people still engaged in activities on the beach, didn’t dream immediately and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian member of the crisis management unit (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘Tsunami wasn’t alone – the road with its cars, tramps and houses, it hit everything on the ground,’ said Nugroho, and let it move over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastal line.
Some climb into trees to escape from the tsunami and survive.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management state showed many damaged buildings and shops, damaged and broken bridges and a moske surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rise the coastal town on Saturday.
The calculation of earthquakes could be identified by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's technology assessment and use unit (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power from the vast earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was launched over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, small hole may have made the tsunami larger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘absolute’ and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The likes of some of the victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and let 540 people be injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and damages could be the coast of the larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Doghía, which lies close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely distorted, completely uninformed’ from Dogharaa, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Red Cors in a press release, and let their staff and volunteers be on their way to the border areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
On Saturday the state was strongly criticised for not having been informed that a tsunami had taken Palu, but the authorities said the waves had taken place before the warning was issued.
In an amateur survey on social media, a man in the top stage of a building called desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching pass through the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water will dry up on the beach, and rivers with buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major explosion that prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated have still desperately needed food and other needs.
The city airport is only open for auxiliary work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo shall visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday following the plan.
The deaths after Tsunami in Indonesia increase by over 800.
It's really terrible.
World Vision staff from Dothraa have come safely to the Palu center, where they have been looking for lights during the exhibition at the garden site before their office, but the major damages on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's really terrible.
As aid organisations began to prepare the deeper preparations for the delivery of crisis aid, the complaint was made that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad may not be released into a crisis area before being declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a number of Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Greit, this is a national disaster', we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet become a status."
As the sun goes down over Palu for another time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the deep news image after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little good fish came out of a clock.
On Sunday a woman was released by rescuers after having spent two days in prison under ruins of her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subbandono, the trainer for the national paragliding campaign, had been running two of the missing paraglids for the Asians, which were implemented earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were arrested in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandigi, were also his students.
“As an adult in paragliding, I have my own emotional need to bear,” he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread into the paragliding environment, he was desperate for WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey hacking marks, or more than a couple of blue hacking marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tyver steals USD 26,750 during minibank filling in Newport on the Level
Friday morning stole tens of thousands of USD 26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the maintenance complex and was ready to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run behind the Brink's employee" and stole a money check that was to be delivered.
So many suspects from the scene, according to the press release, have not specified how many were involved in the event.
All who have information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes its name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) had named Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program after she canceled on "emotional basis", according to the serialist.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy radio.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more than a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who've changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously cooperated with the West, has also varied between the use of bond lines and large letters.
Mexico AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
The Acting President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has insisted that he should never use military power against civilians as the country's 50th anniversary of blood-repair against students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "will never use the military to impress the Mexican people".
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the 2nd of October 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing political student movements collapsed across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal acts.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active within artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they use for research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investors and practitioners of artificial intelligence, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with announcements about artificial intelligence, although the United States does not generally have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan in advance and aims to be number 1 within the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big break," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading companies for artificial intelligence, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that won the US's best Othello players, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the US government's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find next generation's heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals academic leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using clock heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a degree of doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically," he said.
The China State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department was established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academics, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
With regard to NSF they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the American legislation aimed at establishing a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in favour of the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether they should change the country's name to the "North-Macedonia Republic" in order to resolve several decades of controversy with Greece, which has blocked their efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province on behalf of Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement on Greek territory and has laid down a veto against including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new ship, but nationalist opponents argue that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has created doubts whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the voting is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU members by adopting the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change in name, including Minister of State Zoran Zaev, argue that it is necessary to pay this price so that Macedonia, a country established after the fall of Yugoslavia, can become a member of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective paraplecy, because it means a secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive because a large number of Members have said they will comply with the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has said that they had not received any irregular reports by 1300.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children – we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian State Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The Macedonian referendum is about to change the country's name in order to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the halls set up by those who were to vote.
"We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we want to be informed with our high head, not be caught in the back road," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
State Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to a sharp investment in Macedonia, which has a employment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says that a "yes" response will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a questionnaire published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of the votes cast on the referendum will be less than the required meeting.
Another study conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of those who responded have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle that the Pro-West Government has supported since it passed in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvers across all Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the Brighton defense in Manchester City 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look slightly light when he scored a target in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received an adjustment at the beginning of the sequence.
He was running around with three Brighton defenses before he got out on the open road.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green horses.
He came around one defense before he walked from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that arrived at Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoulder to hit Brighton's keep Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
«Aguero still has some foot problems» told the city manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
"We talked about he came to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a wake-up pass by the left side of Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling against the longest corner.
Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the network right before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hopeneheim in the Champions League game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spy for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and there is no reason to place strong.
The same competitive Scherzer, however, hopes to stand on the road on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado layer, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 victory over National Friday night, but it's still out after ensuring its first division title.
Although we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the public and the second layer, will be the most likely to be the highest level of competition I can play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting points for Sunday, but must certainly be available to take Scherzer score in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in this case is starting points for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has won 18 matches this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trips People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation around the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of the vote of the Republicans at the inter-elections.
"All we've done is in play in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, great ... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I'm traveling around and shopping for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued «You see this huge, huge group with radical democracies, you see it just now.
And they're determined to take back power at any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass in order to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control we don't have to give them."
Democrats, he said, have the goal of "resisting and preventing".
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, and called the democracies "sense and evil and cruel and unjust".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and mentioned the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the public became loud.
"Do you hear her answer?
Have you played the document?
Um, um, uh.
No, no, I wait one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The work is no longer open to all.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to make me aware of it, it was almost a surprise.
Nevertheless, I am all the last in a number of labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I'd be sent to the elevator because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of having responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe – ironically, quite similar things that Jeremy had inconsistencies with previous leaders.
On Friday's Nottingham East Labor meeting, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on the Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise of 'more, more friendly' policy is too long forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led, when my colleagues previously thought that I shared many political positions with a sudden start to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never agreed on before, either on the security of the nation or on the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and there is nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of strong messages on social media that require me to be rejected, condemn central policy and tell me that I should not be involved in Labor.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know I am happier than any of my colleagues because I receive comments that are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea of sex discrimination and racist comments every day, but they never fail.
One of the most exciting aspects of this political era is how serious exclusion has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every misgivings and every change in the rules of choice will make the party smaller.
I have received many advice during the last two years where I am invited to keep my head low and do not raise the vote so much, because it will "do everything better".
But that is not why I was involved in politics.
Since I was involved in Labor 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the absence of that government, which had led to my classroom at the public school that I had literally said otherwise, I have bought better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillors and government ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may somehow have misunderstood my political positions or differences with the current leadership.
To those presenting the representative's proposal on Friday, I will only say that since the country is taking our way towards a Brexit that will harm private persons, businesses and public services, I cannot take and understand the desire to waste time and strength on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But the message I really want to deliver is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of resignation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best betray their interests.

Year 38 – 17 Melrose: Unsealed Air climbs to tops
Two recent trials have changed the final outcome a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic endurance Tennt's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones missing from the ten.
In the end it was as much their relative defence as their ability to use the possibilities they had received that led to the homemealing of the sailor, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
"We have been challenged in our struggles so far and are still uncertain, so I must be happy with it," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "All honor to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, with a target from Frazier Climo gave Ayr leadership, but a gold card to Scottlandeinen Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, Lot Melrose graduated from the position, and Jason Baggot delivered an experiment without a target.
Climo strengthened Ayrs' management with a criminal park before he, just before the break, the score and the target park, a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 by break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with target from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruarhyh Knott, which was carried out on the bars, and since the beginning Ayr increased the management further further a trial from Stafford McDowell, with a range from Climo.
Ayr's functioning Captain, Blain Macpherson, then got gold card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the road to the full with a trial from Bruce Colvine without target parking, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the homemeal came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card for having taken Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by throwing behind the magnificent Airmill.
Climo served a target park, as he did almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's boxing park and sent branches Gregor Henry picked up for the fifth try of the house.
Set game star ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It appears that Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it was recently found that he was named director of a restaurant company with a discount.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, which he writes for and plays with his long-term comedy partners, Greg Hemphil.
The duen has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning to live after Craiglang.
According to public entries, he is the Director of Apion Morn Limited.
The chess player did not want to comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hint that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country without coastal lines, hopes that the law will open the way to the Pacific Sea
The seamen patrol a rich marine headquarters in La Paz.
The public building has a surrogate flag.
Marine bases from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We are entitled to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
The entire country of Bolivia has still freshly remembered the coastal line they lost in Chile during a bloody conflict of the 1800s, and the country is long after it was able to sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for several decades, with Bolivia waiting for a hearing from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the power to drive, Community hands and senses, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the recognition of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its recognition in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after several decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia’s own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put much emphasis on the recognition of manganese.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The United Nations body, as it has been held in the Netherlands, has no authority to remove Chilean territories and has insisted that it will not resolve the outcome of any negotiations.
That the recognition from the International Court of Justice will only be six months after the last arguments were heard to say that the case was ‘not complicated’ according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may actually have done things worse.
"The problem with access to the sea has been overcome by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has removed any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia at Haag, rejected the theory that the court's decision was inconceivable.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "putting an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties".
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political sculptor.
"Bolivia will never grant its right to access the Pacific," he added.
«Knowledge is a reason to see what we must do in order to overcome the past».
North Korea says nuclear equipment won't happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never undermine its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep their promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments will at the same time appear as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is ready to launch the established nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘desperate dream’ to continue sanctions and American resistance to a declaration that concludes the Korean War will sometimes force North Korea to know.
The US authorities are sceptical to accept the declaration without having Pyongyang first put in place significant decommissioning measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to leave an arsenal country probably sees as their only security guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote exhibitions in Paris reveal the last of the huge headaches, which is on the way to a shop close to you
If you want to have some big additions to your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a selection of special, oversized headplates as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which imposed the motifs on the motéuke in Paris.
Very unprofessional hate has been popular on Instagram in summer, and these designers have sent down their catwalking creatures.
Valentino’s most eye-catching plague was an overcrowded leg that had painted with a flierlike wide chest that drew the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included yellow-bred watermelons, a trolley hat or even ananas, but are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of cheaper masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had cross-referenced lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than last scream.
One creature remembered the cover equipment, including snorkel and cover glasses, while the other looked like a frozen ice cream in the kitchen.
And if you're out after even greater resistance, then you're lucky.
Stylers assume that the huge hats can be on their way towards a shop close to you.
The oversized hats come right into the corners of ‘La Bomba’, the beam hat with a half-metre wide bridge that has been seen on all and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind the very inflexible hat as dominated social media has now sent another great creature down the catwalk – a beach pool in a stream that is almost as large as the bath-drawn model that carries it.
The orange refinery, which is bordered with refineries and complemented with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the museum in Paris.
Journalist Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shopping malls next summer – when the designer has such an impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for citizens of the world
Scotland's fresh schools continue to show academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with some one year's excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free Schools Council), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to provide the best school experience for both students and parents.
The goal is to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a step-by-step school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanding choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands when his words are his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, when his words are in your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just keep ourselves in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the year's examination, we see that language is above the table with the highest percentages of composition from new schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received exam A.
The data obtained from 74 of the Free Schools Council showed that 72 per cent of students received the test A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that new schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people will obviously need in the future.
Languages as experts are now valued at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the level of fresh schools and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons of employment problems, 17 per cent could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
Each time more and more jobs require language skills these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov study of more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit number of participants (15 per cent).
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today's children.
Learning more languages, especially those related to growing economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages considered most valuable to Britain on the road towards 2020, e.g. Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of language to choose between new schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scotch schools are aimed at creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may bring.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial to the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Friscoles will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron will have his Lakers detour on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match of Sunday's opening match against Denver Nuggetts in San Diego.
The number of minutes he will play is still not determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise this week, James was asked what plans he had for Laker's six-player driving plan.
"I don't need to drive camps at this stage of my career," he answered.
Time for the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
The President will launch a series of elections in the evening Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned censuses during the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his elected high-level candidate has been put to wait, Trump aims to obtain support for the next mid-elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the voters go to the voter in November.
When is the Trump West Virginia folk meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trips People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19:00 ET in the evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings of the week for the Supreme Court of the Kavanaugh, who has been charged with sexual abuse. A anticipated confirmation vote has been put to wait for up to one week while the FBI is investigating the matter.
The main objective of all these public meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging choice in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five referendums over the next few weeks are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and support players by trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Convention control is so crucial for his agenda that the President will travel to as many sub-states as possible while we are moving towards a travel campaign song," Reuters was heard by a campaign person for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract support players from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month of Trump has visited West Virginia, a sub-state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is based on the criteria.
"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to the measles," said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the fight to keep the faith as they enter the Sunday's single game
After three consecutive sessions on Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed for the year.
The moving pendulum of the moment is a fully-discovered concept of sport, but however, some players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They led with six points and now it's four, so we carry it well with us as a moment," Jordan Spieth said when he left the road for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead with four points and it is 12 again to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel they've got some wind in the islands again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has provided outstanding games from tea to green, and leads for example.
The deep air raids were higher after each as the round continued, and descended to a decisive punctuation to raise the match to the ground when he and Thomas were under two.
His punctuation, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – by the sort that shows that he still doesn't think the American layer is hopeless.
"We really just have to put all the balls together and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is obviously Ryder Cups big success story.
Europe's unusual but beautiful pair has four of them and does not make a foot mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine days of Friday morning.
These results and how their energy looks to move both to and from the living population make it clear that they are the biggest competitors of the Sunday, and there are no other players in the audience will also see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freewood or Molinari.
All at least two at the same time, in each of its own hell.
However, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got up easily with Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's four-ball hero, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two double during the first nine geese left the Spanish and Swedish so far behind that they did not have the nubbesian to take the lead again.
But on Sunday there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn for a moment.
Europe has played better than it has played so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the team USA has a single fighter, especially in the United States, has failed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong momentum at the beginning of Ryder Cups last day, after having completed the Sunday's four-ball and four-some-square matches with 10-6 management against the United States.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two rowers against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, which is fighting to keep the trophies they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's four-balls and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't have to take any more of the lead.
Jim Furyks' side must get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European rocket that has received four points on row, and he and Molinari – who together have received the name "Mollivod" after a centenary weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they worked together to beat down Woods and the American Rokey Bryson Dechambeau with another more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stood through two matches on Saturday, smiled at the inside, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, assigned to the four-ball tomorrow, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and served a 2&1-winner against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is organized as number one and three on a global basis.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this hot day with a light bridge south of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-deposited 2&1 sailor over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and later came back to kill Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two geunas.
Only two times in Ryder Cups history has a layer ready to enter after a firepoint start at the beginning of the single game, but as the current holder only needs Furyks' side to get undefeated in order to keep the trophie.
But after having been the best for two days, it doesn't seem like they'll be able to deliver a response on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘not in any way’ join one another without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to strengthen the mystery of the United States and that the country would not go on a unilateral release of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented "significant welfare measures" in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, detonating the nuclear testing area and by prohibiting the spread of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we haven't seen any similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not give up on each other first."
Ri again welcomed North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for the gradual downturn, but his statement was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on 12 June, during the first meeting between a situate president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim was committed to working against the ‘Atomnage of Korea’ while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has claimed a formal end of the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also faced calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘Atomnage first’ and has been pressureed through sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and resists even the 'declaration of the end of the war’, according to Ri.
“The fact that sanctions can force us into knowing is a dream of wish for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for another encounter between Kim and Trump as the US leader stressed earlier this week before the UN.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the last five months and added: "If the other party in this dispute were South Korea, or the United States, the nuclear equipment would not have been as determined as it is."
However, the tone for the Russian speech was very different from that of the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on stability-USA with North Korea rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Bade President" Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea last year, Tromp this year before the UN and Russian Kim to be brave enough to take the downturn, but said that many work still remains, and the sanctions must remain applicable to North Korea's nuclear equipment.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said, "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced in force and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to undermine the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sides of the UN General Assembly, and said he wanted to visit Pyongyang again the next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but the last trip wasn't going well.
He resigned from Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after the North Korea accused him of having come with "gang-active demands".
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month to lower a missile zone and a nuclear-weapon-free facility if the United States had taken "the same measures".
He said Kim had said that these "comparative measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get some rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by talking about the growing culture by enjoying through the night with coffee drinks like fuel.
A academic found that students at the world’s best universities often didn’t have to worry about how they would take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after holding a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the talk a girl came to me and said, "Why didn't no one say this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains how important it is with good sleep habits to be able to perform academically and sportingally and for the public.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part it is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, gardens, yogges and books and hear about the effects of coffee and light and how sports performance is affected by sleeplessness and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons allows participants to think about their own daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, as well as you have the right to know about the risk by smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to smoke all night, he said, and let modern technology and the growing pressure on the students led to a growing problem of sleeplessness.
Enough sleep should be the “secret weapon” of the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleeplessness puts the brain in salt mode, which leads to constant cold sensation.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the teacher in four, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alert when they were to stand up as well as when they were to stand up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED light. This type of light can interfere with daily movement and lead to sleep deprivation.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Target of Menga Kills Gerard's Men
Ranger's track is probably a drawback when Dolly Mengas aims to break Steven Gerard's team 1-0 at Livingstone.
Ibrox side wanted his first victory since February 4–1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law caused Gerard's second losses on 18 matches as manager and then his eight points from the Ladbroke Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Several slots for seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to figure out.
Rangers now fall into six places, while Livingston climbs up to three and is behind Hibernia at different destinations.
It may be more injurious for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after an item was cast from the outside audience.
Gerard made eight shifts on the floor, like the party passed by Air and entered the Betfred Cup terminals.
On the contrary went for the same Livi 11 which took a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy about how his well-bred leg broke the resistance.
Rangers may have most possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes in the game when Mengas first match sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goals, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long break by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if the game they were going to slow down on hope rather than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a criminal park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collated, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
Ranger's only two shots at targets for the first time, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and an empty park from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening in 34 minutes may have been against the game's start, no one can refuse to deserve it for the effort.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player gave immediate results when the player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston was able to get the remote players to play exactly that kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have narrowed the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton may have had a late requirement on the penal park as he landed in conflict with Jacobs, but again he saw Thomson gone.
Almanacs: Founder of Gegariters
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the generator.
The geologist has been an important part of science since then, and has also been part of popular culture through the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerator. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms of radioactivity in the minerals.’
Evans: "Let's say it makes sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery he gave his name is still alive.
The new vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
The new vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immunities from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can reach ‘see’ a protein that is common in many forms of cancer and is then injected into the patient again
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that her ovarian strength was due to decay for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immunities from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typical of many forms of cancer, and then inject these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda in Maryland said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘Driver growth of different types of cancer’ includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, which was taken from the patient and "trained" to respond to cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was conducted in a study on Saturday Night Live after a famous event in which he legalized US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to vote in 2020.
After singing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, introduced a Make America Great Again-hatt, he went out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How can you be like Trump, he's racist?"
If I were saved from racism, I had moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star approached Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment complaints made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't circled, West was caught up in social media by comers Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to let the West down by adding the record.
West also complained to the public that he had heard it on the backroom about the choice of headaches.
"But the mobile.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
But you're moving!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me see what the reality is?" he said, and he said, "Take me Supermann's hat, because then no one can say what I'm going to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.»
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL so smoothly reported Variety, who one member said: "The whole studio was killed."
West was introduced as the last little substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of our bravest: Thank you for your great IMOT MASSENE."
But talkshowd by Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "because he is and it's totally fantastic".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") which I mean culture and ask for ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
It's us too," she added.
Before show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said from now on he "was officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow now in the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Rapper Collegiate Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lion. It is of course the deceased musical Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
The purpose of the killing test after knife arrest at the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been targeted for attempted murder after being kidnapped at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
It happened in Ballyhackmore, according to the police.
Target is expected to be produced for Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The view will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Longer Against "Gift masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role played by the heavy winner Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy to the middle age, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old chess player has gone out and criticised the stereotype of the machohelt and says such roles in movies are often given to young men to believe they must be empty to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said something has gone wrong and confused about how to attack the problem with "fever masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, recently married to Game of Thrones' colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, refused to be very involved in the subject.
"It worries me quite much about the time – where did it go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we hired men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "masculinity" due to the strong male roles.
He continued: "What is born and is delivered?
What is mediated on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young guys feel they have to grow right this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any progress or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series is closed next summer, and says he is "complete with battle marks and horses".
From November, Kit will play the main role in a new game of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a dancer.
The shooter recently discovered that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the shootings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kits role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy Prize-Privacy fantasy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are covered in the country, says a health representative.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which marks a change from previous times.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of persons getting hives in this way is now closer to zero, said a Chinese health staff at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, over the years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men after each marry women.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have ruled on public access to HIV as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to co-operate data about Republican senators, exploits "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the complaint on Saturday that members of her staff had posted the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles secured by the claims was presented by ultraconservative commentators and web pages.
"Lows, lies and more rejected lies," Waters said in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network Thursday, issued by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the appeal charges against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The play came a little after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the installation was traced to the Waters office and disclosed information about a member of Water's staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded complaint is completely incorrect and a legal lie’ continued Waters.
‘Members of my staff - who have received their identity, personal data and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false complaints - had absolutely no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded complaint is completely incorrect and a legal lie.’
Water's opinion was quickly criticised on the network, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This blessing is aggressive," wrote Fleisher.
‘This means that she does not have the right to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be aggressive.
They don't have to go to defense.
They must not question the reasons for the complaint.
They must act calmly and with restraint.’
Fleisher compared Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during the hearing of the Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters from the mid-elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
‘Stort – if it is true’ he tweeted.
In its opinion, Waters said that her office had warned "relevant authorities and police about these false charges".
"We will make sure that the manufacturing personnel are destroyed," she continued, "and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff."
Registration of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodless Rowan Atkinson in Spion Paradodi
It has now become a tradition to look after Brexit's inventions in all new films with a British look and it seems to be relevant for this resurgence of parodyfranchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would Sarkastic self-satisfied about how openly we are becoming the new export product of the nation?
In any case, the competent Johnny English with his blind eye and the gumy attitude has been renewed to redefine it for another time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema.
He is of course the bold secret agent who despite his rather James Bond ambitions is a mixture of Clouseau, a dész Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the musical entry with the theme of fire during the opening ceremony at OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the most long forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mysteryman who leaves chaos everywhere.
It's one great moment in the latest Johnny English era.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medium age equipment, and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but the Humor feels quite bloody and highly excessive, especially now that the "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible distance are included on comedy.
Humor seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fashions are not as exciting and eaten as the stem movies in Mr. Bean.
The current estimate is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super secret web network of spies and uncovered the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the operation of the surveillance agent – an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last blow for a minister of state, a pump and reduced figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political non-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this as well as the Teresa May role, but the manual does not give her much to work with.
The Board of Directors informs her that since each active spy has been dissolved, she must bring in one of the pensioners.
And it means the cloned Johnny English, who now works teaching on a snobbed institution, but gives unofficial teaching in secret. There are some sort of sequences here when English offers a rock Academy for spy activity.
English will be rushed back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and back with its old, sick assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, surrounded by an unsub-computer, a hysterical overclassed role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little discarded.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotating everything to the queen's orders are back, where they face Olga Kurylenko's great five deaths, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the State Minister is led by the charismatic technology milliard who claims to be able to solve British cyber problems: the bright Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with farce-active fronts: dressed as servers put the guys at a charming French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board in Voltas lullusuyacht; and English dissolves the clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All stop places are really drawn out before the last sequence, but still so cute and shocking it is so much to remember about children's TV with all kinds of grass.
Go on average, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films I could only think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets his talent?
Labour expects them to develop plans to let the British work four-day work, but to pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party shall assess a radical plan that will give the British four-day job search – but pay for five.
The Party will be likely to use savings on the revolution by providing workers with extra Sundays.
This will result in a three-day salary, while they will be paid the same wage.
Source says that the idea enters into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day sugar so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen at night, but Thursday's smoke is an ambitious ambition that matches the party's wish to make the pendulum shift to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party's overall industrial strategy’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party won the four-day match during the campaign before Parliament's election in 2017.
However, the tank is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A speaker for Labor said: "A Thursday's visit is not the party's policy, and it is not something that will be evaluated by the party".
Financial speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to expand his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from ‘invisible directors’ and ‘professors’ of public service providers.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not returning the entire stock item because a Labour Government may carry out ‘retribution’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in company management and to set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity to private sector companies to employees with an annual salary of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI bordering of Kavanaugh can get them to change their mind
The FBI bordering the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has raised a final vote on his appointment to the High Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's findings may have some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about what would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, firm, sure, conscious.’
However, Graham's voice appears to be in the rock.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must be an optimistic finding”, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know one thing: Board beat it energy," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them could confirm it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to take place and a similar impressive mission; to eradicate the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now within its seventh year, will be given to thousands of people to contribute to the great crowd in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness about the actual objective of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to get the free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to carry out a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, email messages to a world leader, telephone or other meaningful ways of increasing awareness about their objective of eradicating poverty.
But how lucky has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years back to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way of getting people to fight for changes, or just a case of so-called "clickivism" - that people feel a great deal about them by signing a signing campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 19 million "actions" since 2011, with a range of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and notices as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that the secure funding has been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom to "help children take advantage of their full potential", and agreed to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to eradicating the country’s error after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Cities.
‘With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Cities like you, we can make social injustice under-renewable to a footnote in history’, told Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the population during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom for better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
As an answer to one of the common questions on the website "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and difficult way – inseparably we will fall and fall.
But like the important civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is one of the artists who will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the sea as a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may ‘if necessary’ point to the sea in order to prevent Russian energy when markets, inter alia in the Middle East, were opened by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria – especially when they operate on an invitation from the legal government – is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the number person, there are always ways and means to handle this.
"The US has the ability to ensure that the seas are open and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that the energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinkke spoke to the participants on the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that defines itself as ‘the voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far along the way.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel’ he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The opinions came to the conclusion that the Trump administration had been on a course to strengthen exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they wanted to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
The staff of the Trump administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European Gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin ‘incapacitated’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's sly resistance to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's lead industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to refrain from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have serious problems with third countries that are involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" on his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" if she would make a presidential candidate after the mid-election.
At an election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was going to sit.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and get the dirty government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I am to be appointed as President's candidate".
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his highest legal candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI hearing before the vote".
However, an opinion published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think it should be set up in 2020.
58% of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not sit down, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her application.
The measurement showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidate in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
When he said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election
Track Palin, 26, was a year after he got married in September.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence last night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he has come home, I have together with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers," she told the public at an electoral organization for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of the son and other war veterans: "They're coming home a little different, they're coming home here, they're coming home and wondering if this is the respect of their military cameras and their pilots and all the other members of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the purpose of violence in the home of a woman, closed with a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was beaten, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 Sub-States and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
The Act of the Sub-States and District of Colombia supports a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum for victims fleeing from violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 sub-States and D.C. presented a guidance from a friend of the law in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The whole name of the case in Grace v. Sessions case which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent rival sons" abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as countries with major problems with genes and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeal of immigrants who granted undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
In an opinion on Friday, Mr Karl Racine in the District of Colombia said that the new policy "has gone away from many decades of state, federal and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be resolved from the specific facts and circumstances of the claim and such a prohibition conflicts with the principle’ said the orientation of amius curiae.
Lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused to access immigrants would damage the US economy and say it is very likely that they will be founded and "contributing with the necessary labour force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing from home violence and hostility in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion’ said the Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on policy.
Asyl never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people meet every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – death rates double in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very exciting," says the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she comforts her febesy son at an evacuation centre in the combined city of Palu.
"All the time you see ambulances coming around.
Pure water is scarce.’
You could see the inhabitants who came home destroyed and easily passed through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of thousands of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had a force of 7.5, were filled.
Some of the injuries, among others Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the debtor, are outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of ongoing severe suspicion.
He gets tears in his eyes when he tells about how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in fifth grade he shared with his wife and daughters.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was blinded by the wall that broke up together, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was settled.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador blames China for “tracing” with “propagandised ads”
A week after a public Chinese newspaper announced a fireman's announcement in an American newspaper that reflected the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. Ambassador of China Beijing accused the US press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex to China Daily to appear in the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after having accused China of trying to join the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge China rejects.
Trump's complaint that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. election, marked a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said Reuters.
It is true that foreign authorities usually use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked up in an escaling trade war which has led to new customs duties on imports of each other.
In the early years of the trade war, Chinese and US experts reported that exporting companies such as Iowa, supported by the Trump Republic Party, were to be established.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of America in China and former multi-year governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has framed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Burnstad wrote in a lecturer in the Des Moines Register of Sunday: "No one is going to stop the tracking by making advertising ads in our own free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities use the freedom of expression and the open press we use in America to introduce a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the aviskiosket on the street here in Beijing, you do not find many misleading views and may not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people about China’s problem economic course, given that the media are under the threshold of the Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added: "One of China's biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, even if he did not tell what it was.
Republicans screen off female voters before the mid-election with the Kavanaugh Father, warning analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest-law candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several complaints of sexual abuse against themselves, warn analysts that they will receive a response, especially from women, in the future local elections.
The feelings about this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already shown their desire to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a FBI survey in the last second would be enough to offend his voters.
"Women will not forget the events of tomorrow – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, an senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, "November is coming!" while in the Senate, the Republicans who controlled the judicial committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are about to explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among women who are uncertain voters in the cities and young people who choose between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they are appointed by the President.’
Even before Ford’s public testimony that gave detailed description of the complaints of sexual abuse against the high-rights candidate, analysts thought it would be an act of opposition if the Republicans were forced through the nomination.
‘This has become a sell-off for the Republican Party’ said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republic National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inserted – it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be a fraction of whom they must believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witness explanations, with a small majority for the benefit of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of the questions were fully or thoroughly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or quite convinced about Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38 % said they were quite convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under his target, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the release from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s claims in addition to at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee during the last two weeks that Kavanaugh was in a state of disrepute when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the highest legal candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at the time of the study at Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a launch that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological project, Inrupt, is a company that further builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
In Solid, users can choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee pointed out that the purpose is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment".
The app uses the technology for Solid to allow people to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, working lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data storage online is that it is up to the user to have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation via data’.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should set up resources, processes and relevant competences to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some initial developers on the contract to work with the project and a lot of volunteers.
From this week on, technology can develop around the world to create its own decentralised app through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to «Facebook and Google about whether or not they will introduce something completely new or not, something that will make their business models completely rehabilitated over the night.

Bernard Water: celebration of Victorian recipients from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was assigned a Victorian during World War I was celebrated in his home after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honor certificate on September 29, 1918 at the battle in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never informed that he had been assigned the highest British military rank.
A monument was discovered by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his childhood children, Michael Vann, said it was a "floating symbol" in which the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the master’s price was paid.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29th – “through very thick clouds and under strong protection from field cannons and machinery devices”.
Later he directed against the shooting line and led the line "with great against" forward before he stormed a field cannon itself and pulled out three of the divisions.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me feel better".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dropped a crane after the parade, which was led by the Corpsy Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said: "It felt very honored to play a role in the parade", and added: "The loss of a real life is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA accessories were up all night to see the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa grey.
Make sure you've been awake all night to see the tight-packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose was cleared through 13 camps, where there were six on the main map and was shown directly through the night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the eyes in Britain were seated to measure when the picture suddenly showed Peppa grey.
Some were less imponent after keeping awake early in the morning to see the fight.
A adapter described on Twitter the transition to the child programme as "a kind of sick shock".
‘It is State regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00, so that they should be submitted to children’s programmes,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about the consignment.
"Beppa grey, yes!"
Bellator's managing director, Scott Cooker, said they're going to work with the shipping plan to include the sights in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out with a view to the fight," said Coker.
"But it's at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe it -- when we put it over, many messages went back and out, and they weren't exactly the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce from six to five – which we usually send – and we're trying to extend ourselves far beyond the trailers, but the tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sex
Olympic treader Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before he found out that "he wasn't like anyone else".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homofiles to give other "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned about winning the OL.
The usual programme leader of the traditional state programme, Kirsty Young, shall be removed for a few months due to disease.
Daley began as a little off on Lavern's first mission and said he felt "lower worth" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to be equal to both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day these feelings of inferiority and otherwise have been the real motivation and I have the power and the power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he "was something," he said, so he didn't despair when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He has twice won a bronze in OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in the Australian Year of Society to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels happy that he can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The third time the world teacher said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's friend, who is 20 years older than he, four years old, but he said the difference of age had never been a problem.
"When you pass so much in such a young age," he participated in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was necessary to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me earlier, I wondered if I just had to win a gold medal,” he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medallion in OL.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked if they had got tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he didn't want to live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
“I kept his hands when he stopped washing, and it was not before he actually finished washing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not uncompromising”, he said.
The year after Daley competed in the OL 2012 and won the prize.
“I knew only that it was what I had dreamed of for the rest of my life – to walk before a local audience under OL, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first collection - Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the race before OL and which still gives him gas skin.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's form was taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will kill a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th. Ryder Cup match, but he has to come in if it's not to be a sad mileage.
Mickelson, who played in the 12th-time bienary, was put on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk before the day-to-day Fourball and Foursome Camps.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five times the Major-Vintor divides the day between being a hero and working with his game at the rank in hopes of fixing it as a shock.
The 48-year-old had never had the best swing, even at the top of the career and is not in perfect form for the narrow Le Golf National Road, where the long rough area still penalizes the wildfire.
And if the path itself isn't shocking enough, meet Mickelson, in the ninth battle on Sunday, the only British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the matches of their age.
If the Americans, with four points below the 12 single games, get a good start, Mickelson's game can prove to be very decisive.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband that he could not say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stick on my back and let the arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has great self-confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these layers earlier, and this week.
I don't think I'd see him playing two games.
I see more for me, but that's how it ended up, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will kill Nick Faldos record for most played Ryder Cup camps on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 series, 20 losses and seven outstanding, but Furyk said his participation introduced some intangible values to the layer.
"He's soft, sardistic, smart and like to play sex with others. He's a great guy to have in the bedroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players were pleased to try against him this week too, and it was worth seeing.
He gives more than just the game."
European legislator Thomas Björn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European Law Commissioner, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the launch of the last day's solo game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant circle.
The dance started in the 1997 fight at Valderram, where a side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the race to the race with the minimum possible margin, 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You still remember that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderram, where we won, but only so," said Björn, photographed after having seen Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the layer that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over before you get the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophie, and that's where the focus is.
I've been saying all the time that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golf games in the world.”
The baby is very pleased with how his players have made themselves available on the empty golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performances in the center, and there's something else else.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances that play golf will be tested to the full.
It's the message you have to tell the players that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Børn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to deliver better individually than the partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major translations of the last day. He was on the winning stage at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed "Midnah's miracle".
I remember every sentence of it," he replied in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the lawman in 1999, had fought with his players at the beginning of the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, as we experienced at Brooklyn, which we saw at Medinah.
When the moment begins to go in one direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle of the games.
We arrange our settings then and send the people out in the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
"I put on this group of men in that order because I think it's the whole way," said Børn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship has been delayed enough once
The newest cargo in Germany would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the so-called war, but it will not happen sooner than next year because of failing systems and gallopering costs, local media reported.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the ship of the whole new cargoes in the Baden-Wuertemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit as a military figure.
The ship would have been delivered by the sea in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuertemberg class were ordered back in 2007, will replace the old cargoes in the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they shall be equipped with a strong cannon, a number of anti-air protection and anti-shipment missions and some steelth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest requests for up to two years away from home.
However, slow delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany the strength at sea – will already be updated before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The shipyard F125 frigate created headlines in four, when the German marines officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the firm Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the sea has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of important "software and hardware defects" which made the warship unusable in a campaign.
The software effects were particularly important since the ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class is to be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew on older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge weight, which reduces performance and limits the ability of the sea to make future upgrades.
The 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price gap on the whole project – including human training – has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new fleets are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's maritime forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, confirmed that the sea "is empty for applicable ships".
The ambassador said that the problem had been scaled over time because old ships were being constructed, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the cargoes in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the sea.
National Trust Doubles on the Secret Life of Flag Museums
A new research carried out by a country estate in the Scottish Highland shall find out how flaggermus uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flagermus and dvergflaggermus as well as the springman and water flaggermus at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special holders will be placed at important locations around the property to track the flager motivities during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using hand-held detectors.
The expert's sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag-murpens and the types that do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural protection adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the Flag Mouse and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of beet fields and how best to be used in the forest for flaggermus and other associated species.
The Flagmermus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has died considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects dwelling and housing.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as flow paper and certain chemically treated construction materials as well as attacks from memory.
Flaggermus is not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunts, they have more use for the ears than for the eyes when it comes to catching shifts.
They use advanced ecocalization to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
NTSC, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important hectares and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes Flaggermus very seriously.
They have ten competent experts carrying out regular studies, mapping of angles and inter-stellar rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only flagship reserve at the Treve landscape of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten flag musarts of Scotland.
Owner David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Thrave we have a perfect area for flaggermus," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there is still much we don't know about flaggermus, so the work we do here and with other properties will help us understand more about what they need to do."
He underlines the importance of mapping the flag muscles before maintenance of an asset since the sudden destruction of one single angle may kill up to 400 dogs and young people, and perhaps expel a whole local population.
Flaggermus is protected and it is illegal to kill them, trace them or disturb them or destroy their angles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish co-worker for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to help in the work.
She says: "We still have much to learn about our flag museums, and too many species we don't know exactly how the populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of violence while lawyers are investigating the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has described the allegations of violence as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to investigate German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is charged to pay her $375 000 in advance for keeping close to the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers followed a few hours after the complaints were reported, 33 years old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times winning from the Goldballen into the camera.
"They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and I'm good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronald Dos' lawyers are prepared to investigate Der Spiegel because of the claims they have called ‘a unacceptable production of suspects in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “constitutional damage to an extent equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of the protection of persons in recent years”.
The event claimed to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player's room, where he is supposed to have raped her annum, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good man" who had failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she added the differences outside the court because she was "serious for punishment" and was also concerned about "public dependence".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put prejudice on the side because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged seizure, and moved this summer to the Italian Youth on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom’s “Everlasting Care” on the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom 'will take care of it forever' if they lose the status of the world's leading car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was " Worryful" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossings at any Brexit without agreement could mean less jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150 000 cars in four, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotas at Burnaston.
Other British producers have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers say supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘command as needed’ and it reaches parts of every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for the car’s order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may remain at the border, something that industry says can lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's storage at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit’s EU-related plan is ‘precisely designed to avoid such border controls’.
"We must have an agreement. We want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only able to enjoy success right now, but also to take this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "My experience says that when these jobs are gone, they will never come back."
A number of people from the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed, says the White House
Donald Trump's board meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be "extended for a week" while the fight around High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia, as well as possible obstacles to the exercise of justice by the President.
The question of Trump will be rejected by the Minister of Justice or not, and therefore threatening Mueller's independence, has been raised during the Washington speculations for several months.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of opening the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th floor.
Rosenstein quoted the information.
But last month he returned to the White House, while it was announced that he was about to leave voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, would be held on Thursday.
Trump said "most likely to let go" to shoot Rosenstein, but then he was challenged to avoid collating with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a FBI investigation for one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further raised a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's delay because of everything that happens with high rights.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will contest the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programmed Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the tendency against TV reporters 'self-interest', even though she added: 'I am not in agreement with the fact that they are self-good'.
Then she indicated that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
"The President is making more questions than any previous president," she said and added without giving evidence: "We have seen the figures"
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly questions, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We are trying to get it back often, and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks, and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open facilities or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible reason why he conducted a solo race and had in time a remarkable behavior in front of a number of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written at the EU level working in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and a wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain would leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal have taken place during the summer and are expected to take place on a solution to the autumn.
However, the British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I think this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the group, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and abroad, deliver valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service for the best patients and the local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and we hope that you will be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes rapid surgery after head injury
Defenders at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a rapid operation after having suffered a head injury during the 31-27 day of the hearing day to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the newspaper Tennessean.
Tennesse's Head of State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage was similar before the first shift was over.
"He came out on the sideline, and just hang out there," Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘there is no information on the type/scale of the damage yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transition from Illinois.
He had five thanks on Saturday before he finished the fight, something that gives in all 18 thanks for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy an asset in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in Britain. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The change will neutralise the success of Corby's plan to attract young voters
The documentation fee will be received from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Experts in the Finance Department expect it to increase to 120 million pounds a year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in Britain – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with promise to offer more reasonable housing and high-income groups.
The dossier tax will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The extra money will strengthen the government's measures to remedy the situation of homeless people.
The surplus — which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and rent purchases — may be as much as 3 %.
The Department of Finance expects the measure to amount to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which raises prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot within the housing market.
Many well-being areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ‘city’ because of the many foreign purchases most of the country’s residents.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson has come up with proposals for a reduction in document tax to help several young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies to keep housing prices high by buying up countries without using them, and demanded Theresa May to reject quotas on reasonable housing in order to solve the British 'moral housing policy'.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an ambitious series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unreasonably drafts.
He also wants to give municipalities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: "In the past I said I would like to spend my time as a minister of state to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as simple for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard to work for British citizens.
For so many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too remote, and the unwarranted situation of the homeless remains."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead Scotland"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become the manager of Scotland before or after.
The 42-year-old shot rejoices at the challenge of restoring the club in the north-east, which currently holds third place in League One, three points under the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I liked to play for my country as football players.
I got a B-caps and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I was often with my father and then Scotland on Hampden as a child, and it's always something that pulls me back.
However, that option would only come if I succeeded in the club.’
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not reluctant to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected relations between Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Successes for me will be measured at the moment if I can get the club back to the Premier League’.
From the structure and facilities of this club, they are of course the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just think of myself to be lit here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month-old short-acting in Hearts' train station.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the drop to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the bottom of the drop to win the master title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
‘It was probably an adequate difference’ he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought that management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds very good since I did it, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be boring.
There's a lot of things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it with stress and pressure in the job, but management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I've ever known in my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on hearing days, showing study
The summer’s heat wave has strengthened the revenues of the British hard-pressed pubs, but let more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced a 2,7 % market survey in July – while the income for restaurants fell by 4,8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “The continued solar eclipse and the unexpected long participation of England in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as last month June when the pubs went up 2.8%, except for restaurants were even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant set in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the best result, but an increase that was more like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Puber with food was also difficult with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the Raston drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pipes and bars the turnover increased by 6.6 % per month, with food storage decreased by 3 %.’
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant company RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The environment and large sports and social events are still the most important factors in the marketing of the external market.
It will not be surprising that restaurant groups continue to have difficulty, and a 4,8 % annual-on-year turnover will be particularly painful at the top of the current cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food business, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a long-term dust space".
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including innovations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the rise in new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of the five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, showing research
A study of 20 000 young students revealed pages with "fake Insta".
The news has increased the concerns of sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘main account’ they show their parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden for adults.
A study of 20 000 young students found rapid growth in the ‘fake Insta’ accounts – a reference to Instagram image-pages.
The news has increased the concerns of sharing sexual content.
20 % of students said they had an innocent "main account" as they refer to their parents while having other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “blow me.”
The research carried out by the Digital Awarenes UK and the Conference of Rectors (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles and half of them agreed to have secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is shocking that so many young people are being tempted to create sites where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilyh Doyle will be the voice of the "frequencyists" in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has an unexplained role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated holiday exerciser, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the right to be informed of its extensive experiences in international navigation over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide peace-rights environment, and we are sure that peace-righters in Scotland will benefit from getting it into control," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to work as a voice for peacekeepers, and I hope that I have much to do to guide the law in Scotland".

Brochure pump advertisements comparing mothers with cars sharing the opinion of the network
A breast pump company has broken the opinion of the network with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pumps that are brought close to the body", Elvie, the technologically-based consumer company, a fresh and flowing music video-enforced adverts to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real moms dance in a low-full of high and curve to a song with, among other things, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any hall" and "In case you didn't find it, it's not a animal, it's my puppies".
Koret continues: "Pum it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my balls."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the lakes, many say it reflects the 'grossities' in the meridian industry.
‘The bad decision to use cows to announce this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies will be taken from them a few days after birth,” was one who wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "For a failed ad."
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is "untrustable mother".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd have had one if I was still an orphan.
The pumping got me to feel like a cow.
The ad's a little dirty, but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product," it was one that wrote.
Another commented: "This is a mother-in-law ad directed towards mothers such as pumps (often on the workplace or toilets) and feels like "curs".
This is not an ad that conceals or condemns meridian bronchis.’
At the end of the video, the women discover that they all have the dance with the discreet pump in the b-en.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cars.
However, the Elvie pump is quite stylish, there are no leads or snakes and get a nice place in an amme-bé, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while the pumps.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a slow and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and liquefied women, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while we demonstrated in a sustainable and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week a doll came up on the catwalk for designers Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tentmaker at the Texas border in all secrets
The number of migrant children detained has increased even if the monthly border crossing has been relatively stable, partly because the difficult rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most support players themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been saved to ruin their own chances of being in the country by putting forward and making demands on a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior minister at the immigration and customs offices, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested thousands of people who were seeking support for individual minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had not previously had criminal rolls.
‘Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either support players or members of the household of support players are illegal in the country and most of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to follow these people," says Albence.
The officials are trying to manage the children faster and introduced new rules that ensure that some of them must meet in court within one month after being detained, and not 60 days after the previous standard, according to recipients.
Many will be produced through a video conference instead of meeting personally to conduct their case on a residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of their suffering or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or dreaming, according to recipients and reports that have occurred in the last few months of the system.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are more vulnerable are subjected to the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the countmaster without having enough time to prepare emotionally or take care of friends can strengthen dreams that many already have.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish "occupational powers" to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouelem also called for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country's war is now within its eighth year.
Moulalem, also acting as a visa minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the control of combating terrorism and "will be treated there".
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,’ he said to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions are refugees.
He said that Damascus will continue to "take this sacred struggle to clean all Syrian territories" for terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-contained country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return and he accused "some Western countries" of "prone of irradiation" which would allow the refugees to stay away.
"We have referred to the international community and humanitarian organisations to organize these returns," he said.
They policy what is really a purely humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that support for the reconstruction of Syria will not come before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the opposition by Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkey Agreement has rejected a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against Jihadists, including warmen from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who ‘will be eliminated’.
UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he may invite the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to develop a post-war law for Syria and the road to new elections.
Moualem presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian authorities in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted to ‘examination of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win a period of
According to the logic, Trump would have won the reelection in 2020, with less, as many liberals have probably won hopes of, rich rights and scandals that would end the presidency before that time.
In what would obviously be "the most dramatic conclusion of a Presidency ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign of seriality.
Since 2014, the number of seats for the best sent time has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million watches in the best sent time, up from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC «The Rachel Maddow Show» has raised the number of cable sets with a total of 3.5 million watches on evenings with large news cases.
"This is a fire that people are attracted by because we don't feel anything," said Neal Baer, programme leader of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an acknowledged comedy and author of «Just the Funny Party: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club» has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Before he gets me to play."
It's a maintenance value in the case.
Of course – unlike anything else on TV – actions in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights if immigrant families can be reunited and health to the global economy.
Emission is a luxury for which only the most privileged viewers have advice.
And yet, you are far from being an informed person when you are sitting in six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "Deepness in Background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafors' teacher's worth of 15 000 dollars (a plague of hybrids," said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
In any case, I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way more.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pown Stars", about Trump show's varied role and daily turn on the plate (krange with NFL, chamrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't skip one episode, or you'll be stuck after it.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27°C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he moved in and looked at MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He could not get rid of himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh met with the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we set up all of the old-day programs and people said this was the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most common inter-elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flow of money after a conversion of a convention district which ended with two seating representatives quarreling about the same seat.
This recent newly renovated city district in Pittsburgh is located with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a four-year supplementary election.
Lamb stands against another seating representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which is largely above the 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the decision of the High Court in Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were a fundamentally controversial manipulation of the electoral circles in the interests of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosion of campaign funding between the largest participation groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a short stay in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania 18 district to Congress in March.
This seat had been held by a republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the democracies a little leadership.
USA Assessmentd Criminal Action against El Salvador for Support to China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama entirely to the partners cast out of the management team of the Trump Organization.
Ambassadors of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a member of the department's number, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high employment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American embassies held a conference at the top level focusing on security and economic growth in order to follow up a similar collection in advance which was assessed as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from arriving in the United States.
However, by mid-September, officials in the top administration had made it clear that they wanted the Conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now committed to speaking to the conference, now planned in mid-October, in order to show the importance of the administration's adding the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three American expeditions returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or sanctions from Washington.
A speaker at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, particularly two diplomats, who were involved in discussing internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst attached to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next speaker in the box can be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible prevention of law enforcement by Trump, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is apparently also in progress to expand the review of whether the Trump campaign has been co-operated with Russia in our selection.
If the convention were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible for the body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his fellows.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that the fall of Trump is inevitable - and not for its opponents in Europe.
There must be a choice for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938 the Germans were able to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the checklaws at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of view, and the unfavourable march of democracy is accelerated or banned.
The Americans are up against several of these tip points now.
What will we do if Trump is shooting at the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the ship for Mueller's examination?
Rosenstein has been in great anguish since this newspaper announced that he had previously proposed secret talks by the President and speculated that he was not qualified to be President.
Rosenstein says The Times is wrong.
‘How will we react if the newly implemented FBI bordering of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is approved to the High Court in spite of credible overcrowding complaints and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the mid-election of a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we do not make those tests, democracy will stand in front of a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the experiences I've had in Prague.
My mother was a Tishsecolovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me farmed to draw satellite light on the table with the hacker.
With such an inheritance, how can I be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take up Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a view to winning over the Austrians after the devastating unrest in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European Union.
A knezed stopper Graham Dorrans to do his first action for the season in the undefeated fight 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jump board to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good law," said the 31st year.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and get a point with us.
Maybe we couldn't have entered the end, but it was unlikely a great result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and was the best layer.
It will be a big evening in Europe on Thursday.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good outcome in the final battle, but with the home audience in the back I'm sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
The previous year was absolutely tense, between everything that happened with the damages of mine and the replacements in the club itself, but it has a good feeling now.
The layer is good and good choice; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand now, add the previous season behind us and get it added."
Women lose sleep due to fear of pension saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear explanation of how they wanted to be dealt with, it was very few as they spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationalwide study spoke to the couple about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 % spoke to the children about it.
"People want to be taken over by someone in the family, but they don't do anything to take that call," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationalwide life insurance business.
That's what you're gonna do.
Talk to the couple and the children: You can’t prepare your family to give you support if you don’t say what you want in good time.
Discussions with the consultant and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices may be of great importance in determining the costs.
Include your financial adviser: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for your expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Save a few legal problems with the same.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care and ensuring that health workers will comply with your wishes if you would be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a trusted person to make economic decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Think your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to a hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter the details in a list so that you are ready.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake – who are the laws?" asked Martin.
"What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have it in place.’

A man was shot several times by air when he was on his way home after a night shift.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians described the protection, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "umotitative action".
The victim didn't see the victim.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have sent out witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Doghera Regent, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Doghía on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dothraa is a kingdom that extends over 300 km along coastal lines in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The accounts, an administrative region at provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the stock stocks of the central province of Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Doghía.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhaa have been framed by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian emergency aid administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghara.
A tsunami also struck West Dothraa in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Gulf of the Pacific and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia Aceh Province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes under the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most popular eye and dissolved a tsunami that hit the southern coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 within one of the Mantawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres as a result of tens of thousands of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake within the framework of the Pidi Jaya government in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the rulings of the mortal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no Tsunami resolution this time, but over 100 were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake covers Indonesia tourism Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and resulted in thousands of tourists being temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after his arrest.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, closure with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska Sub-State Policy.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a woman known when she tried to call the police to report the alleged seizure.
Palin will be arrested in the Mat-Su prison and held for an unsecured debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was made before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he dealt with the matter, reported the network.
Palin is faced with three classes of A, which means he can be held in jail for one year and placed a deposit of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B commission, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time it's presented a view against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged incident.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted for domestic violence, closed with the report on domestic violence and for possession of a weapon while being shot in connection with the event.
His boyfriend claimed he shot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterinary groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent attitude to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earth Map Tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after a earthquake within the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The Earth's frame is similar to the central Sulawesi, which lies north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the explosion.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu da Tsunamien living on the innover beach.
Federal opposition authorities are rarely seeking the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal opposition authorities in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulllo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York which killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been practised in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to launch an attack on a bicycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit footmen and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the alleged power must prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims ‘serious’ and caused serious physical injury with a view to seeking a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty under the case-law document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal major 22-point statement, including eight cases of money-pressure arrests, was used by federal opposition authorities in cases of organised crime, and a view of violence and car seizure.
The attack required "significant planning and continuation", said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried out it as "heavy, gross and demanding".
‘Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,’ states the notice of departure.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time Southern District of New York was doing something that could cause death.
According to Khalid Barnes, two drug dealers were sentenced to death, but eventually they were sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out spying on the Soviet Union during the so-called war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was held in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the researchers that he was happy about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the vision.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag at the hospital room, the police said.
He did not declare himself guilty after the statement of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defences for Saipov, said they were ‘publicly disappointed’ about the decision of the opposition authority.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a permit and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the dreams of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the opposition authorities not to seek a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage agreed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians would "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain "would have been excommunicated" now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge of May to ensue its deep split rivers has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a private demonstration against Brexit in town.
The Minister of State is fighting to keep the Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the withdrawal – and force Eurosceptors and Labor to choose between her package and ‘kaos’.
Bone told "Examination means notification" demonstrations in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject Brexit plan".
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to become subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
The people complained that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: "The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and our activists, who are actually those who cut the streets and get us elected in the first round.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.’
In a direct message to May, she added: "The Minister of State keeps the job when they keep their promises".
Farage said that the policies would be ‘pressed’ if they were to ignore the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians," he said.
"They're trying to deceive Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our policies, which are on the road to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize people's armies in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest before we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Imnes' Marser Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political collection in the center of town.
A small number of fans with Tories Against Brexit-banders after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis handled the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app at the beginning of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free-of-fraction border, for free trade without borders in Ireland’ he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering setting up a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "take it seriously as a presidential candidate" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the democracy from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a council meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, makes an election in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the household format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to become presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to get to Washington to fix our wrong government, and it includes a woman at the top".
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a year in his head and died as a result," said political chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and admitted he was on the spot and had his gun.
Simpson was arrested without arrest and put in custody at East Baton Rouge Parish policy.
Sims was a two-metre high-level youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season. The average of him was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per fight.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton focuses on the world's title after starmasters give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' star lord would play a big role in the course.
From Poland Bottas was given a good start and fat near Hamilton on the road while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Witnesses to attack his camera.
The witness entered the warehouse first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back part of the main field, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop around later and came out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton ran up after some jump with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly hole inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third row.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered as number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st year.
Then he led in many parts of the course while he was on the wheels to try to get to a quick conclusion and the superintendent Kimi Raikkonen as number four.
He finally arrived within the warehouse on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took four seats.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fun job all week and was an adequate gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fun job to get a good pay," said Hamilton.
It was a pretty bad body language.
President Donald Trump handed Senator Diane Feinstein a political order on Saturday for her statement that she did not play a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who was charged with sexual abuse by the Supreme Lawyer Brett Kavanaugh.
When the President spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony directly before the Senate's judicial committee. He commented instead that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "disconcealed, felt and spoke in vain".
“The only thing that could happen and the happy thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are sitting down and feeling sad and talking nonsense,” he said.
"When you look at performances and toys, they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I have not done so.’»
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you dance?
You remember her answer... you played the document--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not laughed.’»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't dance," he added, with a comparison of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent with detailed information on the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her rejection was not welcomed by the president, who, during the party meeting Saturday night, commented: "I'm going to tell you something, it was a pretty bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the highest-law candidate, who has been charged with sexual abuse of three women, the President stated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power with all necessary means.
You see the madness, the ignorance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass in order to get power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars set up for Friday's Elite League losses against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return battle in Dundee on Saturday.
In the early days, Giants was given a double lead through shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were compared to the home base before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League lost for the season for Adam Keef's men, who had come back after they shot Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the layers, and Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford left the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
During a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt left to Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The homemeal regrouped and Bouchard compared almost once with a specific target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen with giving Dundee's leadership for the first time during the fight late in second round, and he secured the stage with the layer's five-and-a-half way out at the end.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Flight commanders die to ensure that several hundred passengers escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia will be completely rescued after his death and ensure that a flight with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have turned around, and many have lost their lives after a powerful earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday and dissolved a tsunami.
Strong retreats continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily weakened control tower at Mutiana Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was waiting to see that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway right there, could safely be easy.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Talson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We cleared up a helicopter from Balikapan in Kalimantan to move him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts swelled when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rates may reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness agency reports that access to the cities of Doghía, Sig and Boutong is limited.
"The numbers are expected to increase further since many of the same numbers are still caught under the ruins and many have not been able to reach," said the teller of the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six metres high waves have raced Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You see ambulances coming around all the time.
There's a lack of clean water.
The minimum markets will be affected everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cors works February to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widododo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was founded by earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after flying crashed in the lava
The air carrier, who stole the plane as crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the approaching flight.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one man passenger they had not checked out.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and humanity after the plane hit the water while trying to land on the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The ministers said on Friday that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the plane in the boat is equal to outside the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to swim through medium-distance water to the emergency exit on the approaching plane.
He said the pilots had panic and screamed, and he got a little bit of headache.
U.S. Navy told the seamen who worked near to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using a flimsy boat to carry people in the country before the plane dropped about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been hit by PNG-registered aeroplanes in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the time line for the night a woman was burned alive
The paying authorities concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of having married a woman from Mississippi living in 2014.
USA Analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to put together the movements of 29 years old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several mobiles that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, something that fought against what he had previously claimed, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as his cell phone to Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police stopped talking to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the actor asked about Tellis spoke the truth when he claimed to be in the trailer at Sanford that night, he said that he "was lying because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints indicate they've only known each other in one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, destroyed Tellis' call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence shall start its proceedings on Sunday following the plan.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Width: What's a society-wide hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image to the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Broad from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origin of political messages to raise social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and create a socialised hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new flowering in Britain through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Children's passports in New York are searching for a divorce pair after a "rasistic" message
A child passenger in New York is looking for a couple of discriminatory divorces after receiving a wrong message from the mother, who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the search with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a baby mother, expressed hope when she found out that the new child passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
‘NEEEEEIII AND A SVART PERSON’ wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an 'uncomfortable' Plasco-Flaxman who said up to Maurice, arguing that their reported child passenger, who was African, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now seeks compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation in the order of size $350 per day for the six-month period, the release-based arrangement she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she said to New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned their back on the charges that they are racist and say the rejection of Maurice was the only right, since they didn't feel able to trust her after she had approached her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Mr. Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have abandoned your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come back.’
The comparison of the search target with "expression" says Plasco was due that his wife had only two months to end and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Is there such a person you want to punish?
It is not in particular fine", added the shareholders.
As the legal case goes on, the public court has been quick to condemn couples on social media and criticise them for their behavior and attitudes.
Left to Paddington afraid readers would not accept a talking beer, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to sit in the other place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It is very foolish to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the book of a small doll, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60-year-old chance of making a bookout was "biter suit" after he left.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father in secret was very proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he was no hidden person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as when you had a child that made a mistake: you're proud of it even though it's not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his fantasy, he always wanted to give the honor to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
At landing, the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the legal work was denied to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it seemed so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the phone from Nad that she said came to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'll be right there.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine had given her the heart to kill, lost its effect slowly and left the system.
She died an hour earlier and the organs of the body were stuck together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn't calm down and cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take me together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now took care of the daughter's loss, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the tests she had passed.
"No one knew," she says.
"I saw all the time and the stars ran into a seven stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming feeling of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards with caring women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide, work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up mail cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was framed by depression and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day, ” she says.
The 45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him on the slide.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He ended up at work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother to Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm worried all the time that it's going to be an infection."
Sharon created the cards "to tell people there are people out there who can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Not for yourself - you need to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or anything,” she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noted the amended vote.
On 1st of July, he was in the basement – when the kids opened the holidays, they didn’t get any contact or anything.’
She says his death was a great dream for them, but they have to fight through it: “There is a big hole in the family.
That's what's happening to us.
But we all have to keep out and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin wire while the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought that if we could get to anything he asked for – a time-limited and extensive review – we might perhaps come to a certain agreement," said Flake on Saturday, and let him fear that the Committee 'falls from each other' along the fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support players want the FBI to examine?
The response was due to the timing.
The mid-elections are only five weeks apart on 6 November – if the Republicans are likely to do something bad, it will be much more difficult for them to get the man they want to be elected to the highest law in the country.
George W. Bush has called on senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley where she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate so that vice-president Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him admitted to high court.
Number of North Korean "falls" under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's collection department, said it had been 1127 downloads in four – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices in human mussels were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
Most of North Korea's miners are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flows through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly populated demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the refugees to be illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South – as technically still in war – has improved considerably over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the final negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, gave the blame for the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no opportunity for us to sit alone first," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not qualified to sit in high school
The Minority Head of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called High Lawyer Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperature that made him unable to sit in high law.
Pelosi brought up his comments in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh welcomed the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Because they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very sensitive to his opening statement, Immigrantly almost cried and was very nervous when he talked about the family and the years of the rehearsal.
He was also strongly critical of the Democrats of the Committee and called the allegations against him a 'grotesque and coordinated character assault' organised by liberals who were aware that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the highest court since it shows that he was pre-eminent against democracies.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such opinions and how he attacks the Clinton Parliament and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi complained when she was asked if she would try to set up Kavanaugh for wealth if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only incapable of sitting in high-level law, but also in the right he is currently sitting”, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (absorption rights), since he was considered to be a conservative judge.
In the investigation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would review certain higher law decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, party person to the High Court and expect us to appeal to it," Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair bear, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're sitting," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so rare, do you?"
She continues: "I got the good help of a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was sitting, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was sitting and started crying, she told the person she spoke to "You think I might be sad because I cry.
I'm sorry."
And then she just continued.
And it seemed to me that I was amazing."
Tears are allowed as part of the result of their fundamental misunderstanding.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was at a man-dominated office. I began to cry with inexplicably racistness and was caught in the back of an older woman's neck – a cool boss I had always been a little saved for – who threw me into a trapper room.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're hot.
They will believe you are hired and happy because they are ready to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was appointed presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was released to be exhausted from the wedding on board a boat like the Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought there was nothing on the way to investigate the possibilities of becoming a presidential candidate himself.
"It was not a revised decision," she said with a later 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones needed one.
Some called it "Snooze White and the Seven Doves".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore she wouldn't settle if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the support players that gave $1,000 to men, she only gave $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she kept speaking to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money in and reach voters instead of delegates, and think about sexism - that she fell together in tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press mentioned her.
"You should think Kleineex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my grave support?
'Is she crying?'
How US China Trade Wars Can Get Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were enormous, and even though the fight was far from over, a relationship between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, delivered the first warning earlier this year by adding customs to important Chinese exports, consisting of solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, recovered every time, at the latest with a five to ten percent increase in US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the United States attack, and the world's next largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to make demands, but public opposition to the United States will be too overwhelming for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the U.S. trade war can give China a positive outlook in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions that start economic ringing in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have put in place before," said Abigail Grace, a research colleague who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Center, a thinky.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which has been raced for more than 7 years by war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and certainly thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The State continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that they had to take in their daily lives and their bread.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouelem said that the Syrian regime would take good care of rebuilding the damaged country.
However, he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries which supported the suspension would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup sailing in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after hitting Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe's back to the throne when the ship to the Danish legislator Thomas Björn got the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who, even under much of the tournament, suffered his tea shots in the water at par-3 16th floor, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was brilliant in all its rounds and became 1 of 4 golf players who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed from 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European layer, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most advanced players, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind, Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament through the times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't care to cry, but today I can't be.
It's been twenty years.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me up and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get back the cup.
It's about the layer, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European stage.
He leaves the penthouse to his countryman John Ram, who shot the American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed the man close to the growth," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four battles in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics for one of the biggest golf games ever, which has won 14 major titles, just killed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the whole weekend finding the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. Legal Captain Jim Furyk said after an impressive performance for his troops, "I'm proud of these cars, they're bought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hate of Thomas.
He's a great warlord.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their lawman.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were killed."
