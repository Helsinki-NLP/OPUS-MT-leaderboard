I didn't notice her.
I didn't know she was sick.
I didn't know Tom was on his own.

We didn't want to do that?
Didn't Tom get his car there?
I didn't mean to?
Didn't I have to do it myself?
I didn't say that?
Didn't that happen?
Not all of this?
Why not?
Why didn't you eat a cake?
Why don't you sit down and relax?
Why don't you show us?

Who's this book for?
Who's that?
Who the hell are these guys?
Isn't that important even?
You haven't come yet.
No one's coming.
Tom didn't come to the party last night.
No one's gonna hurt me.

That shouldn't have happened.
I shouldn't have come back.
I shouldn't have treated alcohol.
I didn't wake up and I became Sami Zabona Alofa in my place of night.
I won't.
I'm not gonna go through your second mistakes.

Let's take a short break.
Let's take a picture like this.
I won't let her go there.
I won't run my show for Tom.

No one's gonna hurt you.
I'll never feel it.
No one's gonna listen to you until you say something wrong.
The meeting will not be reached at a certain time.
The radio won't work.
It's not gonna hurt Tom.

It's a terrible end to this piece.
If you tell me the truth, I'm sorry.
If I wanted to scare you into thinking about what I've been dreaming for a few weeks.
If I married her mother because she had entered a mental illness hospital.
That's the water with the oil.
If I'm allowed, a little bit of the environment to keep the environment from falling into chaos.
If I'm allowed, do you know what it's supposed to be tomorrow night?
Lucy from America.
If something's fun, I want to do it, of course.
If only I'd been a little longer!
If that is true, we will accept this conclusion.
If I told you the truth, you'd be shocked.
If I were you, would I do the same thing?
Don't help your father.
I didn't have to live with her now.
If you didn't help me, I'd make it.
If Tom didn't get here, why did he come?
Lenny's favorite is red.
I have one sister.
I was able to go to the concert.
Lettney was capable of this case for two years.
I have three sisters.

It's not a big deal.
You can't come in because you're short.
You can't see this.
You can't teach a dog the taste of new movements.
You can't stop him.
You can't all come in.

You're not young, are you?
Not long.
Not every day.
I don't have Oshham.
I don't have any problems with the equipment.
I don't have time.
You don't have animals or plants, do you?
This isn't a white miracle.
There's no hospitals near his house.
Tom's not the right person for the job.
It's not an air in this room.
Not all women in the world expect to be mothers.
That's not what I can do.
That's not what I mean.
That's not what you're doing.
That's not what you're doing.
It's not my turn.
It's not a cause of fear.
There's nothing anyone can do about it.
It's not necessarily necessary that everything that science says is always right.
You don't have to apologize.
We don't have to do that every day.
I have only half of his books.
I don't have time to help you solve your obligation.
I don't have an account in these forums.

You don't have to go.
You're not supposed to smoke here.
It's not what we used to do.
It doesn't matter.
It's not what you say, it's what you do.
That's not what I wanted to tell you about.
There is no doubt that Islam is an integral part of America. I believe that America is a common hope among us all regardless of race, religion or social status: it is the hope of living in peace, security, education, work and expression of love for our families and societies as well as for our children. This is our common title and the hope of mankind together.
