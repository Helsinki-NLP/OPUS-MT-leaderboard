Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the picture of the Flags"
It is perceived as coercion among some members of the Assembly facing the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal is the result of programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it can stay with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Wales, twp means creatinine and pwp means hunting.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Galese Conservative Party said to be "open" to the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in French is expressed in a similar manner to the English address of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Committee on the Assembly, which is currently at the stage of the decision to introduce amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors how the members of the House will be called will of course be a debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted to the Galician Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided broad support for the possibility of calling the Assembly of Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the House, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Galse Members), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could show a gratitude to President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further amendments to the operation of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the Committees' system.
AMs will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians return to the Urs for the referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday the voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to put an end to a debate over decades with the Greek border, which has a province called Macedonia.
It has long stated that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the name change, said that he would not take into account the outcome of the vote.
However, the sponsors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are sitting while Harlem's churches are in difficulty
"The elders I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner in the past," Adams said.
"Today none of the two are here."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as the churches are concerned, the money from the sale of inheritances will not last as long as the leaders are expected, "and first or later they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condoms filled with the type of persons who will not help the remaining sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings is white," he says, "and for this reason they will regret the time when these churches will close everything because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraternite before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original white-medium congregation if it went into the '30s.
A black congregation that was praying in a nearby church owned the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with head of the John Howard Johnson Reverence, who led the campaign against the 125th street vendors, one of the main roads for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take or promote color people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners programmed his reconstruction, they also ordered carillon.
Reverent David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the campaign of the poor."
The expert who sounded the carillon in July called it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed on to a larger carillon to the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complex array of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by church lay officials, others from Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the parish governing body, composed of a lay leader, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns about the fact that the diocese "was trying to download costs" on the parish assembly even though it was not involved in the assumption of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Squalo spends a 13-year fishing fishing in California
Official sources say that Saturday a school attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was on his way to search for aragosts in California, during the day of opening the aragost season.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that for half an hour he had been hanging out with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and he jumped up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at the beginning that he was just excited about the capture of an aragost but then "he realized that the boy was crying 'I've been poisoned!
I've been poisoned!'
Her entire clavicle was sick," she said she had noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a glass in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was recovered under critical conditions.
The species of the shoulder responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles has declared during a communication to the media that a few weeks ago a school was visited in the area, but that it was declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim immediately suffered trauma in the upper area of the tower.
The authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury's programme a push towards the beauty product sector in the United Kingdom
Saninsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large store assigned to specialist assistants
As part of the important push towards the United Kingdom beauty product market of 2.8 billion esterlines, which continues to grow while sales in fashion and household products are declining, the largest rates for beauty products will be tested in 11 businesses in the country and adopted in more businesses next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on cascades once dedicated to televisions, microwave supplies and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double the sizes of his offer of articles for beauty until he reached the 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a greater space with areas like those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique truck range so that most products are v√§ani - a quality that is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfumer The Fragrance Shop will experiment with authorisations in two Saninsbury's shops, the first of which has opened in Croydon, southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily at small district shops have forced supermarkets to commit more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, deputy administrator of Saninsbury's, said that sales points will be more and more similar to large stores while the supermarket chain seeks to withstand discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury's has introduced the points of sale Argos into hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has prompted food sales and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to cut off its parts of beauty and pharmaceutical products has resulted in failure.
Saninsbury's has tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but synergy has ended in a debate on the division of income from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sanisbury's sold three years ago his pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million sterline.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, said: "We have transformed the aspect of our aspects of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in well-formed colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand range has been developed to meet every need and the welcome environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "frust" after Holly Willoughby's 11 million sterling deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is angry after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from an 11 million-sterline contract with his brand of trend to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Casalingi and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This morning's rapporteur, 37 years old, appealed to Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, angry after being withdrawn from their trendy brand business in the last minute to focus on his new special contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones was "heavy" when the TV gold girl admitted during a thesis meeting at the central headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million sterline - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their trademark of Casalingi and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was calculated to double Willoughby's heritage, estimated at around 11 million stars.
Not long after Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to go to one of his vacation residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It was his future in the long term that he would have committed to it for the next twenty years.
His decision to quit left all the people involved completely without saying a word.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a store full of products at Marlow's general district, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the absence of this morning's representative, one of the United Kingdom's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of strong investments in products that come from kitchens and candies to dress and homework and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, he joined the company as president in March.
Couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to the TV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to make comments about his business."
Hard words and "then we're in love"
He commented on the criticisms that he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presiding" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice to imitate the "televisional driver".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first incident in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho turned to world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea has not observed an "equivalent response" from the United States to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is continuing to impose sanctions once again to keep pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we're getting great results," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve Kim's relationships had yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the liberation of hostages and the return of the latest American military.
And he defended his own inconsistencies by describing his relationships with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here in front," Trump said, pointing to the front page.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations were reported that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, national emergency was not declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, I have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children are organizing a team that will return to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sotopo, the representative of the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the threats that Indonesia has continued to face, the country continues to be terribly impressed by the anger of nature.
Although refugees have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure at other costs.
The apparent lack of a siren alarm for tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human life.
In the best conditions, it is difficult to find ourselves among the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship en route to Lombok to see the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but they will take us at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of the infrastructures in Indonesia's brands at the centre of his electoral campaign and has invested money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit the administration of Joko while preparing for the reelection next year.
Joko must also face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes because of confrontations on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, which fight using masks, arches and frescoes and other rustic weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool stands against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at 89 minutes on Saturday, in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with his team under 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second ball.
The attempt went up the front of the door as it turned to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally falls into the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga by sinking into the network.
"I was just trying to put myself in place, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play ahead, so I tried to create me as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much and I shot."
The Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at 25 minutes marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The center of Blue went through the roof at Matthew Kovacic before walking close to half the field and landing in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic has made a quick crossing to half the field.
So he's made a beautiful trip that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up on the second floor with a left hole beyond Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia living in 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters said Sunday morning.
A number of people have been reported to be trapped between the mackerel of buildings broken down following the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 which struck the country on Friday and generated up to 6 metres high, reported to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been devastated by damages from damaged buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gun wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only at the beginning but I would like to launch an appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who had seen or heard something suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to launch an appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on dashcam so that we can contact us because it could provide important information for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was returned was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who said they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of the event this morning.
The investigations are under way and the police have declared that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was contacted by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he discovered what had happened.
The residents were informed that they would need hours before they were allowed to come back.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a scene of crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
Keep saying "it's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police trucks were located within the delimited zone and another van was just outside.
Several agents were located within the delimited area by controlling the building of apartments.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statute of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "recording of history"
It would be poetic justice for its destruction by the Taliban of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatics of Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as "foliage" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of the stats that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclastia during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is the proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many consider to be still celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender from external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
What is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and remembered."
Mayale killer shoots a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a mayor in a market in South-West China while the news spread by local media.
The man, who was only identified with the name "Yuan", was brought back dead with a recycled artery, covered with blood near a porcelain on the market of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, referred to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A Mayal Lifter is prepared to inject vaccines to the May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that she had traveled with the cousin from Yunnan County border to sell 15 miles to the market.
The next morning, the cook found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby porcelain was open.
He said there was a big man with blood on his chest in the porcelain.
A French analysis confirmed that the 250 kg measles had exposed the alleviator to statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and macillates," said the cousin identified with the nickname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan who entered the market at 4.40 p.m. to give him food to his uncles.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the mayor was arrested to prevent other people from attacking him, while the police collected evidence on the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the allivator.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on people by monkeys have already been reported in the past.
In 2016 a mayor attacked a woman and her husband in their factory in Massachusetts, causing a series of injuries to man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg mealie closed a Gale farmer to his tractor until the wife managed to escape the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was divorced by his monkeys in 2012, a survivor of Manitoba told CBC News that the monkeys are not usually aggressive but that the blood taste can be "catalising".
"They just want to play.
They're funny, very curious... they don't want to do bad.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The rocks of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong storms in the South-West of the United States
As predicted, the Rosary is losing its strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the southwestern coast of the United States in the next days.
Rosa registered up to 138 km/h, a category 1 hurricane at 5 ET hours on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a sacrament is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north, in the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the Monday day.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby sacchart will create heavy and broad precipitations in the south-western area in the next few days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous unforeseen floods, floods of waste and possible storms in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates which will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at certain points, particularly in the areas of the Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of 2,5-10 cm of rain in some areas of the south-west, in particular on most of the Arizona, are planned.
It is possible to verify unforeseen floods with conditions in rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical storms.
It is strongly advised to make progress in the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong waves could make the canyons of the rivers full and the temporarys would bring wind to suffocate and carry dust.
The approach will cause strong local flooding on the coast of southern California.
It will be possible to precipitate more than 1 cm, which could cause limited flow of waste and discharges.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the cold season.
Some scattered tropical beaches will begin to get closer to Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the beaches become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Very bad will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong oscillations of temperatures in the United States while the Artico cools, but the tropicals will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature variations on short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in Central America will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next days, the summer's remaining heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected to start in October for most of the Central and Eastern United States, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York they will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a strong probability of temperatures on the average for the East US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have followed on Thursday on six television networks the promising deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have happened in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political impasse continues, with the issuers who interrupt regular programming for the last minute of Friday: an agreement proposed by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake so that the FBI conducts a week's investigation into the charges.
Ford informed the Court's Justice Commission that it is true 100% of the fact that Kavanaugh made her ill-fated and tried to rob her during a party at the top.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that sent it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often finds it difficult to understand the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican has issued a statement stating that it would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Fleke was withdrawn by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while he was insulted by demonstrators while he was trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while he was retested and transferred from life to CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
He was told "You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have something else to say during the hearing of the Commission.
All cable networks and issuers have been transferred by live hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the name of Kavanaugh at the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would have done so only with the confidence that the FBI would have analyzed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as required by the Democrats of the Minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have had the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused the critics of "politicalism" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused those who criticise their programmes to let the European Union "political face" with the future of Great Britain and reiterates national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the prime minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chechers agreement for Brexit, stating that a proposal according to which Great Britain and the EU must risk their taxes is "very ridiculous"
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrest the suspect of the death of the LSU player Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a suspect of death by fire by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on a second-degree murder charge, told Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities have made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his eyes during the battle.
The police recovered their eyes from the scene of the crime and said they had discovered Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB television station affiliated to CBS.
After asking Simpson, the police said the suspect allowed him to accidentally shoot Wayde.
The security was fixed at $350,000, the defense lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge's legal doctor's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, in which he claims that the cause of death is a gun wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the refugees of the state of Louisiana, the police science laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the area order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where Father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 returns to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU's coach Will Wade said that the team is "discovered" and "under shock" for Wayne's death.
"That's what you're worried about at all times," said Wade.
Vulcano Cosparage of Cinnamon City of Mexico
The scene outside the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Calamities warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in crater and 183 gas emissions and centrifuges were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various holes and hiding.
Images on the social media have shown undercensorships of centenarians covering the parachutes of cars in the city district of Mexico like Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" is active since 1994.
Police cuts with Catalan separatists to monitor the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters met with the anti-Summous police teams and thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to remind them of the first anniversary of the Catalan vote against the secession.
A group of masked separatists banned by the anti-Smomous police has beaten the police with eggs and cast vernishes into dust, creating cloudy clouds of dust on the streets that often bother tourists.
Further meetings were conducted during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We won't forget, we won't forgive" were confronted by the Unionists who shouted "Lunga Life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive care for mild wounds received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognised by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the influence was low, and the Catalans against the section had largely blocked the vote.
In the presence of the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop violent attacks against the referendum that was taking place around the corner of the region.
Independent groups were camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he had no hope for the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy for the possibility of voting, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory despite the regional elections of last December, the independent Catalan parties have made it difficult to maintain this year's slant, with many of the most famous leaders of the movement who find a voluntary asylum or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered with his phone the police-supported protest, said that the conflict was fueled by the policies of the two parties.
"The situation is increasingly thematic," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders in prison waiting for the end of last year, announced that he would be running the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to report the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after spying a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly beaten a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the canals and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a ballast at a certain point.
Menga's attack defeats Livingston's victory at 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
Livingston's already promoted left the Rangers surprised by representing Steven Gerard to his second defeat in 18 parties as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's bullet made the difference while Gary Holt's team went through the second division with the Hibernian.
So Gerarrd's team remains without a win outside home in the Premiership this season and will have to face the next Sunday's first in the Hearts class, from which 8 points separate them.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining over six parties, with the Holt coach who has yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's opening up opportunities against the little incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage right before the goal, with their immediate response that caused Ranger many problems.
Scott Robinson has dug up but has traced his action before the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow has only been able to walk out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halkett's head stroke on the other side of the door.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they could have made it difficult for visitors with square legs.
And it was so that the crucial goal was realized.
The Rangers have given up a punishment football and Livingston has found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have succeeded in passing to Menga, which has been able to sign from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had ruled in the possession of the palla but the defense of the host team had proved impeccable and the porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos had committed Kelly to a preparation.
Scott Pittman saw his gol attempt stopped by the Rangers Allan McGregor porter's feet and Lithgow made a shot out of another game scheme in Livingstone.
The cross took place in the Livingston area and were constantly neutralized, while two demands of strength, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand, were rejected.
A "fenomal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome the expectations along this extraordinary track.
Their game styles and collaborators have changed little from their return to the maximum series, but you need to give Holt a lot of credit for how he managed to track the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, headed by a masterly defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Despite the excellent performances at times with Gerard, in this case they have fallen well under these standards.
The last pass is missing - only once have succeeded in entering the enemy area - and you can consider an alarm campaign for the Rangers, which are half-classified.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Colonia
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of the dispute visited Germany by President Erdogan, to extend relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of print and access to the EU by Turkey.
So Erdogan is heading towards Colonia for the opening of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police had justified the intervention for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have heard their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
The protests reflect the disposition caused by a visitor who was considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called after others.
Road incident in Deptford: cyclist dies in reverse with a car
A cyclist died in the back with a car in London.
The incident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road trafficked by Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the floor.
The incident took place months after another cyclist was destroyed, invested by a pirate on the street in Children Street, about a thousand from where the Saturday incident occurred.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses and buses were blocked and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during an order
Six prison guards were injured during an accident at the maximum security men's prison, he reported to the prison office.
The bullet is aimed at the maximum safety men's prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST around Sunday and is still running.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were used to manage the tumor, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison hall.
The agents were treated on site for mild facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison staff accurately formated has been prepared to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We would not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons, and all the responsible will be reported to the police and may be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin prison hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-smomosa agents were called to intervene in prison to sit in a violent storm during which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
The Rosa hurricane threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with unforeseen floods (which could benefit the areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week when the last energy of the Rosa hurricane will cross the south-west of the desert, creating unforeseen floods.
The national weather service has already issued warnings of unprecedented floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona until the southern and eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday night with tears.
Phoenix's national weather service has reported on a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the state of tropical storms or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uregans include precipitations between 5 and 10 cm, with small isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-western area, including the central rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with small isolated up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of unforeseen floods, the rain caused by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these assumptions will probably be positive because the south-west area is currently going through a drought period.
Being at the Center for the Monitoring of Scythes, slightly more than 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme systicity, the second largest category," noted weather.com.
Initially, the path of the Rosa hurricane will be able to land through the Basa California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the force of Uragan Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will confront the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or on Monday night.
Precipitations on the part of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitations are expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, so that she will head through Arizona and the southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that could be caused by Rosa or her strategists is intense precipitations in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the southern western desert area of the United States," the National Centre for Uregans reported.
It is expected that such floods can generate potentially fatal floods and floods of waste in the deserts, as well as in the mountains.
Midsomer Northon aggression: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a six-year-old was found with gun wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to hospitals, where he remains under "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock area, reported to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have withdrawn from the phone what has happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered for the punishment and anger" of the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the extreme and extreme tactics of the democratic party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered for the torture and anger" of the democratic party during the entire process of appointment.
Kavanaugh has taken the lead at the Thursday Congress, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual violence in his dealings with the decades ago when they were still young.
Ford also appealed to the hearing by defending himself from the charge.
The President said Saturday that "the American people could observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced of the rights of our time, a lawyer with outstanding precedents in public service," he said in front of a number of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the name of Kavanaugh by discussing the importance of the Republican influence on midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really going to do it," he said.
"That's why I've been crying strangely for exceptional candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are committed to "resisting and stopping."
The first basic procedural vote at the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, as a senior GOP assistant has said to the CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes in Indonesia and tsunamis, and the victims' numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many scattered from the giants who have fallen down on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when up to 6 metres (18 feet) were thrown down on the beach to the crepuscolle, spreading through many people killing and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the Tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and are not running immediately, becoming such a victim," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, manager of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it traversed with its car, trunks, houses, hit anything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people are out on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs published by the disaster agency have shown a number of destroyed buildings and shops, surrounding and collapsed bridges and a pool surrounded by water.
The aid costs continued to cost the city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake of Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The city's geography, which was at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the dimensions of the tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the damage as "aesthetics" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were rocked.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the walls of broken buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho stated that the victims and the damages could be larger along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in a area called Dogh√≠a, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "have been completely paralyzed, with no information" by Donghaa, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In a amateur video shared on social media, a man is sitting on a top floor of a building that shouts excitedly to warn of the tsunami coming to people on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall, it fell on the beach, spaced by buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief operations.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other goods.
The city airport has only been opened for aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget of the victims of tsunamis in Indonesia is over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the staff of the World Vision of Doghaa managed to reach and save the city of Palu, where the employees were fled under repair from the roof in their office courtyards, during the tragedy they had encountered a scene of destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they've seen lots of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while relief groups have started the difficult start operations of the relief arrangements, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue operators with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the quake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of the dispersion still maintained the hope that their loved ones would have done part of the miracles that led to the tragic stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was pulled out by a truck.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been blocked under the masks for two days with her mother's body nearby.
Gendon Subandon, the founder of the Indonesian national team of parapension, had trained for Asian Games this month in Indonesia two of the scattered parapension pilots.
Among the people involved at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandige, were his students.
"As veterans in the parapension sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the release of the news about the Roa Roa Hotel's crolle within the parapension community, he had sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of Greek spongy instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
ruban thieves $26,750 during a banknote delivery at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's operator who was providing a banknote at Newport on the Levee, while at a press release from Newport's police department.
The driver of the vehicle was driving a bankmate in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, researcher Dennis McCarthy said in the communiqu√©.
While he was busy, another man "was thrown at the back of Brink's employee" and stole a purse with money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified several suspects who fled the crime scene while in the press, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the matter.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changing his name in Ye.
When he announced the change of his name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person officially noted as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been renamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eight album, which was released in June.
The change took place before your participation at Saturday Night Live, where you will present your new album, Yandhi.
In the program, singer Ariana Grande, who has canceled his participation for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and meaning 'you' has said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Radio Big Boy.
"When it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have been through Kanye, which means the only, simply Yes - the reflection of our goodness, of our plight, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
An ex-collator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without treatment and major letters.
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of a bloody confrontation against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to force the Mexican people."
The soldiers were shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when students on the left were taking their feet across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly subsidies to students and learning more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities pushed young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funds in this field, says IA investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow the announcements by various U.S. government groups about IA, although in the United States there is generally no formal IA strategy.
In the meantime, China has presented its programme last year: it intends to be the country No. 1 in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget in the search for IA would be a good start to consider that all the other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in IA," said Lee.
Redoublement of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month from the editorial house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the major companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the '80s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and subsequently was directed at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee remembered the previous United States government technological competitions such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it will be next, in order to identify new viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that is leading the leaders in academic terms, they're multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have received light from universities to work on IA projects.
She said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to encourage its efforts in the area of IA.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State has published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, such as the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organisations, which distributes funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States has established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House has announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research on IA.
At the same time, the US order to establish a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not recorded activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia" a motion that would resolve the long-term debate with Greece which has blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours constitutes a pretext on its territory and has put the veil on Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments have signed an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalists believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote for the referendum and the voting campaign raised doubts about the possibility of affluence to achieve at least 50% of the required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It is in agreement with NATO and the EU and with the agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is the price to pay so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a majority of two-thirds in stock.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularity until 1 p.m.
However, inflation was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
The first Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which would open the door to NATO and the European Union accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small park and systeming the chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to book the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go to high head, not to the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, which record a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of us because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influence.
Another survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, inflation must be more than 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious attack on the government's policies since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City sign a gol avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were engaged in the defense of Brighton during the 2-0 win game from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium of Manchester, England.
Ageiro seemed extremely easy to score at 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a half-field pass at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before he got caught in the free field.
Ageiro thus found himself surrounded by four yellow greens.
He humiliated a defender before crossing different boundaries at the border of the Brighton area.
So he made a left-hand trip, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in area to restore the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat the bridge of Brighton Matthew Ryan with a right arrow on the network.
"Aguero is having problems on his feet," said the journalist of the City, Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that it was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal has arrived at 29 minutes.
Ageiro got the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball into the network shortly before leaving the field.
The City will battle against the Hoffenheim in the tournament of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium of Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play track against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which keep an advantage of a game on Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a resurgence with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without purpose, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the maximum level of this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to drive?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but it is said that they are inclined to let Scherzer launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, had a launch session on Thursday and would be the first starter on his regular rest Sunday.
The Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Jump to a radun in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the influence of Republicans on midterm elections.
"All we did was play in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the great, great -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving it to me to fight for this for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We see this horrible group of radical democracies, which is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using any means necessary, it is possible to see the catheterry, the machine.
They don't care who can hit, who must work to get power and control back, because that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, gave the mission of "resisting and stopping."
"And it's been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "angered, vicious, machine and buggery."
He referred to the Senate's Justice Commission with the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on behalf of the Commission, throwing strong fish between the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did he cross the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I look like a--that was a bad language of the body--the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The labyrinth is no longer very tolerant.
Don't take people who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of members of the Labour Parliament to which they have been notified that they are not welcome, and because they have all said what they thought.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan has received a similar treatment because he is opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship has criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy was in agreement with previous leaders.
The opinion for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we would like the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, the Friday evening meetings have been exactly like this.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and short" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been remembered.
It has become more and more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or less for the party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the head of the party, and colleagues I had previously thought of sharing a similar political vision began to expect an investment of a tendency on my part and that I had taken positions that I would never accept, which were national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it is not really important what I say - they continue to resort to abuses on social media that demand my withdrawal, accusing the central policy and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am sure to be more fortunate than my other colleagues because my direct comments tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexual or racist abuse every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is the normalization of levels of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the labor party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motivation to challenge or modify the rules of choice, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given many suggestions, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my views so openly and everything would "be fine".
But it's not to do this I've been involved in politics.
Since I entered the labyrinth 32 years ago, caused by the government's incarceration of Thatcher that had left my secondary school class literally to fall into pieces, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor my recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somehow distracted by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is precipitating to a Brexit that will harm family nuclear, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of a labor force.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters who are members of the labor force or less: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Ayr with a scale of classification
Two late attempts might in some way have weighted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this extremely fun game of the day of Tennent's championship.
They're now on top of the class, the only team of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our parties so far and we're still under arrest, so I have to be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize Ayr's merit, they have taken better advantage of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow cartel for Scottish player Rory Hughes, won by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to talk about the numbers and Jason Baggot achieved an unconverted target.
Climo has increased the distance of Ayr with a rigor before, right in half time, to sign and thus to convert a target from just to take Ayr to 17-5 to the range.
But Melrose started well the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
So there has been a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarahh Knott, which has been extended, and at the beginning, Ayr has been rebalancing for advantage thanks to a target of Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
The Deputy Captain of Air Blair Macpherson thus received a yellow cartel and Melrose paid the man more with an unconverted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of great pressure.
The home team is back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cartel for a contrast with the airless climate, from the touch of the rigor, MacPherson marked a touch down behind the mix in advance of the Air.
Climo turned, as he had done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had picked up his foot from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth target of the team of home.
Still Game Star is looking for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after finding out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56th actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which writes and interprets along with the long-term partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the next nine series would also be the final of the show and that Kiernan seems to be thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Being on official reports lists, he is the director of Aposimorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of Scottish Sun found out that Kiernan wanted to become involved in Glasgow's "progressed restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia has no spot on the sea hope that a court will open its way to the Pacific
The mariners patrol a ship's general district covered with sartiame in La Paz.
Public buildings exhibit an ocean blue flag.
The ships from Lake Titicaca to the river of the Amazon are decorated with the word: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia there is no doubt about the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to resuscitate the Pacific Ocean once more.
These hopes may have reached the maximum level in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the slant, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is expecting the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Aia Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of interlocutory dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a gap on the State's sea of competence.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the elections next year - is very in the mood for Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will find it difficult to decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change if it did.
The United Nations agency with headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes within six months of the final rounds indicates that the case was ‚Äònot complicated‚Äô, said Paz Z√°rate, an international Chilean expert.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Z√°rate said.
The bulging rhetoric of Morale has exposed any good intentions remaining of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussions after what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia to Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly closed.
Monday, Bolivia will be able to "best exceptional opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end into 139 years of disagreement with each other," he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the sea issue as political eschamage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen without trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never commit nuclear disarmament if it could never trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to believe in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intent on relaunching diplomatic negotiations after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is an "illution" that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never undermine North Korea.
Washington is difficult to release the statement without first having major disarmament actions taken by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread scepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is intended to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion slippers present the latest trend in huge envelopes that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to extend your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, do not look for more.
The Valentino and Thom Browne Stylers have revealed that they are going through a series of puzzle puzzles for their spring - summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Very few practical hats have made them mad at Instagram this summer and these Stylers have sent their exciting creations on the passerella.
The main part of Valentino was an overcrowded beige cape decorated with a wide board similar to pneume that has hit the head of the models.
Other oversize accessories included angles of angled angles, a handle cap and ananas - but they were not designed to have your head warm.
Tom Browne also presented a choice of magic masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks present cucumbers and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than at high angles.
One creation looked like a complete immersion with mask and glasses, while another looked like a frozen frozen conco.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
The observatories of the style provide that huge berrets could reach you on high-mode roads.
The outside hats arrived on the ski of "La Bomba", the flag hat with a wider fabric than a meter that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of worship behind the very little practical hat that has invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the pastel: a beach bag in large flags almost as much as the model in custom as the door.
The rose-coloured orange rose, refined with friggin in rafia and with a white leather handle, was the strong part of the 2019 spring-state collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera to Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury shops next summer, as the stylist has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for supersede accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of specials resulting from exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As education sector capable of developing and adopting a custom school study plan, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you talk to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder of the fact that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are above the graduates, with the highest percentages of success within independent schools.
68% of the students who have studied foreign languages have obtained the maximum votes.
The data collected from the 74 schools of SCIS showed that 72% of students received the highest vote in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental competences for children and young people, which will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Languages, as choice of materials, are currently considered at the same level of STEM materials (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and others.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons why employees have indicated the difficulty in covering jobs are attributed in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead to a multilingual person in charge of competition.
At a survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level in order to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a percentage to two digits, 15%.
That is why investing in teaching languages is so important for today's children.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in taught languages.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be different languages among which you choose in independent schools, with the trained teacher staff specialized in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the country's future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Chosen Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans who expect LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' allelener Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-majored opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be fixed for how many minutes it'll play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell has tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the start of the week training, James was asked what his plans were for the program of six pre-selection games of Lakers.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly parties to prepare me," he said.
The time of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a radun crack.
This is the first five rounds for Trump next week, including stayed in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for its decision to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress at the November elections.
What will be Trump's commission now and how can you follow it online?
The Trump committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
It is possible to follow the Trump commission in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the subject of sexual violence charges with an advance confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a bit of tension.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five rounds in the coming week were meant to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans were trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," while in Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so determined by its programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are on the most committed stage of the campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the committee could call supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media," while in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the State where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in charge of investigations.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to push him into the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, while in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until Sunday alone
After three single sessions, Saturday afternoon's quarters could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The moto of the oscillating pendulum is a completely inventive sport concept in which players firmly believe and never as in cars like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I'll say we're keeping some engine," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points forward with other twelve in the game.
The Americans feel like having some wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to hope for, not from the last form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each takes three points on four.
Spieth was beaten by tea to green and is giving the example.
The party bells became more powerful than the next game, putting a crucial pot to compare the accounts to the four game, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His pontt that won them the game at the 15th floor was accepted with a similar noise, which tells you that he thinks the American team isn't out of the race yet.
"You must really care about your party," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 jumps to make a point.
The only players with more points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe are four to four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to shoot a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine o'clock Friday morning morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the clausso people consolidates the certainty that they are players of Sunday beat, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest any European win while the sun is going down on Le Golf National.
Preferredly both at the same time his different boots.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon reached Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have fucked up the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even managed long enough to lift.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe from a distance through the interactions between couples, the advice they give and that they don't give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, particularly the stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup after having completed the four-ball games and Saturdays with an advantage of 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the trophie lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has fought more in the forums, winning two parties, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single Sunday parties to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European runner to win four points of line while he and Molinari, known as "Mollwood" after a sensitive weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening parties in the story of Ryder Cup.
After they threw Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they worked beautifully to beat down a fallen Woods and American exordent Bryson Dechambeau with a much cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who crossed for two Saturday parties, showed occasional spree of genius but lost 19 of its 29 parties in fourballs and foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's fourballs, returned to the side of his partner Henrik Stenson in his foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and twenty-day south-west of Paris.
The three great winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two Saturday points.
They won a great victory 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursoms, losing the two opening holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup a team has been returned from a four-point drop to the individual, although the Furyk team needs only one pair to defend the trophie.
After the second best for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea has completely rejected unilateral disarmament without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions was expanding the country's confidence in the United States, which in these circumstances would have been absolutely refused to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has adopted "an important measure of good will" in the past year, such as the halting nuclear and missile tests, the decommissioning of the site for nuclear tests and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any answer from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security, and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used its comments on Washington's resistance to a "in-stage" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, its declaration was important because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed himself to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end-of-war agreement in 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to appeals to ease the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to "have a pre-nuclearization" and increase the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve their purpose in a coherent manner and to address the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us in trouble is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our trust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
The Minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the contrary of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point of death."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's General Assembly of the United Nations, when he said it was inevitable to point out the US territory with North Korea's missiles after "the President of Bad" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" committed to a suicide mission.
Prior to the United Nations Trump, which last year threatened to "disappear completely" North Korea, he retorted commending Kim for her courage in undertaking the course of disarmament, but said that it must be done much more and that the sanctions will remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline, saying that "if we want two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia state that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council yesterday that "the respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and determined denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to focus on the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri along with the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would have visited Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He was separated from Pyongyang in July by saying that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea he accused him of presenting "gangster requests."
North Korea was committed during a meeting this month with Moon to shut down a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "compliant measures."
He explained that Kim explained that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year urged all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing viral culture to study for whole-night caffeine-filled nights.
A university student noted that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came from me and said to me, 'Why is this only now, when I am last year?'
He said that no one had ever said anything about the importance of the dream, which impressed me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performances, as well as improve general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students were experiencing a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom room, where students can select coffee cups, teasings, ginastic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a serene routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, ictus, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of your choice of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride associated with "white night to study", he still said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping quite well and with a sound of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, explaining and adjustment should help to avoid intrusion because the lack of sleep leads to the brain in an indigestion mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who enrolled in the University of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after following one of his lessons last year in Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course surrounding the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all students who have graduated to follow a similar study program before they are enrolled in this competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a watch for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circular rhythm in tult, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol under Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression outside the house with Dolly Menga's bullet that took over Steven Gerard's dissertic team at a 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first win outside home from the triumph of 4-1 February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches by trainer leaving his team at eight points by the leaders running from the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga has marked seven minutes before the interval and a short training of Rangers is never seemed to be able to match.
While the Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, Livingston goes to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for a difference of goal.
And there could be further problems arriving for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently launched by the outside of the house.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team, which has quickly defeated Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, has chosen the usual training that has hit a point on Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team has focused its opponents on each turn.
The Rangers may have dominated for the possession of ball, but Livingston had better use of the ball at its disposal.
They would have been able to sign just two minutes later when Menga's first-time filtering tour sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the central champion broke out the occasion.
A punishment calculus in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only pull on the second floor.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hopeful than convinced in their game in rigorous areas.
Alfredo Morelos of course considered it necessary to see a burden on the decline of the fifteenth after a dispute with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice at the door in the first time but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly porter didn't worry about Lassana Coulibary's head wound and Ovie Ejaria's dirty shot.
Although the opening hole of Livingston at 34 minutes may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Once again the Rangers has failed to manage a foot planted in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerarrd acted during the interval replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact because the needle stuck a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly got kicked out of the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to track visitors exactly in the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who collected a long ball after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor was opposed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton has submitted a final request for strength after an outbreak with Jacobs but Thomson has denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that has made the device known as Geiger contactor.
A firm point of science since then, contactor Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those few credible scientists Cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger contactor, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these auriculars you can really feel the effects of atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Give me a little bit of hope now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days from his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their modification into the laboratory
So they can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and are then re-injected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her cancer disappear in the sheep for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient and their modification into the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein of many types of cancer called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promoted the growth of various types of tumors", including that in the inside, the sheep, the lungs and the colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "instructe" them how to hit tumor cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West runs into a pro-Trump diaribia wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was paid in the study during a Saturday Night Live score after a closed performance that was praised by US President Donald Trump and said he would have applied in 2020.
After he played his third night song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA ring, he started a fight against the Democrats and regained his support in Trump.
"Many times I'm talking to white people and they say to me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I'm worried about racism, I'd have gone from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene that featured Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star quoted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Commission against sexual violence charges by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the registration of the Philippines in the West has been charged on social media by comical Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock himself is trying to take around the West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his covert.
"They bulged me in the backstage.
They told me 'Don't go out with that tie.'
They've bulged me!
And so they told me I'm a marginalized" said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the summer place?" and he said "I'll wear Superman's coat because this means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments have generated fish at least twice by the public, and the members of the SNL's cast appear to be unharmed, said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "The study is a death silence."
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-trusted rapper Mac Miller was dead a few days ago.
West has detected many with a performance of the song I Love it, covered by Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for having kept this test to Mass."
But the director of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what is it and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") that I think is covering up a ridiculous ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously noted as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following the steps of Didy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the lost musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for reception in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was admitted to a restaurant in Belfast East Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackmore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to present himself to Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Ministry.
The Star of Tron of Spade Kit Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as combatant Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Spade.
But the 31-year actor attacked the male hero's stereotype, claiming that these on-screen floors often make the boys believe they must be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with the Co-star of Trono di Spade, 31 years old, has allowed himself to worry a lot about this problem.
'I personally worry, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, what makes boys think they should be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequal or such of Tron di Spade once the series ended next summer, saying that "he had finished with fields of battle and horses'.
Starting from November, Kit will play the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the history of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Tron di Spade.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose interpreted Ygrite, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the series of fantasy wins Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 in the custody of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China refers to an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these pathology, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have already been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of the new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of blood transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, as the Chinese health authorities have said during a conference in Yunnan province.
One year later, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual HIV transmission is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to problem management.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has taken over the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous bugs" and "cospiration theories".
On Saturday, the US Member has accused a member of his staff of publishing personal information from three United States senators on the pages of the Wikipedia of the legislators.
The democratic Member of Los Angeles said that statements have been promoted by opinionists and websites of "the extra-right area".
"Bugie, buggies and still explosive bugs" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include the addresses of the home and telephone numbers of the United States senators Lindsey Graham of the South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, released by an anonymous member of the Campidoglio during the hearing of an expert committee on sexual violence charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The flight of news occurred after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the post source has been associated with the Waters office and have provided information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This info-day charge is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been put to rest as a result of these false and intentional accusations, has not been in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This infodated charge is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticisms from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This shit's hot," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that he does not have the character to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
It shouldn't be provocative.
He must not question the reasons of the defendant.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seems to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the dictators of being too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a current candidate to destroy Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Greatly confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities and the forces of order of these trends.
"We will make the responsible ones disappear," he continued, "and they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review still hits the floor with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It is now used to look for references to Brexit in each new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action media, started in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The newborn.
Will the speedy auto-ironion on how far we're going to take be the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, incompetence Johnny English from the rubber face and eyes out of orbit has obtained his license to incriminate things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comical creation developed for countries of non-englophone film producers.
Obviously it is the shocking secret agent who despite his strange glamour pretences has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that kind that has contributed with a single note on the theme of Gloria's opening ceremony in London 2012.
This is a character originally based on a mysterious international traveler and man who once interpreted Atkinson into the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, which left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last Johnny English exit.
I like Johnny English that approaches the helicopter by wearing a medium-sized armament and the helmets are short-fledged against his helmet.
The gift of Atkinson for physical commedia is obvious, but the humor seems quite subdimensional and surprisingly superfluous, especially now that film brands like 007 and Mission are now offering the committee as an ingredient.
The Humour looks direct to children rather than adults and for me, the pazsche adventures of Johnny English are not as original and seen as the gays of the silent Atkinson movies when Mr. Bean interprets.
The premise of imputable news now is the fact that Great Britain is seriously dangerous.
An information hacker has infiltrated the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field, with the agent being charged, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the goose that works the weapon for a retired and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering from a tract of political impotence: Emma Thompson does his best with this character similar to Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
His intelligence consultants inform him that each active beach has been compromised and that he should call someone who has already retired.
And this means that poor Johnny English, who now works as a school director in a chic establishment, but also conducts lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some gag sympathies when English offers a school of Rock type spying course.
English is answered to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with its former partner Bough, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role as a girl of the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit frustrated.
So Batman and Robin of the disasters for His Majesty's secret services are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the first minister is at risk of falling into the network of the billions of charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the IT problems of Great Britain: left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their story of ridiculous adventures: dressed by cameras, they light the fire in a French restaurant; they throw the hell away by slowly introducing themselves on Volta's luxury yacht and English creates a pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take a dime with the house of Volta.
All scenes are certainly ideal for the last sequence, but since it's boring and exciting, there's a bit of TV for children throughout the story.
Everything's pretty modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't have done less to think: The British cinema industry could not assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to its talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be working on a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's labor party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, just being paid for five.
The party would like the principal companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an extra rest day.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, maintaining the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with the plans to target the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was assessed by the syndicates' Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the economy in development.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "At the end of the year the announcement of a revision of the political line is under way."
"It won't take one day to the other, but one working week of four days is an invitation in line with the approach of the party to the balance of the economy for the workers, as well as its industrial strategy together."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week under the general electoral campaign of 2017.
In any case, this ambition is not good at the time of the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party stated: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently a subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has taken advantage of the last week's labor conference to give particular attention to the vision of a socialist revolution in an economic field.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to buy power from "directors" and "explorers" in public services companies.
The shadow-cancellers plans also include that the current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package from the time the labor government can implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviour considered illegal.
It also confirmed the plans to include employees in business management councils and to create inclusive participation funds so as to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector‚Äôs net assets to employees, which end up in annual dividends up to ¬£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has sent the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the government agency can influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible that the FBI could bring them something to light to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was listening, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him as soon as it happened, which came out of the charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It was resolved, determined, inexhaustible."
Graham's vote, however, looks like he's stuck in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb test case," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she named couldn't prove it.
I've been 36 years.
I don't see anything else in exchange."
What is Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This New York Saturday will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable star career and has an equally cautious mission: ending poverty in the world.
On the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people reversing the Great Law of Central Park not only to enjoy performance such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, which will end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless it was willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But exactly how successful did the Global Citizen Festival now last 12 years to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a good way to persuade people to demand an appeal for action, or is it just another example of so-called "clictivism" - people who really feel the difference simply by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, operating for a variety of purposes.
He states that these actions have contributed to calling for global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first year of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements that have already been withdrawn or used as at least $10 billion funds.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on around 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives with headquarters in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children increase their potential" by offering Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a note on the page in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were implemented by the United Kingdom because it was better to feed mothers and children, the government announced the creation of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through food interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs present on his website, he asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and warm path - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartite movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon√©e are some of those who will be present this year in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use marine to implement "a block" and stop Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, "if necessary", appeal to its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has noted that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern slope of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to confront you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to operate a ship block so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the events hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take up financial burdens and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little reverse", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
Statements have been made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to enhance the export of its liquid natural gas in Europe, and to replace Russia, an option which is absolutely the most economic for European consumers.
To that end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the same President of the United States, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has more than once pointed out that North Stream 2, consumed by 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of that existing up to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Cremlin object that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply guided by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Minister of Energy Russa Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The United States' position has undermined the negative reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Point Organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the United States to remain out of the energy policies of the European Union and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see it as a big problem that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" to apply to the Presidency in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would take "serious account" of his election as president following the half-mandated elections.
In the course of a civil assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the possibility of applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our bad government in place, and that means having a woman to the top," he said, as reported in The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my request for president."
During the Warren City Assembly, he said his address to President Donald Trump, saying that he was "bringing this country into the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicitly critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's same voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
58 per cent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 per cent supported such an application.
The survey has been given greater support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other names of high-profile democracies discussed in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after she was recruited in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What is happening to my son, what is happening after being returned, I can relate to other families who experience the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers return with," he told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they become a little different, frustrated, wondering if there is such respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic aggression and violence against a woman, who interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under the influence of terrorists, according to Dan Bennettt, a spokesman of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 Columbia State and District Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Twenty states and the Colombian District support a legal battle against a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 States and the District of Colombia on Friday presented a friendly memory curial in Washington to support an asylum seeker who responded to this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the call for Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said his partner "and his violent sons of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
He was put in a state of lockdown in Texas.
The researchers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy highlighted a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to submit an asylum application for immigrants from domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law imposes that all claims for asylum are judged on the basis of the particular circumstances and circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle," says the memory of friend curiae.
In the memory, the prosecutors also pointed out that the policy to ban immigrants' income damages the United States economy, stating the net probability that these become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary manual work".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration not to guarantee asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, as part of the announcement of the political line.
The asylum has never been conceived to deal with every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people must face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the budget for the deaths of Raddoppie in the course to find survivors
For superstitions, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma, while comforting her little febrile child in an evacuation centre in the destruction city of Palu.
"There's always an ambulance that takes the bodies.
The clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, destroying their fraternal personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were injured.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, were the victim of a back and back fracture, and they stayed outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated abroad because of the continued serious absence of assistance.
His eyes filled with tears as he read the feeling from the violent earthquake that exploded the room that shared with his wife and daughter at the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I stayed out of the walls, I think," he referred to Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accused China of "proposing" with "public propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a publication of four pages on a U.S. newspaper, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
The United States last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere with the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
The case was raised by Trump, as regards the fact that Pechino was trying to join the US elections, noted that U.S. officials referred to Reuters as a new phase of a scale-up campaign in Washington's work to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish to promote trade, Pechino and Washington are currently involved in a trade war on scale which has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
The Chinese representative taxes at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to strike exporters in States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Pechino had damaged American workers, Canadians and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now increases those assumptions by publishing public advertising on our free journals."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is serving the American tradition of freedom of speech and print, placing a payment advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"Victerally, in the school on the road here in Pechino you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people might have on China's economic traction problem, as the media are under the firm opposition of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most daily signs of China has chosen the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspapers are.
The Republicans are taking the women's election before the half-mandated elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning the analysts
Since many Republicans of the point defend the name of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on its side in dealing with various sexual harassment charges, analysts have noted that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during future half-mandated elections.
The rise in this respect has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown their desire to proceed with a vote.
"You can't take these things off," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for a published article on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the strength of the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to place the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said the Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group.
On Friday morning the demonstrators repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate room, when the Republicans who control the judiciary decided to continue with the candidateship of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dott.sa Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already high; that's right.
But they could be higher, especially among the indeterminate electricians and young electors, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite the President's absence."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have been made if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For GOP has become a total confusion," Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote for the committee, the final one or whether Kavanaugh will be put in panic, it is also about how the Republicans have managed the situation and how they have dealt with it," said the news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select the Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be in some way divided between the person who believes in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favour of this last one.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the interviewees certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they had certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's intensities, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under an oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had settled him in the state of Hebrews when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court has married his genitals during a party during studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to revalidize with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee commented on the fact that the attempt behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, as John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make sure that Solid is accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff employed to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology programmers around the world will be able to live on their decentralised apps using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google if you enter or not a complete change where their business models are completely out of hand from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," adds Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Reminiscent of the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical church in England to be awarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in its hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant Colonel, Reverindo Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a witch and never knew he had attained the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, in Northamptonshire, its two nipots opened a memorial flag.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would have been opened for exactly 100 years from the premium produce of its grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battle along the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a thick cloud, under the heavy fire of the field and war machines".
Then he slipped to the fire line and with the "greater gallantia" he made progress before running with a single-hand cannon and landed three of the separation.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German circus on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can't ever be taller and something that makes him more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also moved a crown of flowers after the meal, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it really felt honored to discover a role in the preparation" and added "the value of a real error is shown by the support that many people give it."
The MMA fans have been on their feet all night looking at Bellator 206, and instead they've beat Peppa Pig
Just imagine, you've been awake all night looking at the famous Bellator 206 just to see you reject the view of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and had to be transferred to the United Kingdom during the night, directly on Channel 5.
On the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to leave, the spectators in the United Kingdom were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some were based after being awake until the first hours of the morning as soon as possible for the fight.
On Twitter a fan described the passage to cartoons animated for children as "a kind of fun of bad taste".
"The government's regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it had to go to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked to deliver it.
"Beep the apple," "Yes."
"The president of Bellator's company, Scott Cooker, said that they will work on programming to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," said Cooker.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you the next time it doesn't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to get so much for fans, and we've just discussed it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympicnotator Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24th year he said that he would not be taken into account until he got to secondary school, the fact that "not all are like me".
Speaking at the first point of the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, said she had heard her voice about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent had made it possible for the Olympics to be less important.
The representative of the old date programme, Kirsty Young, took part in a series of free months for disease.
Presenting as an emigrant in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less" to anyone else as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable for both boys and girls to like."
He said, "Today, the feeling of being less than, and feeling different, has been the things that really gave me strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had discovered his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics became an activist of the LGBT's high profile and used his face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he had heard his voice because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three times world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man - the US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "I felt surprised".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than he, last year, but said that age difference was never a problem.
"When you were so young," she went to her first Olympic when she was 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later - she said she had been hard to find any of the same age she had experienced similar high and low.
The two have become parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all-on-the-One" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about the fact that "I had to win a gold medal," she said.
"You know one thing, there are more important things of Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he wanted was whether there were tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'You won't be from these parts so you can be in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he disappeared from breathing and until he actually disappeared and died, I had not yet realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley graduated in the Olympics in 2012, winning the prize.
"I knew only that it was what I had dreamed of for my whole life - eating in front of a public house in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud of Heather Small - which had a particular meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him the skin of the ocean.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside shape of Mikkelson put in pancakes in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to return in order to avoid becoming an unhappy billionaire.
Mickelson, playing in the binary event for a twelve-time record, was put in a pancake by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes of the Sabbath.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has often been done for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day doing cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what he suffers.
Not being the strongest driver even at the top of his career, the 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the hidden path regularly punishes wrong crimes.
And if the path for himself wasn't quite discouraging enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the exact sample of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who worked with the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all and four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, of four points at the beginning of their 12 single matches, are born with a bulging start, the match of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my back, put me a hand around and said it would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk told.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and it's added so much to the teams last week, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way she went and this is the way we thought she should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mikkelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never even long reflected the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games, 20 defeats and seven pairs, although Furyk said his presence has brought insome goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, argut, it's like taking people's game, and it's a fantastic boy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have been having fun to bury themselves against him this week, something that has been fun to look at.
He did much more than play"
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a great resort.
The Danish started at the 1997 meeting in Valderama in which the team, captain of Seve Ballesteros, despite a distance of five points from the Americans, came to the line of descent with a minimum advantage, winning 1411‚ÅÑ2-131/2.
"Continually repeating to me that we had a good advantage in Valderama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6 at Le Golf National.
"That's why it'll be history to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you have to give the maximum.
You need to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It is not finished until the points are not marked in the washroom.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players in my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy of the way his people have raced in that difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I will never be overcome.
That tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're only your golfer's ability is tested hard.
This is the message you need to send to players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of you.
Then you forget about your friend because he must go there too and pull out the best of himself."
On the contrary to Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will look for the best individual performance in his players than the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parties at those large meetings on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start right away as we did in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain piece, the pressure increases in the middle parties.
That's why we organise our training of consequences and classify the kids in the way it seems appropriate for us, because tomorrow we'll try to make a magic.
Thomas was assigned to lead the controversial and facing Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was re-launched.
According to local media, the last German military Navy fleet should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be until next year because of defective systems and a cost commitment.
The Committee of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the ambership of the new Baden-W√ºrttemberg class cargoes, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the military Navy in 2014, but concerns arising from delivery have disturbed the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W√ºrttemberg class ships ordered by the military Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of ancient and anti-naive missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as low, infrared radar and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, which should be possible to use new brakes up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to design its own superpower, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The lucky F-125 guy made news last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Amburg.
It was the first time the military Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
It is known little about the reasons for the return, but the German media have noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that have made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as Baden-W√ºrttemberg class ships would be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
Moreover, it is urgent that the ship weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the first EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new cargoes become particularly important in the light of recent warnings regarding the reduction of German shipping power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy was "in fact lacking ships capable of being used".
The officer stated that the issue was significantly worse over time since the old disarmed ships were not replaced by new ships.
Its framework is that none of the bands of the Baden-W√ºrttemberg class could join the military Navy.
The National Trust mourns the secret life of the Pipistrels
New research carried out in a holding of the Scottish Highlands is aimed at discovering how the pills use the view to look for food.
It is believed that the findings can shed light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and suprano pipistrels, in addition to the brown ears and daubington pipistrels at Inverwe Gardens, in Western Ross.
Special registries will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of the pillars during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound recorded by a expert will determine the frequency and manner in which each species behaves.
They will then produce a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed framework on their scale of behaviour.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the protection of nature for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are more important for the pills and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of dishes, and how to better keep forests for fossil fuels and other related species.
The population of pistols in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the past century.
The pillars are at risk because of construction and development works that interest the three pillars and destroy the habitat.
Eoleic turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as the soft paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, in addition to domestic cats' attacks.
The pills aren't really hidden.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful to the eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the pillars very seriously.
Ten qualified experts conduct investigations regularly, inspect the thresholds and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even established the first reserve of Scotland for only the Pipistres at the custody of Thrave, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of the ten species of Pipistres of Scotland.
The holder's manager, David Thompson, says property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threve we have a wide area for the pills," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot on the pills we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
Stresses the importance of controlling the pills before conducting maintenance within the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother-travel can kill up to 400 women and young people, perhaps by means of an entire local population.
The pistols are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their trailers.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our pills, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape while the laws cause the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "will make themselves public" with his name.
His laws are prepared to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The young Portuguese attacker was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also took note of Friday's charge of 375.000 dollars to maintain silence over the accident.
In a video on Instagram directly to its 142 million followers, in the following hours of the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the fifth time Palone d'Oro turned to the video camera.
"They want to make themselves public through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the smiling footballer.
According to the Reuters, Ronaldo's laws are prepared to cause a case in Der Spiegel on the charges, defined as "an unacceptable signal of suspicion on the private sphere".
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will ask for a remedy for " Moral damage to the extent corresponding to the severity of the privacy violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The fact would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Casino Resort of Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be returned to the soccer room, where he had been subjected to anal violence, as reported in the statements lodged at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga argues that Ronaldo would have been in trouble after the accident saying to be for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents indicate that Ronaldo confirmed that they had had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensus.
Majorga also said that she was reported to the police and hospitals where her injuries were photographed, but then she agreed to a reconciliation agreement because she felt "trembling at returns" and worried about the prospect of "be publicly humiliated".
The 34th year is now seeking to reverse the agreement, maintaining that it is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to pass to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accident, and this state will join the Italian Youth with a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will always compensate for the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "may always fulfil" the loss of its world leader status in the construction of cars following Brexit, Minister of Industry Greg Clark said.
He added that he was " Concerned" for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible exit of Great Britain from the EU without an agreement and the subsequent temporary blockage of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car house claims that delays at the border, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
Burnaston's factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avenis were built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It raises concern in other English car manufacturers for EU exit without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for one month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the builders in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for vehicles on schedule.
If the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a delay in the border which would result in delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day of inventory value in its Derbyshire establishment, declared the company, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "expected with precision to avoid these border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will enable us not only to enjoy the present success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a chain of distribution of great success."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production could stop, but in the long term, warned that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the facilities and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that workers are very concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein could still be forwarded, says the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "remained for a week", while the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued on Sunday, said the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference with the elections, links between the councillors of Trump and Russia, and any obstacles to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could license the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus risking Mueller's independence, has fed Washington's bishop for months.
In the course of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a shirt to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and he shouted that he was going to die.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "no" would license Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an over-representation with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of instruction of the FBI's requests against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Sunday, the porter of Trump, Sarah Sanders, was shown on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has been no date, it could be this week, I think it will remain for another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll keep up to date."
Some journalists might answer this claim: Sanders does not have a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked you why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not due to an advert for TV journalists "which are shown," although he said, "I didn't agree with the fact that they are shown".
So she thought that direct contact between Trump and the print might be more frequent.
"The President has more sessions of Question and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without citing the evidence: "We checked the figures".
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better to talk to me.
We are trying to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown him the reason, making a free route speech, and at the same time a weird time, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Dutch NHS to express their concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scotia NHS to express the country's gratitude and to open up to them to stay after Brexit.
The honourable Member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the EU's exit from the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of fixed-term status requirements for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "For all the summer negotiations have been ongoing between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to decisions of autumn.
But the British Government has also prepared for a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation today for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU, and not only, bring precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was suddenly operated after a head wound
The Defender of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after bringing a head wound to the head in the Vanderbilt Commodores game, where the team lost from 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
The Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the border camp and he was beaten," Reed said.
The first relief workers and the medical staff have given Abercrombie the oxygen at the border camp before putting it in a barrel and carrying it along for further examinations.
A director of Tennessee State referred to Chris Harris of Nashville's WSMV, Tennessee, which Abercrombie performed surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there have not yet been news of the type and the entity of damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when it was wounded.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year, is at his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He had made a total of five pickles before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 picks.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the unemployed, according to the new workers' plans.
The management will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the tax rate will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to 120 million sterlines per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, it will now announce Theresa May.
The manoeuvre will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in taxation will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of impunity.
The surplus, which is added to the current bonus tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the property buy to lets (purchased to be rented), could be more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Interior provides that the manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million esters per year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for first-house buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become " cities of fantasy" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the State.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a piece of ball tax to help the younger ones with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by capping their land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the rates on affordable housing to system up the British "immobilisation."
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of exciting proposals for the reform of the housing market, including audits on rentals and the elimination of innocent waste.
He also wants to give the Council greater powers to build new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "I said last year that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, and that life should be better for the new generations.
And this means restoring the real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as it is for British workers living in the United Kingdom.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become too far and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My maximum ambition is to lead Scotland"
The Technical Director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum ambition" is to become first or then manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of re-establishing the North-East team that is currently in the third place in League One, at three points from the vet.
It is provided at the Stadium of Light after being led by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I've been in series B and this is all," Ross told the BBC Scottish Sports Sound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I have succeeded as a team manager."
Ross's predecessors at the Sunderland leadership were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Athletic Alloa technique maintains that there is no anxiety about following in such important names, in a rather important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me at this time is measured with the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Given the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll succeed only if I can get the team up."
The start of Ross's career was three years ago, after a period of training in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement of Hearts trainer.
He then helped Alloa escape from retrocession to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the time of retrocession to the title of championship champions, the next season.
Ross maintains that he feels much more about his action now than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It is probably a real point of reference," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really believed that the manager's role had been set up for me, more than that of the player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned a living and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
They still face stress and pressure at work, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct it and now I do it, I feel much more quiet than it's never been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a painting is 17:30 a.m.
The summer heat wave has brought more emphasis on English pubs in difficulty and more concern for restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants are worth 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consultancy company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the World has made it possible that the month of July followed a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit more severely.
The growth of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant in June is increased by July.
Pubs and bars in which perlopios drank were the most solid, with an increased homogenous increase above the level of restaurants.
Even the pubs in which they ate suffered the heat, although not too much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks are out of 6.6 per cent per month, while food consumption is low by three per cent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and recreational sector of RSM, said: "These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly severe in addition to the constant pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, from which we received in August, will give us a necessary guide."
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the fall of the brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and British restaurants collects and analyzes data on performances through 47 operating groups, with a combined factor of over 9 billion stars, and it is the industry's reference company.
A child on five owns a secret account of social networks that hides to parents
A survey reveals that a child on five, some of them only 11 years old, has the secret accounts of social networks that hide between parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content has been placed
The 20 percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show to parents.
A child on five, some of them only 11 years old, creates an account of social networks that has been hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the "fake on Instagram" account, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content has been placed.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "primary" account that they were forced to show to their parents, keeping a private at the same time.
A mother who found out about the girl's 13-year-old's secret site found a teenager who urged others to "trembling at me".
The research, of the Digital Awarenness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has shown that 40 percent of the boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed for private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the national general assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most beautiful Scottish athlete in the light sport and President Ian Beattie described the name as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the past decade.
"She enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletic could bring great benefits within the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I don't see the time to act as athletes' voices and I hope I can contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
The American winner of 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and four Olympic Gold Medagelli, as well as the current BBC opinionist, has found it impossible to follow a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had an ictus.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors only time could tell if I would be taken back and to what extent.
It was a huge job, but I got it all back, he learned to walk again, and today I am moving fast!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!".
The advertising of a Tiralette compares mothers and pigs and divides the opinion online
A company producing a Tiralette shared the opinion online with a publicity that compares mothers who climb and mucks who get up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and indisputable Tiralette", Elvie's consumer technology company has launched a publication in the form of a music video that shows freedom of expression as mothers given by the new Tiralette.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of dolls on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I take the milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these aren't motherfucking but my aunts."
The choir continues: "Throw him out, throw him out, throw him out of the children, throw him out, throw him out, throw him out, throw the milk to my lord."
However, the publicity published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has caused different reactions among viewers, many of whom have supported the "errors" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision is to use the bags to publish the product.
Like us, they must also stay strong and contribute to the production of milk, except for the fact that their little ones are stolen from them within a few days of their birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie Tiralette wears with discretion under a mother's registrant
Someone else commented: "Of course traumatic both for the mother and for the child.
But why don't you use them to publish a tape for mothers who will continue to have their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a meaningless publicity."
Others have defended him and a woman has even allowed to find the "fun" arm.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still up there, I'd like you to have one.
When I used the trigger, I felt like a bitch.
Publicity is a little confusing, but it's not very far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun publicity dedicated to mothers who use the toilet (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "much."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the household industry."
At the end, the video's protagonists show that they had danced with the discreet arrow in the registrant.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the Tiralette feel like pigs.
The Elvie Tiralette is, however, completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be stuck into an alley by giving women the freedom of movement, holding the children in hand and even coming out while they pull the milk out.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD, commented: "The Elvie Tiralette is such a revolutionary product that deserved a sharp and provocative launch.
Comparing women who use the scarrate to pigs we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily identifiable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyrant is able to ensure."
This is not the first time that the Elvie missile has made news.
During the week of London's fashion, the mother of two children introduced herself to the stylelist Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved into a tenttopia at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially, even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively varied, partly because the rhetorical burden and the political line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were, in fact, clandestine immigrants who are now afraid of repatriating the possibility of staying in the country by offering to undertake such a gesture.
The risk is increased in June when federal authorities announced that the trusted potentials and other adult members of their families would have been taken digital fingerprints and that data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been offered to take care of children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous penalties.
"About 80% of the people who are willing to take custody of children or belong to families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for which some of them will have to compare themselves in court within a month from the farm, instead of 60 days later, which was the previous standard period, as it says those who work at reception points.
Many will be compared to videoconference instead of person, in order to justify their legal status at a court of immigration.
Those who will be considered inappropriate for receiving assistance will be expelled soon.
The longer children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or refugee attempts, as they claim those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability that this is being verified is even higher in a large structure than that of Tornillo in which, because of its sizes, it is easier to ignore the signs of child abuse.
They add that the movement of children in the camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria is close to the U.S. occupying forces, French and Turkish to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has now ended in the eighth year.
Moulalem, who also took over the prime minister's task, said that foreign forces are dealing with the Syrian soil illegally with the temptation to fight terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moulalem stressed that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue "to fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "injecting unknown fears" that push refugees away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicalized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be granted in Syria until political agreement between Assad and opposition is reached to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a zone in Idlib, the most important rock block of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack on the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moulalem, however, stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Front al-Nusra associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be cut off".
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will be able to call on a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a draft constitution for Syria of the post-war war and prepare the road for elections.
Moualem explained the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by saying that the work of the group should be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution" without interference.
Why Trump will join the second mission
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may expect, its presidency should not conclude premature due to an impeachment or scandal.
What will undoubtedly be "the end of the most dramatic presidency of all time!"
At the moment, there are no flash signals from the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators on the first night, a decisive increase compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's nothing to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC television series "Designed Survivor" which tells the story of a member of the office who becomes temporarily president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The carman told him he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why does he laugh at me?"
The chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, Washington's strategy can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment if immigrant families can meet or less and the health status of the global economy.
To stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow up for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's deep research for his book "Paura", of Paul Manafort's leather jacket of 15,000 dollars ("a full suit" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the dissatisfying descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of the atomic parts of Trump.
For example, I'm no longer able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what seems to be a reality show is that there are news every evening," says Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pown Stars", about the occurrence of actors and daily developments of the Trump show (in contrast with N.F.L. that commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose an episode or stay behind.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sun with about 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and yet registered the CNN.
He couldn't stop by TV while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in front of the Supreme Court's immediate future.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outflow of money in the course for the most closed half-mandated elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the re-establishment of a congressional district which has done so that two members in charge are now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburgh's suburban district makes the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is above the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts the electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district course launched a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning a measure in the special March elections for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied by a republican over a decade ago and President Donald Trump added the district for 20 points.
Politicians have given democracies a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its idea
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Pechino, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather cordial meeting took place between the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and the president of Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners had forced the group of the Trump Organisation to leave.
The officials of the Department of State decided to re-enter the heads of American diplomatic missions by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said the spokesman of the Department of State Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million from the Americans for assistance in controlling drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visa granting, would have been of concern to the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployment and murder.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which has been seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading into the United States.
But in mid-September the senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference by giving up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been charged with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, stating the diplomats.
And the three American emissaries are returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further reprobation or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak in an anonymous way about internal decisions.
How many have been told was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who, however, wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study History
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of having been charged with obstructing justice, which seems to have enough evidence to prove it.
Standing at what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If the Congress had passed on to the Democrats, Trump should answer these charges before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his peers while preparing for a new candidate.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not the case with its counterparts in Europe.
In both Atlantic sponsors we should make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western Powers had shut it down and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we have failed to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that have followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the time must face different ones.
What would happen if Trump decided to license the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
The position of Rosenstein has been complicated since this paper has pointed out that last year it was secretly proposed to submit Trump to interviews by questioning his ability to recognize the role of the President.
Rosenstein argues that the news on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the expected allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to its actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to be prepared to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czech Hebrew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to get up on the Sabbath with the swastika.
With an heritage of the kind, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is excellent at meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing appearance against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them an excellent opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Even if due to an internship to the gynochio, the central champion Graham Dorrrans played his first game of the season right on the occasion of the 2-2 with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the thirty-first player.
"We faced the game that we agreed to do well and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremes but, of course, the comparison is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, there will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good outcome in the last game. But I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will be able not to give up.
The past year has certainly been difficult because of my internships and changes at the same club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation is going well.
We can therefore forget the problems of the past season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey had clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have faced the issue within the family.
About half of the respondents from Nationwide said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance sector of Nationwide, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of themselves, but they don't face this conversation".
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and children: you cannot prepare your family to help you if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determined for costs.
You will be involved in a financial consultant: you will be able to advise you how to pay the costs you will have to face.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a life insurance policy with a risk value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all the documents you need to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can monitor medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also assess the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions in your place and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine your old parent being rushed to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you can always be ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Man hit more than once with an air rifle stuck in Ilfracombe
A man was hit more than once with an air rifle caught while he fell on his feet after spending the night out.
The victim, a quarantiner, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "casual action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
It's not in danger of life, though, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Terreme and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The budget of the victims is intended to go away.
The communications are interrupted and the relief officers are unable to get any information from the Regency of Doghea, a area north of Palu which is close to the earthquake epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Doghara in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When he was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dothraa is a kingdom that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, accounted for about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Sulawesi Centrale and particularly of the coastal region of Dogh√≠a.
The extraction of nikkel is also an important activity in the province, but it is concentrated mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawei.
Palu and Doghaa have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dogh√≠a.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Dogh√≠a in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the symmetrical area of the Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: on 26 December a strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226 000 people, more than half of them.
2005: a series of earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern area of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing a tsunami that landed on the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra Westerne.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Isles of Mentawai, along Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a minor earthquake struck the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in the people who remembered the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there were no tsunamis but more than 100 people died under the massacres.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of which in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on the charge of aggression.
On the basis of a message issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for stopping the complaint and for resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged refusal, he cut off his phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility centre and its security was fixed at $500, as reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, it was shared in Saturday's trial and was declared "uncertainly innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree offences, i.e. detention up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
It was also written a second degree offence punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Justice of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the charge of crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His client accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and communications are not functioning and the victim's budget is intended to be paid in the next few days.
The earthquake struck along Sulawesi Centrale which is located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos showing the time of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a party on the beach in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors ask for the extraordinary capital penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
New York's federal prosecutors ask for the capital penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a home Depot rental van to climb on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for applying for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims "intensionally" and otherwise "intensionally" has caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the Court's document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Seven weeks after the attack, a major federal jury commissioned Saipov 22 imputation officers who included eight murder charges with criminal association, which were used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said describing how Saipov put it to the end as "atrocious, cruel and abusive".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov has caused harm, injuries and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
Ten years have passed since New York's southern district went after the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in the judgment, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to the ergastoll in September 2009.
The death sentence was carried out for the last time in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy by spying and convicted of having passed information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couples both died on the power plant on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court's documents, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police claim that the investigators were proud of what they did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to put an end to the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to extend the ISIS flag to his hospital room.
As regards the 22 heads of administration, they were declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was "of course disappointed" by the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt and the condemnation of the heretic without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Tory Parliament states that NIGEL FARGE should conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today has sworn to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When a member of the parliament of the Party of Theresa May suggested that he should be involved in negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the United Kingdom Party on Independence said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative Mr Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges May must face in order to try to reconcile its deeply divided party's positions have been underlined by the Torys who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The first minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing their efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to make it difficult for Eurosceptics and Laborers to choose between what May proposes and "caos".
At the organization's Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chechers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We'll be out of Europe by now," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I am for Brexit but we must leave the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for its opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought a world war to be a servant.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Good rejected the views that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Parliamentary Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the court and told journalists: "I just tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and will not be pleased with the interests of our party and our activists who turn for the streets hunting for votes in order to allow us to be elected.
Let me lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
In the Committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they intend to translate the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to translate Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let him."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to translate Brexit.
We are trying to mobilize the people's army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, those who prefer to stay in Europe have marked the streets of Birmingham before having a two-hour commission in the center of the city.
A demanding number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit's flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The laburist drew the conservators for the security problems they had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for unlimited borders and for trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a joke.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking of applying to the presidency.
Senator U.S. Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections he will think seriously if he applies to the presidency.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke about his future during a civil assembly in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, was asked to reelection in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was in the air for a while.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled.
A participant asked them if they wanted to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women are going to Washington to system the government and that means a woman will get the highest charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge's police, in Louisiana, told him that he had arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
Friday he had released a murder video asking for help to identify a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was hit and killed near the South University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gun wound to his head that caused his death," said chief of police Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde was intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime with a gun and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and held in a state of detention at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
Junior player of nearly two metres grew in Baton Rouge, the past season Sims has discussed 32 meetings of which 10 are held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas was qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely conditioned the race.
From the field, Bottas participates well by letting Hamilton defend himself against the attacks of Vettel in the first two rounds.
Vettel first stopped at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group code traffic, moving that could be decisive.
Mercedes supports the next round back in the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, passes it after some routine-a-route actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent him from crossing the inside by risking to finish out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen is from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So guide the race for most of the race without stopping to box for rubber change and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, you must make the stop tip at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds it is not possible to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which reaches a quarter.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked very well for the whole weekend and it was really nice to make me go through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first and second positions," said Hamilton.
A Deadly Example of Body Language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump called on Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistent support that he did not disclose the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused of attempted rape the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony made by the Ford before the Senate of Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in Senate proves that people are "mechanical, malicious and budgeted".
"What can happen and what's going on in the last days in Senate where people are angry, mixed, bad and budgeted" said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being disclosed and the responsible says "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't do it" added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the registration was transferred from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information recorded and I did."
But his silence is not credible to the president, who during the Sunday evening committee commented: "I see it, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President has suggested that democratics are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the mechanism, the punishment. They don't care who harms, who must pass over to recover power and control," said the President as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer signed two bullets for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the game of Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 Saturday return competition in Dundee.
The Giants immediately passed two rounds on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the team home to the couple before Dwyer brought the Giants in.
Francois Bouchard noted the comparison for the Dundee before two bullets of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen declared their victory.
It was the third failure of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men that Friday evening in Belfast had gone up and won the game with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times in this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer marked the first round at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a rather animated first time, Sullivan returned the home team at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquartt provided the partner of the match to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ordered the advantage for the Giants by marking the second round of the evening at the end of the first time.
The house team returned and Bouchard restored the match after a strategic manoeuvre at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which took the Dundee for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and ordered the victory of his team by marking the fifth round in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, which have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next game home to Milton Keynes on Friday.
Death flight controller to allow hundreds of passengers to escape to the ground
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to decelerate in order to save them.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong silences of assistance continue to interest the area, and many are trapped between the massacres in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the Windward Anthony Gunawan Agung remained in his position at the Mutaria Sis Al Jufri airport control tower, which was sadly on its way to Palu.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, managed to land safely.
So she was hit by the control tower when she thought she was gonna crawl.
He died later at the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian issuer ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikipan in Kalimantan to transport it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster anti-corruption agency will know that access to the cities of Doghana, Sigi and Butung is limited.
"The count of deaths is meant to increase because many bodies are still under the macaroni and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Where up to 6 metres have destroyed Palu, where Sunday a mass burial will be performed.
Military and commercial fleets are transporting aid and survivors.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance transports bodies.
The clean water's gone.
The minimarkets are hidden everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to finish all the occupation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by the CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is a dispersion after the accident of the lake
The flight company that landed in the Pacific Lake in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 passengers and crew members were able to save themselves, he now claims there is a dispersion.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing on the call.
The airline has confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further passenger requests, such as age or nationality.
Local ships allowed other passengers and crew to escape after the accident while the aircraft was trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
According to official sources, on Friday seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers were recovered at the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the incident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The U.S. Air Company and Marine maintains that the plane is precipitated in the lake because it has not reached the track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane has reached a very low quota.
"And it was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the air's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants had been taken from the panic and ran and that he had been slightly hit by the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some mariners who were working near the shores to set up a bridge have provided relief by using a rubber to transport people on the river before the plane landed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died of plane accidents on the lines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday the trial was completed in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to rebuild the movement of the accused Quinton Tellis and the victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had recovered the location data of several cell phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during which he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford presented himself in a Saturday court and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis told the truth by saying that that night was in Sanford's truck, this man confirmed that he was "in the lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies are the fact that Tellis claimed to meet Chambers for two weeks when he died.
Cell data indicate that they were known only for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed from his phone the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers.
"He canceled it from his life," said Hale.
The defence will begin its final debate on Sunday.
The Court of Justice shall provide that the court shall proceed to the jury at the latest on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the sensitive hip-hop?
A three hip-hop wants to challenge the negative view of the gender by inserting positive messages into its tools.
The High Breed group, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has been separated from its origins when it spread political messages and reported social problems.
They want to go back to their origins and make a kind of sensitive hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons have recently returned to the United Kingdom thanks to such characters as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York's father named a couple in court for licenseing her with a "racist" text
In New York a father quoted a couple in court for having discriminated against after having received a text that the mother regretted that it was "other black".
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the request to a real and own "storation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that his new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first working day in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after taking account of the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrated" licensed Ms. Maurice saying she was not pleased with their previous father, an Afro-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Mrs Maurice's workday and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to be licensed, asks for a rediscoverment for the beauty of $350 per day for six months of full-time work for which she was initially taken, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post, adding "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple replied to the racist charge saying that Maurice's license was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after she got sick.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist" said Joel Plasco's husband at Post.
"Will you trust your children to a person you've been kidnapped with, even if it's a mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real and its "storsion", Plasco stated that the wife has been separated for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"We can't get along with someone like this.
It's not a very nice behavior," added the financial consultant.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of the public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on social media and strongly criticized them for their behaviour and the following logic.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared that readers would not appreciate a talker
Bond‚Äôs daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: ‚ÄúIt is not easy to put into the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
By saying that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a playtable orchestra, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a little "dear" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a prisonlike person," she says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved as if you had a child that would reach a trap: I'm proud of you even if it wasn't for you.
I think I'd interpret Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
At the landing, the daughter was rushed to Nizza Louis Pasteur's hospital 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called me to tell me he'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to tell him goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I want you so good.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given them to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly increasing.
She died a little while ago and it was over.
I had to sit down and wait knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to deal with it."
In the end, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who was devastated by the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with other strangers than what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"For all the time I did nothing but cry at low head.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought I needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two-year-old women's tickets to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have committed suicide commit themselves to preventing others from committing the same act.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hit a bridge in Wales with motivated messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and died at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, relates that his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew it for his smile.
They always said he was lighting every room in which he stopped."
But before he died he left work because depression had led him to "a really empty place".
In 2014, Tyler‚Äôs brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid you're having a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
The Humphreys, who's been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you felt too depressed or depressed," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that her attitude had changed.
The day of Christmas touched the background. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking at them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to work on: "The family was sick.
He made us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has started investigations
"I think that if we could proceed as he asked, i.e. with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Fleke said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Commission itself "lost peace" because of the blockade of radical supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks are left for the half-mandated elections on 6 November. If the Republicans as planned will have a negative result, they will be very weak in their attempt to choose the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
He will vote in Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to break the inductions and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's political refugees "down" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un was taken to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data of the South Korean Ministry of Unity, states that refugees were 1.127 last year against 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a more stringent border control between North Korea and China and the highest rates of illegal exit.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
To the vast majority of North Korean refugees, South Korean citizenship is finally offered.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and will often return them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearization that are in a state of state.
After this historic June meeting between the presidents of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised US sanctions for lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament for the first time," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "sterico" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "sterico" and states that it is not naturally appropriate to cover this burden.
The Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had behaved the same way, she would have defined her as strict," said the Pelosi about the statement made by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Apparently excited Kavanaugh denied the charge that she had sexually abused Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much to arrive almost to scream and with the narrow throat from the plant while talking about his family and the years at higher school.
He also explicitly condemned the democratic members of the committee who defined the charges against him as an "associated and coordinated diffamatory campaign" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
The Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown himself to be prevented from being democratic.
"I think you've been self-exclusive with your statements and the way you talked about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
The Pelosi then raised an objection when they were asked whether he would try to put Kavanaugh in charge if it was confirmed and whether the democratics should reach the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I think that if it does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that is currently in office," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Columbia.
The Pelosi added that as a democratic, it is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intention to breach certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosi stated that "No party and party can be sent to the Supreme Court and wish this decision to be accepted in a positive manner".
And women must use it.
It's a right diet, months and years of angry attacks that can't go out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "It really helped me a woman who was leading some way. She told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and began to cry she said to the person she was talking to."You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought her was a brilliant idea."
The tears are tolerated as a result of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the most recent memories I have of a previous job in a men's prevalence office is that once I was sent to cry for an access to anger. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from which I was always slightly frightened took me for the slaughter and walked along the stairs.
"Don't let me see you crying," she told me.
"I don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and I'm happy because they're hurting you."

In 1987, when a ship called Monkey Business discovered Hart's extraordinary report that you had to give up at the race, the Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried to apply for the presidency.
"In fact, it wasn't a well-balanced decision," she told me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and there was no one else to serve.
Someone defined "Biancanave and the seven teeth."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the fund collection and I swear he wouldn't have applied if he hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the beginning.
I found out that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 to her would have only 250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he cried.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not have launched an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thanks to the people who had supported him, disappointment to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters who represented and angry about the sexual discrimination he was a victim), which he was moved away.
"It seemed like I was getting into a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder, thinking about the print reaction.
"Someone could have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would have written about my stone.
Maybe "So much money."
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Pechino
The opening of the war between the United States and China has been frustrating and while the battle is all the more final, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scaling took place this week with the new taxes on goods for over 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros) of value. This means that half of Chinese goods will be applied.
Pechin has always responded with measures of the same type applying recent doses from five to ten per cent to 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has promised to respond to US attacks on the strike and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power of the world will soon face back.
Because Washington rejects you, he would have to give up his demands, but he would be too angry for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Pechino plays his cards well, the pressures of trade war with the United States can affect China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic group in both countries is much more dangerous than it has been recognised so far," says a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "pretty" for the return of refugees, supported by the Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the return of refugees and is looking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the last seven years of war.
In front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem stated that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees in the country who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have influenced their daily life and their support.
According to the United Nations estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who still live in Syria need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid subject to conditions or by those countries which supported the rise.
Europe wins victory at the ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by baptizing the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on the European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has recovered the trophie when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points that served to defeat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the 6th floor of Par 3 and gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist has distinguished himself in all his tournaments by becoming one of the four players to always make a 5-0-0 registration since the tournament with the current formula was first debated in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the category Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, was arrested for 2&1 in English by Ian Poulter who might have argued his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia, who argued eight, became the European player who won more than in the tournament history with 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry but today I can't do it.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm glad I recovered my coat.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his national John Ram who beat the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in Sunday's singles.
"If I think I've grown up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beat Tiger Woods," said the twentieth-century Rahm.
Woods lost all and four of his parties in France and now the count of his encounters in Ryder Cup is 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A statistical surprise if you think it's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team has been looking all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a delegation of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the European team.
We knocked on this occasion.
You're filling up with Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All his 12 players were very well behaved.
We'll reorganize ourselves. I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I'm in love with these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
That's what we put it all on.
But they played better than us."
