European inflation has deteriorated in food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the expected increase in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - was announced by the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
The official projections were only about 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the North American, British and Canadian embankments banks, did not reduce the basic interest, provided that the reduction, together with the increase in prices in raw materials and the reduction of forced steel, would lead to inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is found in box 22: "You have to negotiate" on inflation so that it will not have to intervene on this issue later.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, broke the record for 12 years; while Spain increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of food and energy price fluctuations.
The rate of the wheat has increased by 88 per cent and soybean tariff has reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, it had to pay much more in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 per cent, reaching the black gold nearly $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will now drop from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, and by 2009 it will now fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 per cent, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long delay, for early December the support of the Youth League of Democrats has increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup has never experienced such a low level - a 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' safe voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition voters - would mean support for more than two thirds (one 71 per cent) against the support of a fifth party for socialists (about 20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary threshold for some parliamentary scene: their support within the entire population is of 2 per cent.
Among the safe voters there is one hundred more sympathy in both bands.
The economic environment has continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point - it has never been so high, a 41 per cent proportion of those who have judged particularly poor the country's economic situation, while another 46 per cent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most promising expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimists about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the coming year, the majority of the population are experiencing the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth of the population expects an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was doing better than his functions.
The 13 per cent of the consultants trust or trust very much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Victor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population does not fully trust the Head of Government and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Alliance for Democratic Youth.
One of the indicators for the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the perceived dissatisfaction with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While some 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to remain in power to the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion is currently only about 20 per cent, while the relative majority (one 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the reference is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents responded to the question of participation and 20 per cent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparably, "a general election to be held on this Sunday" would surely only 55 per cent of the population and 15 per cent would likely believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
An 74 per cent of the population would refuse to pay for the study rights, 79 per cent for the medical consultation service and 84 per cent for hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would refuse to introduce study rights, medical consultations and hospital care.
The dearest is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices
The average price increase was maintained by 16 per cent of Budaörs' trade gold triangular hypermarkets, with the difference that this year's VAT has not increased.
Article of the Napi Economy
This year also increased in an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs' gold trade triangle the usual Napi newspaper shipping canast, but in all hypermarkets a very higher growth than thousands of HUFs was recorded.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared" as a percentage of the price was not experienced in comparison with the high starting point.
However, it is clearly a threat to consumers that what they could buy last year at a very low price under the nine thousand HUF, they cannot do it today or even ten thousand.
The Napi canast in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of 10 thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest-value canvas was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that canasta cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum liqueur and the fish was almost maintained at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase in the pechua phyte of strawberries, nuts and apple seeds was recorded.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
The competition does not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two litres of redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, including the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's canast was the most beautiful, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi canal.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canast last year with that of the cheapest canast this year, the difference has been 12 percent, whereas the growth between the cheapest of the previous year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during the Christmas last year prices felt the increase in VAT.
This process was just what destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important advantage on the margin adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi canal reached such extremes as the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF at the recorded value in 2006, while the cheapest difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, as the highest price since now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest one has also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two marine seasons, a catastrophic increase in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 per cent the price of first-time consumer goods.
( However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded a price increase of over 30 per cent over 12 months.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi cannasta, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, since at the price of this product that was quite expensive last year compared to the base, it was recorded, at the worst of the cases, only 10 per cent of price increases.
According to all the indexes, Harina suppliers have a stronger position than those of eggs, which could impose drastic increases in prices even to multinationals.
The hypermarketers do not complain about the gold trade triangle, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experience, most of the consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
From all products they buy large quantities, carrying preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of the Wednesday morning, large chairs were formed in the three shops in front of the boxes because there was a sudden increase in the number of customers.
However, we have information that sales volumes are lower within the country, many multinationals complain to the research institutes because income is under their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the electro-homes.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections were first reported in hospitals due to the inappropriate application of antibiotics.
Reinforced medical conditions in hospitals, bed drying and staff overload do not favour the control of infections - says the medical department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is even saved with disinfectants.
Not long ago an MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the hospital’s department of traumatology.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
An injury of a serious car accident was attributed to him from the hospital, and the same patient soon thereafter had to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then no significant surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December this year, the National Nosocomials Monitoring System recorded 1094 cases of multiple-resistant hospital infections - said Karolina Böröcz, head of department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections caused by multi-resistance agents has been recorded in hospitals with full safety.
Nearly two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacilin.
A third of the human beings carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
SA infections (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of the wound) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once it is applied excessively or inappropriately to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are converted into highly resistant bacteria to antibiotics and rapidly infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
Severe hospital infections, such as injuries or septicaemia, may first cause infections in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened body, in adults or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the physician-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotics Resistance
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff attend to rubber and mask gloves and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even so can the infection be avoided in all cases.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital conditions do not favour prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes of elders, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA in their body.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, it is not possible to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Caja does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come to public light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - the medical director of the department of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat pathological infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be undertaken in such a way that microbiological examinations should be conducted to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The use of microbiological samples is even less common in the case of ambulance patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of cats and direct contact between persons, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In addition, hospital rooms often are covered, beds are often very close, although patients should be separated for at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in less favourable economic conditions hospitals are protected from infectious diseases, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are registered or the infection of the pathogen agent may be stopped.
Government programme against MSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expenditure for the National Health Insurance Fund, which is why all countries are fighting it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MSA.
According to the data provided, MRSA infections appear to be successful in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistance agents (MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official emergency report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander XXII.
It can be excluded from the possibility that he had been driving Hebrew or state-of-the-art, since then abandoned by the district police commander XXII, who died on Tuesday and caused the death of a transundancy - reported on Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the General Prosecutor General of the Capital, after the dangerous report had been prepared on the case.
The dangerous report confirmed the results of primary alcohol control that he had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before leaving the flight.
The chief then of the district police commission of XXII, the morning with his particular vehicle on the Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the area designated for petons.
(This last fact, i.e., that the bridge did not use the brain to cross the road, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not an austerity situation, the driver must always take the step to double.)
The survivor lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police report, because he was moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morva also said that the former police commander had been working with the prosecutor’s office since the beginning.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit-limited agreements for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget projects for transport and environmental protection, which will be implemented from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract which they had just signed referred to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has adopted a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken at the latest by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which will mainly be used by the budget for the Debrecen University's project of innovation and research.
During the discussions they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that for Hungary to last with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro would again address the issue whether or not the original contract should be amended and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place early in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest in credit is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period without charge for maintaining the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who are buying on the EU's cheaper market, will it focus quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sun", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estates around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, late or early the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia can be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, which could be such a great destination during the other two stations, in addition to summer and winter.
Thus, the predicted investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of the analysts, who buy real estate in Bulgaria, they also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the landscapes.
Foreign clients can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated furniture at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100 000 or old houses in bad condition between EUR 5 and EUR 15 000 to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, as well as the importance of the proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
The second category is the purchasers of chalets (Bulgaria was included in the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of obtaining medium or long-term benefits.
The price of the real estates continues to grow, as demand is growing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent
The increase in the price of real estate is significantly greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue negotiations at the ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap, which is available on the subsequent efforts to reduce emissions, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which will continue until 2012.
There are currently encouraged discussions on particularly between developing and industrialised countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate accurate figures at the moment, although it tends to reach agreement that compared with the 1990 situation, by 2020, the emissions of greenhouse gases decreased by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on assistance to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by an integrated management board of 16 members, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes "Piac is Benefit".
The six hundred from Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role of vanguard in global climate protection and to promote the signature of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 2020 to 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 1990, regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to compromise even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol had committed themselves to a decrease of 5.2 per cent, and 15 EU Member States therefore had committed themselves to achieving 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 per cent between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - indicates the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is very much in play in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be delayed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, which was needed in its most recent report by the UNICC, an international scientific association dealing with climate change, which had received the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emissions reduction would suffer a delay and would not prevent an increase in earth's average temperature of more than 2 C, which scientists believe would have inevitable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
The units of the British army in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) was the first to use YouTube services: the special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on caskets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations and then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers who have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "headquarterers" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the United Kingdom Office and the international forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence also served to present to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda is practically nothing compared to conventional television spots of recruitment - told BBC the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - in exchange, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the right to be of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the rapidly edited and censored recordings, in the distributor there are also popular videos about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films a bit of hypocritics, officials speak as a maximum of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos have already been posted in real operations from the Iraqi and Afghan battle camps, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with shots, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which the player can be directly replaced by soldiers in the middle of a more or less real situation.
Tombola and salad pastel at the Ministry's Christmas party
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem very sensitive: instead of the wedding party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to leave in 2007 with salted pastel and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, on the other hand they will create a navigable atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tone and a brandy.
Festival, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - so enjoy power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the staff of the Ministry.
In the Hierfan Navy, the children of the lost soldiers will receive gifts and for the Missionary Navigation family members who are currently carrying out missions abroad will also be invited to receive a press reception.
This paper will devote 25 million to the festival environment at the end of the year.
The National Agency for the Promotion (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a lullusive party with regard to other paper parties
The MET festival will be held in the Future House, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred staff members of the ministry are expected to be in attendance at approximately thirty-five.
At the party of the concert there will be an environment of Christmas, artists will also act and there will be a lot of trouble.
The NAFA's fleet was 4,700,000 HUFs and Wednesdays were held in the building of the National Council for Justice (CNAJ) with musical and dinner concerts.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, and the rest of the budget was spent for over four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the AGF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
To this end they rented the complete building of the Theatro de la Commedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we cannot communicate with the person concerned.
Can attend without a thread
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANFO party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of the Navy celebrated Lucía's dance on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not cover any use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The festival began with the words of the minister's greeting and after the dinner there was a live dancing music.
In response to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance was not mandatory to wear clothes or night clothing.
The health, work and local administration papers are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its staff in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official sailing party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
The participation of hundreds of eight guests who - as the press department will inform the press department - will take only coffee and salad pastel, so that the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply offer his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development Hall.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a navigation party in its own action hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The wedding party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget will pay for the reception with buffet and a gift.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the contrary, there will be no festival atmosphere, the official nature will be given not only by the ministerial talk but also by the time of the evening of its celebration.
The Agricultural Charter will offer a New Year's reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be celebrated in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the paper, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for hundreds of guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception of foot, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short ministerial speech and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the relevant press departments reported to [originally].
In the Department of Press of the Environment Charter, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's navigational events.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Works Commissions will be a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike of the moon that will last for an indefinite time.
The Saturday will be held a protest mitten, while the Monday - the day on which the final vote on public health law will be held - the working party will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will be completely stopped and until 13 hours workers from Budapest's collective transport company will also be on strike.
In the evening of Friday, the League's trade unions will report on the details of their moon strike that will be held together with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
It will also be the LIGA and the National Federation of Engineers who will coordinate the actions of the moon.
The Saturday will be held a protest mitten, while the participating trade unions will be pronounced in an indefinite time strike if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of Parliamentary vote on public health law, they did not report on the date of the strike.
If the National Assembly deplores public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
Instead, if the law is approved, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda for the month of the National Assembly, it is also possible that such a vote is only on the public health law at very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: the railways will stop working for an indefinite time, some of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volan companies can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, in many parts of the country there will be close to half the road.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike at an indefinite time, others at a certain time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as Christmas celebrations are approached, they are increasingly the people who travel by train.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to the 13th hour, the Workers of the Competitive Transport Company in Budapest, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike at the LIGA Trade and Energy Union, the Educators Unions called for 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be held nationally at alternative hours and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Syndical Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour notice.
The most important of the four requests made by the League is that the Government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second request is to gradually introduce the new form of calculation of the pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is that they will ensure, even before 2010, that advanced pensions are able to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions do not accept the Ministry of Economics and Transport proposal on railway side lines and wait for another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country, the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which is in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased from a number of points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "warning warning" it is written that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the increase in ethnic tensions between the Gitana and non-Gitana population, even in the short term, there can be violent ethnic confrontations".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the result of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They said that this was due to one of the major shortcomings of Hungarian political life protagonists: " public life protagonists gave him the public debate on the guitar problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their policy strategy on existing discrepancies between guitars and Hungarians".
This raises the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the establishment of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006, there has been increased publicity and the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been established in the country which are self-defenced by "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defenced as civil organizations, while they openly declare the training of their members for defence - including weapons - (civil defence, national defence, public order defense), which calls for the inceptibility of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They said that all of this was done in accordance with the method of trying to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association in the case of these associations is not only to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the extra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungary policy with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Institute of Research, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Central and Eastern European countries, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar manner as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the right-hand side.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defence".
In his view, in the last 17 years there has been "gitan terror" in Bulgaria, but the State has remained impotenced and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations indicated that certain guitar organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungary's Gitans also respond to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
The Research Director of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász, on the question of the news agency, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect the risk change, they inform the public of their opinion, as in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines exactly the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that is about the holiday days - that the coming year will be less - workdays are reorganised.
Not even in the EU or North America, the parties are united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, State party and festival days.
Festivals are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festival - this last of all so that those who have passed through the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven written festivals with red numbers in the calendar.
It is nationally celebrated on 15 March in memory of the 1848 Revolution and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August we celebrated the establishment of the State, on 1 May the work party, on 1 and 2 November we recalled our family members and friends who were missing.
In addition, in our country there are two days' Easter of the Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our national, national or religious festivals do not usually coincide with a weekend end, so they are often celebrated when there is only one working day before or after the festival.
In exchange for the extended weekends, you cannot be absent from work or school during the previous weeks.
He is the Minister of Labour who rules in his specific decree when it is necessary to work in place of the day immediately before or after the festival.
This legal rule is mandatory compliance for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions to work continuously, even during the festival days.
This year's work order can only be changed around the end of the year's holidays: from 24 December it is practically stopped in the country, as most people have been “put on” during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days, according to experience.
The next year several of our parties will match the averages or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be changed around the work party so that workers can rest within four days.
On Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day, so that Friday, 2 May, will be a festival day.
The other change relates to the 23rd October festival: Saturday, 18 October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the end of the year will be allowed to rest, since from 24 December it will not work in almost any part of the year, even if the last day of the year is Wednesday.
Six little inconsistency to hurt your colleagues' lives
E-mails we forgot to send, sound messages we've never received, innocent lies that we've been ignored: they're all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the minor problems or to avoid sensitive situations that may upset others.
Councils.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that you've been looking for the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
Why didn't you go to a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to fix the matter, call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by asking for forgiveness.
Before you go to oral explanations, it is worth meditating on the things you can harm your colleagues' lives and consciously try to avoid them.
You take something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
You remember you put the tape recorder on the table yesterday, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost biography at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't leave anything to your friends without asking them, 'cause they'll rightly be mad at you for taking away their things.
Do not cook above or after-it at the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before time.
Chismes about your colleagues' private life?
There's no good way to stop noises that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who's with?
Where and why?
Don't give everyone the information (conjections) you have about your colleagues' private life!
Don't abuse your friend's trust when you share your closest secrets!
You will understand in yourself what you have heard and not chisme about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you going to be licensed for illness unjustly?
When you call the office by phone and say you're sick and you're impatiently sorry for your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that day you prefer to relax; you think that others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work by term.
Don't ask your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something will happen to you, so you'll have to stay home, communicate with them, so your colleagues or your boss don't have to face you the next day.
Tarares, risitates, telephone calls
You're stuck in your job, but you're busted out of it by the risks of your colleagues?
Have you heard an involuntary phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to her?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarares, songs, high voice conversations (less when you do them above your head), patels, constant blasphems, expressing your discomforts in high voice.
All of these may be disturbed, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't jump into any chaos coming back to the office, nor to the noise your fellows are making!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that damages others and you must repair the missing!
Ask how you can fix your missing!
Are you feeling too much at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: I'm very comfortable for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging though your occupation allows it!
Don't be upset, respect your colleagues and yourself watching everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
Loss of interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car slowly advances in the usual beside the morning.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violent with electronic effects.
Put the volume down.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones are added to the bottom and then the voice of a female choir as a true joy intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love of Zagar song.
National music life didn't bother us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems quite different this job when you're listening to Zagar's new disc.
Looks Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the subground [b2]digital [b3]national little bit are changing the image and even though it's fashionable rock style garage, guitar break, national pop electricity has demonstrated: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zzezer started his career in the city of Pécs, he played around Yonderboi until he started his independent career maybe because they can't both be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, ballable electronic music and pop, he tried to triunfar when he was asked for soundtracks [b4] cinematographics (p.
Ferenc Török Sezon).
The wider audience knew the whole that in principle only acted in small clubs when the magazine van2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national discs, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trainer of trends, able to sell in the Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they take this label.
The group reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The disc has recently been released, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zzöder.
It is well the reference to the atmosphere, the flight, but in addition to the noise of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the age - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the disc in the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who is currently working in England with The Puzzle set.
The disc includes a true success of the mr2 Petāfi channel that lasts from the morning to the popular music night. This station led to the radioers' ears the high-fly music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
It's all right (?).
hvg.hu questioned the Balázs Zzzoder.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: What are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a chosen audience?
Balázs Zzözer: The definition of the selected public for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
So-called subterranean alternative music can also be boring, without meaning and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign country, especially in the western part of us, light music has larger traditions.
There, not only the generation of fifteen and twenty years, performers, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that take place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many are the people who listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I'm glad to see more people attend our concerts every time.
But we've never made music for the market.
We don't make music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is best felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the unconcealed changes of the moment.
And yet I realize that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you will lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made his career better to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We better work together, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, since many of us started our career in its group and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: The success list of Mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to the name of Zagar in connection with this song.
Do you open with this style consciously towards a larger layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell these with our record.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound organ of the disc and the most heavy subjects.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir in the Gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the sound soloists of our own national musical stage.
So it was created that choir of six women - whether Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who then was baptized as the Divines of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make exactly the song or the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The deal attracted the song.
That night I still recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and in the disc it seems as if the girls were on second floor.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn't just follow their songs.
Also in the scenario are located in the background.
Intently?
B.Zs: They're in the bottom just because of technical problems.
On the contrary, we deliberately did not want to distribute solar paper.
The song also reads about it, about which we forget a bit of our ego, who comes from where it comes and where it goes, because those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What other work have you dedicated to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to no one, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work the big one and then, a little bit of everything was put at his place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "normalized" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A trajectory of bees risking thousands of millions of dollars for its inferiority complex
A malicious traitor.
So it is as she pointed out to her former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the famous French banker of General Society, also owned by the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, of course, with good abilities.
It was long ago that, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He has a weak character" was left to hear of his superiors, the same who sent him to the police.
But what is learned from Kerviel's answers is that the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, were about a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than EUR 1,600 million because of his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Exactly this summer, he managed to win over the US crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity has already come at the beginning of the year.
In February some news about the so-called low-income mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did it right.
And then, at the end of the year, its gains exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I got my first 500 million I don't know how to notify," Kerviel confides and adds, that nothing has ever been left for him, absolutely.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had been misinformed by the records so that he did not arrive at his discovery.
Even when the Eurex Bolsa began to take an interest in her business, she came to deceive the bosses.
The risk was turned into a benefit
Was he afraid he'd come to find out?
Well, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position it should work gradually.
He entered the General Society in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Its annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant to the Bolsa racer, and in 2005 he became a boxer with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still I knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I had already noticed that they were watching me carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a €500 million title.
And this was supposed to be a start mechanism, and I wanted more.
If that's what you want, let's leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they'd rather suspect it.
"As soon as I got money, my eyes were closed."
Only then came the attack at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the end of the week to mid-January I wanted to delete all the eggs.
When the moon came to work, I didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros for its debt.
And how could they locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacations.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
The runner who has no vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his shipper" finished Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes for which the Czech Republic can earn EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion).
This is practically half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, some 125 billion crowns will be issued for the regions.
Czech companies can obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be allocated to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures which will next year amount to $90.800 million.
The Business and Innovation Programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies for the acquisition of business innovation resources.
Companies should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly imported countries that do not use them.
Twenty-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua, ruled by the Court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal decreed the 20-year sentence for the country's representative, Arnoldo Alemán, which was sentenced in 2003 to a loss of $100 billion (approximately $1,800 million).
Nevertheless, some time later he was released from prison to go to domestic detention in his factory not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
There is nothing clear at these times, according to the AP agency, that then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back to being among kings.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez will be better dependent on prison officials if they let Germany end their imprisonment at home or if they return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Germany constantly transferred government money to a company in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest family members and partners.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That is how we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year has already been approved with the support of ČSSD, as it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that it could not be allowed to refuse to accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote on the vote on trust to the Government, this time there was nothing dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view, while most influential, quietly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each Government starts and ends with each chapter and budget part, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of policy, but it hides the revulsion of power between the Government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore special attention is paid to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the Democrats suffered from three defects that could not be solved so easily for this year 2008:
The first is the high participation of mandatory laws, called the costs of the mandate holders who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSCHM.
The second is the economic deficit as a consequence of the first failure.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and Community budgetary deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other investment sources, other than taxes, rates and bank credits, often issued obligations disproportionately owed to their associations.
In recent years these debts have been paid through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks received from the state and privatization.
Currently they do not have this resource.
If we tell only official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, what is happening to the ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his Government to order the State's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to owe itself.
The rest of the countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more rationally than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
Thus, there is no need for massive social programmes that have unfortunately been unsustainable in recent years with giant measures.
And although they were able to eliminate part of this year's incomprehensible population expenditure before the elections, if it does not shortly change the age of retirement and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country, and the government who manages it will be just a bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that government policies will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of pension taxes and social benefits.
The budget of this year cannot therefore be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal costs of the mandate holders.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous government had not spent the last ten years as much.
We do not want government politicians to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak government coalition, which takes into account that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and tariffs, the quietness for the preparation of other legal reforms.
This will only make it possible to achieve a balanced budget of the State.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than $1 billion through bids.
In these bids banks provide the types of interest for which they are capable of making money.
For example, American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $90 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
Following the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued increase in the free capital gap that banks could afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the company's consultant Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks has probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on embedded credit, especially in the United States.
Economists still look forward to billions of losses.
"Central banks should really be afraid of what they still expect when they decided to take this step," says ABN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that they have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay their customers more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and lead the US economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another drop of interest types," said the Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to the start of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change affects especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he commented that the discussions of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a foreign mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debate is only structured, are artificial fires of words, replaced by solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue was of great importance to him and that it was of interest to him.
He also expressed his joy in discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I've often only met with the care of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed of their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he, according to his opinion, has sufficient assumptions as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized entertainment, has experiences with statistics and is also economicist.
At the main stage of the conclusion, he expressed his view that climate change is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor are they likely to represent disasters and that efforts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
It has repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental soldiers who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayes Institute.
600,000 people have not been able to change their meat to drive
Six hundred thousand drivers were given their date and therefore they were unable to change their old meat to drive whose validity ended at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for change so that officials can spend time with them until the end of the year when they issue the new meat.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that, after a new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the streets without a valid meat.
According to traffic, the meat has not changed mainly to those who don't even want to drive.
As the people announce a rapid decline in the change of meat, the metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The Unit calculates about 2,000 clients per day.
There's a half an hour waiting in the hills.
In Prague about 150,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of the new meat.
The issue of a new meat takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are obliged to change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but who will leave the streets without a valid meat shall be at risk of a penalty from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infringement with an amnesty.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the previous information, a penalty could be received by that person who does not go anywhere.
They could possibly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on the offices to make a moderate admission of thousands of crowns, as a maximum.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousands of crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the meat to drive is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity meat that each person should have.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the meat to drive.
Simply taking it or sending it to municipal offices by e-mail.
By the end of the year, the meats issued during 1964 and 1993 shall cease to be valid.
However, drivers must gradually change other types of meat to drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The Court reduces the penalty for Berdych's complex detectives
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konerírík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between three and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive sanction to reduce penalties, first to one year, and second to two years.
The department's detectives were accused of organized crime, in principle, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision cannot be appealed, only by the revocation of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he first awaits the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, it has been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s allegations were rejected by the investigation for alleged reasons.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers in accordance with Berdych provided information from police sources to the criminals, covered the thefts, and helped the members of the criminal group to avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 per cent of their theft to Opava and Konerík.
The charge refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft was concerned, its victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the domestic register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser manager and a methrallator.
The criminal group, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already confessed to Berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still reporting other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulej, who have now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change children: 12 million
By changing some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation more than the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with the Veleba proposal.
"So much demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after the meeting today.
"In order for us to make an idea of this counterproposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a redemption value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal stressed.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonn family wanted every month that they had not created their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that it was developed in the hospital of Motol's capacity in Prague.
The parents of girls according to psychologists and psychiatry suffered psychological and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they fought with crimes against girls ' change.
Women bring it worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed it.
Verónica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the Motherhood House of Třebić last year, the ninth of December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and the Chermáký and Príbyslavic, and Verónica and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablonn.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation costs for the error committed at the hospital in Třebić which the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are provided by law as liability for damages.
In the event of errors, they should be removed from the reserve fund and they may request assistance from the administrator.
The court has so far recognized them as a proportionately low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables that account for hundreds of thousands of dollars and outstandingly for a million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the sign of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the Ostrava Provincial Court, it was the first to use the Valaquia Kingdom brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor worked.
Polívka didn't present today at the oral view.
According to your lawyer the case is probably not over and your client will proceed.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are some paradis of Bolek Polivka's popularity," said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, in front of the words Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and comic is seen everywhere.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been behind us for ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
To him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years I have realized that the project has been successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as Parisians of our work," he added.
A profit business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then he was not trying to direct him to the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was able to edit the passport from the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comical source, a business and lucrative business activity was created by Harabiš after the Royal Society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use her name and signed her passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors from her farm and visitors to her shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge also found that Harabiš used only a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Valaquia Kingdom," said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project he is Harabiš and his team who have fully dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration, among the uncomplicated parties today, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then there have been conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination has come with the defeat of King Boleslav I, the one chosen forever.
The main role in the kingdom, by means of Harabiš, was derived from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clearly could lead to the fight, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
You didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We don't have any money.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The King would have to be chosen on a particular date.
Even Mr. Polívka could present himself" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: damaged
In fact, I've never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Their walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, manoeuvre and also the product could be characterized as under the medium.
But now there is its successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, it's just that I'm better thinking about it.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's carriage means in this sense, I'm not going to suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying by the world
Step around the inside quickly so that it doesn't repeat too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is centrally poor tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we missed short seats and support.
In addition to model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the road measures have grown.
In Combi, the mentioned lack of space on the head disappears.
Painterly Painter
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This I must value as very accessible (Thanks to the abattible rear door) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber corridors that offer an ideal solution.
They are not disturbed, and they can be extended to the point of being subjected to heavy objects.
But we'll stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime, it has a capacity of 428 litres that compared to competition is better than average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, we realize that the Peugeot remains on the zaga with its 52 litres perceptible.
From vacations to abroad or when the child’s coach is placed, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I'd have to quote the floor that's pretty flat after cutting the back of the second line.
120 Horses in Four Marks
Our vehicle test was equipped with a four-wave injection fuel on a 1.6 l capacity and 88 kW force.
And to say the truth is this is how a 1600 would seem to minimize the family's five doors.
It's quiet, it consumes little and, above all, has momentum.
If I compare it with the time of the shock then it seemed as if the escape tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that it could be impressed with it.
Prices answer
The car price is not for all bags.
However, we must take into account that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The car's basic price with 1400 injection fire for 329,900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag on our heads, air conditioning automatic, automatic cleaning equipment, automatic rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but account for the team's supplements in Fabia and it'll come to a pretty similar number.
Now you're only left to decide which of the two marks.
Slovenian students are not included in English schools
In English schools there are children from Eastern European countries and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans at present is only a series of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to develop.
Discussions, exorcism and bickering among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam's police arrested an Slovak woman who was holding her pants to a ten-year-old student with a green beard.
In his defense he said the girl was insulting her son with racist tone.
The police had to act also after an attack by two minor girls against an Slovak immigrant.
The girls beat him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the stop of the bus and started to dig us up.
When I told him that he would leave it to us, he would throw us manzanes and pearls, and then put down his pants and showed us his back" described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even referred to the conflict with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
About 30,000 Slovenian students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be achieved, whenever you choose correctly.
The sandy and expensive beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palms and everything included with bedrooms offering pizzas on the beach, iced or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roll.
On the Caribbean island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island is there still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antillas.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the champion of America's conquest.
Colon called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
The Habana became a storage and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 20th year.
He ordered him to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that had been criminal in the U.S. (and therefore prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in La Habana, where large apartments ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a factory in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Ages, the stars of the world of the show and politics of all America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abanese you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the car Hotel National they mix the cocktails according to their wishes.
And these cars have been in service since the 1950s, and they're still functioning by La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat who have arrived some time ago have been oxidized between these wetlands and wind salads.
Even though La Habana, in particular the old neighborhood, is going down considerably, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments around it.
Other places are metaphorphoses in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last five years they have grown new hotels not only in La Habana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity which is in the unique world and which is highly valued by the loved ones of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from large plantations to sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machinery.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and their brotherly models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And that's why we don't need to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned factory there's a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they shouldn't stop visiting him.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque reef in Cuba to the west of the island.
Extensive vegetation growing in rocky soils.
Mogots, rock pillars, and high-scattered rocks in the fall of the valley, and in its roots land fertilization is accelerated by the formation of rocks that are hidden in dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is likely to grow the tobacco of the highest quality in Cuba.
Visiting any of the pure banana factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone looks interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, the Great Zeman.
Trinidad
Old city I reject that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth turned into beauty with buildings in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, particularly influenced by later French colonies, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinity, between the sea and the close of Escambray, is such a separate place that in the last 50's there was no road to join the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because everyone was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which is excited by its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that come there from Guantánamo must pass by high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that knows only man's action.
This eastern location of Cuba has been registered as the property of humanity by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Colón cross (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was found and now there is a hotel with its own name, the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rron, pure, Sierra Mastre, the Bahía de las Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropical, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Cobre, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of which could fill many pages.
However, as it is said, it's better to see it sometimes.
Alliances are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are needed is what is affecting the launch of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Ecocia).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to take greater action, Great Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan Government and the Department of Development Assistance.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population that only they can start economic and security development," the defence minister, Des Browne, told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to US military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year by 27 per cent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan from which the fourth part is located in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit as the organization and equipment of units.
They ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar way today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I'm not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and teams we would need, and that's a little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the end of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the countries involved in the past few months, the politicism of whether all allies are doing the utmost in Afghanistan.
For instance, Germany was criticized for passively.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are located in a minimum area of violence and the fighting requirements there are not as high as in our, south and east parts of the country," Gates said.
The Sensacionalist Sun newspaper, this week called the German soldiers empty.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing at the table.
The German picture responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each check the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842,700 million crowns in September.
This year the government planned to pay $159,200 million.
However, in early December the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million kroner due to the improvement in the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew to 842,700 million kroner in late September.
In nine months of this year, he increased to 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June it has dropped 13.400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the October principled state.
For each check, the debt is 44,000 crowns.
Last year the State owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns by 2009.
The next year the debt should move between 900,000 million and the billion crowns" said to the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Just when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation in the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed in 2010.
But such a change I don't see." He added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the State creates debt in the central government and, above all, arises from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The State's debt is paid by means of assets, State bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state grew from 38.500 million to 719,400 million kroner this year.
The external debt for now has increased from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiated state debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million kronas z since June reduced to 13,700 million kroner.
The average government debt gain increased by 6.5 years.
"The total international debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent of what is enormous given as the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is an increase of 20 per cent.
It's bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it's going to negotiate until there's a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
The State debt-management strategy for 2007 drew attention to the Government's plan to provide $159,200 million this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million kroner due to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount is, above all, due to the state budget deficit which will be 76 million kroner this year instead of 91,300 million kroner.
The remainder consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.300 million kroner, a reserve of 10 billion kroner for pension payments, 43 billion kroner to finance state obligations and 1,800 million kroner payments from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today before a court to Jartúm to give a name to a chicken bear
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for an insult to Islam has been sentenced to Thursday afternoon by a court of Jartúm for 15 days in prison and for expulsion, stated his lawyer.
Britain was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a bear bear bear when all representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable for a lactic acid punishment.
This 54-year-old British school teacher in accordance with the Unity High School of Jartúm in Sudan has been detained on Sunday in his home and accused of being a victim of Islam and seduction under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints by students' parents before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story is actually repeated in September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class fur bear.
" Eight names come out of the children ' s mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, " says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children of each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the dog photo with the following legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear he himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just feel that he has asked the children to vote for a name " is just an " innocent mistake " according to him.
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never talks about religion in class " .
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that concern the use of this name?
For example, can we give him a game?
This is of course an interpretation issue.
Wednesdays have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " in the game " , American counterpart Frank Wisner urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, pointing out that " there are obvious tensions " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December.
Baden's discussions near Vienna constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the tripartite was charged with a new United Nations mediation last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the United Nations in Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union as the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally unless the Security Council decides in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increasing autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Revolution and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his weights.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
"Effect dominated "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning most of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province ' s independence.
Belgrade says in particular to fear a " dominated effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that every decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a right of veto.
" Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia " had announced Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must be completed as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of Albanian independence would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself met on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and the Palestinians had finally reached agreement on a common declaration.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive rule of the 60-year old litigation point among their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians had to disarm " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel had to end their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both of their obligations with regard to the peace corridor they had accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pillars of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the state of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the President of the United States, Abbas stressed that negotiations would be " global and in-depth" and referred to in all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
On his return to the court, Olmert promised that the negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to end them during 2008.
Bush established the term of entry into force at the end of 2008 of its " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this sense in Bush's part before deciding to participate in the conference.
An Arab, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, enthralled by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of comparison in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Sauud in his periodic Arab interview with healthy capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and noises are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car travelled on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Street of Luisa-Miguel, to Villaries-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but in patrol, and circled 40-50 km/h, without turning around " explains a police source.
A green motorcycling of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorised to travel on public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, traveled " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after an inconsistencies on the right," the police said.
The control of alcohol on vehicle operators was negative.
The state of the car (the ground front part, farmed parabolas, started parachutes) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère of Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " involuntary murder and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor needs that IGPN's investigation at this stage devolved police responsibility.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood by the afternoon afternoon, confirmed " the police version, knowing that this minimotocycle had reached its left relatively quickly " .
Yesterday, a sort of injury, no doubt caused by the melting of the legs on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been trapped in time for the police car to get cold.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical contamination.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsy yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a noise quickly circled by Villaries-le-Bel, which says the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not providing such support to both young people.
The IPPN, being prudent, would also set aside " all serious deficiencies " concerning this point.
"It is the aspect of the most difficult research, which requires more research, which must be very cautious," a police source said.
Freedom found an eye witness from these few instances that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly gives you the scene.
"Let us then go down, with my premier who is sick at the hospital, to try to reanimate them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw a totally disappointed police officer, who was asleep.
Two others were trying to get back to one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension surrounding the scene quickly, and it seems to be that the people who were present in the unexpected situation of young people had been taken by the police in a car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the relief came " close to twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in van.
" I will not let it be assumed that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombs came next.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor lamented.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days before General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken under the emergency state have been injured by the lacrimogenous grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The last ones replayed with stones shots, shooting the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police were loading and shooting lawyers.
Many would have been interviewed.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court ' s lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting from a wave of some 500 arrests at the end of the week of opposition, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that provided access to the Supreme Court were blocked by the moon in the morning to prevent grouping.
Other events would have taken place in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (northewest).
The movement of lawyers collected the support of the religious parties regrouped on Monday in the strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the state of emergency and the disappearances to those who had made an oath before Musharraf " .
"The Muharraf promise no more."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the measure of exemption declared on Saturday afternoon.
The next few days had to be addressed on the legitimacy of the re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"All we have to do is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court ' , the judge said in The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army head and to return a " no more " civilian president after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday to the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected to leave its military uniform here from 15 November to the end of its first presidential mandate.
The Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Government of Pakistan has deploreed the country ' s persistent riots that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Forces.
More than one third of pregnant women remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) and unplanned or premature births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) and unplanned or premature births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure index of 5 to 6 %, estimates Ined.
The liberalisation of contraception, however, allowed a better " fertility domain ", according to the institute that notes that the use of the pill between women from 20 to 44 years ago was 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight generations of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less than a month for a couple of each five and if possible for the spring, judged as the most pleasant time to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
More than seven hours of space work will have been required for Scott Parazynski and his international Space Station crew partners to perform the spectacular repair of a detached and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, its removal from residential modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, "chapputed" instruments by the astronauts to perform repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery launch module, a cylindrical grey piece that was soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing anchor for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a 76-metre diameter.
And it's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, has been damaged a little bit more or less than a meter by a cable that has landed.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were beginning to perform a control exit of the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go caraculate at the end of the 30 metres length of the teledirected arm of the launch attached to the station to perform repair.
It's one of the best "space walker" of Nassa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "born".
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut down the impossible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker that had stayed near the air's exclusive and, inside, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a minivan of hockey surrounded with insulators to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapped" by the astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and to return to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a half a day's rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launch for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS Title Sanitated in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Bolza, after the A400M aeronautics and defence group has announced that it is supposed to cost between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion to meet the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros in the Paris Box.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays generated by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, rose " between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European builder EADS.
As a result of these tasks, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding no more accuracy.
The group also indicates that the assessment of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
The group initially provided for the first A400M delivery to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the status quo
No wonder Sunday, on the way out of the Urnas: the Russians are going to choose Massively for President Putine's party, Russia's United Kingdom.
Confirming its ambition for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
For three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin directs voters today a TV message on public chains, already registered but its content is kept secret.
This is done as the leader of the list for Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory appears to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be transparent by receiving foreign embassies, happy to deliver a new charge against the accused West of inference - his pre-leasing issue during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He's reporting a press-manded campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been "so much dirty elections up to the time of Elsin."
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
Following these surprise legislative elections, two more open questions are being raised:
Who will take the lead in Putin?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first re-election of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates are up to 23 December to be met.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then there's no successor coming up.
What role will Putine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the majority of parliamentarians and the very powerful Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the legislative elections like the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet human being, they do not feel entitled to his fate," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the state university of St. Petersburg, is moving further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the popular spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Potine restored the model of a patriarchal state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new patriarchalism has not been followed by terrorism but by a certain economic disaster " is estimated by María Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily give up their personal responsibility " of those who had recently tested after the establishment of the USSR.
"What do you think?"
The phenomenon affects all social levels, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 Governors (of each 85 head of Russian regions) direct the local lists of the United Kingdom.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In view of the fact that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What do you want to reflect?
"Those who are in power aren't too bad, why change them?"
A Hard Memory
After more than 60 years of confidential nature, Bad Arolsen's Nazi files, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are available for free access.
The 47 million file documents stored over 27 km of stay in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were not until here only available for a "humane" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of an ancient victim or of his or her predecessors.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , Reto Meistern, director of these archives administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Several States, such as Germany, have so far been opposed to opening up these nomination documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as supposed homosexuality or mental handips of certain victims of sports.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countries deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide them with proof of their internship, with a view to opening the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin.
The European Union and India want to reach a free change agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has reached around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free change agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade agreement will greatly benefit both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million Europeans in prosperity " , Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually by " EUR 47 billion " and by " EUR 10 billion services " had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential".The European Union and India meet Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi at the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned about facilitating the current return of concerns on credit terms, and announced an offer of $10 billion to the basic index of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" To alleviate the concerns under which the financial market conditions will be particularly open at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its provision of reserves for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , stated in a communiqué.
The bank needs 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) to be placed on the market on 6 December at 1215 GMT, on the basis index and until 10 January.
It is the first time it seems that the BoE Bank puts liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in one week.
The BoE adds in its communication that " it is prepared to take other measures to keep the indicators " of interbank loans online with its basic index.
The interbank index per day was 5,829 % Wednesdays.
The index after three months was established at 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined to an important criminality index that had prevented banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the euro-related free trade, many preferred to subscribe to the amounts marketed by the European Central Bank, to the most profitable indicators and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties refuse to review the PS Party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP Group and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss articles of the socialist proposal on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a breakdown of the text.
In a socialist "nice" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text referred to a decade of measures taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50 % of the surplus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) fleet, a check-in or restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between most and some hours of the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The Head of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectification funding bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Light Festival
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, neither more nor less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 entrusted to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the festival Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer camp destination.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Festival Latitude in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organization tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of a " most inspiring event " to which she has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says her company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are in low-category policies due to current administration, pursued by Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we were prepared to create a great festival on an exceptional site that finally took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grand Park in Chicago, after being demarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross incomes of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These festivals have a place in urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camp festival, while our people are doing better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to fusion, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of countryside festival in the European and American way."
Vineland is more or less halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vienna community, including the mayor, actively supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says " that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", for example, the 80,000 people of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but music will be varied there, with the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the award Top Independent Promoter from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood films to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator resists it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of the delegation.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, charges " runway productions " .
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
"You must be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Road to the Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is despite the promotion of the film here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Czech films, give them value and ensure that the performers have interviews.
The Year of the Ties had a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, just a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the map of Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long meters and four short meters to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Will there be rally at the end of the year in box? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
In less than five weeks to avoid the closure of the exercise, investors are already waving their hands waiting for the traditional rally to arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in box often has a positive attitude.
However, there is no need to make predictions based solely on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainty lies in markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not parties to the fact that in recent weeks the box covers a career, these experts point out that "the bourgeois market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the absence of guarantees, particularly fixed income, affected by the return to quality values in both long and short terms".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a better side behaviour, not an exception of volatility "over all because it is not known the impact of the likely decline in the types of Faith, given the high level of cruelty and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there's gonna be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
Ibex has lost about 4% since the maximum marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year next to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of maps and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year on these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be different this year because he believes that the rally will move forward on the second week of December, after the point of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect market trends.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are near technical levels and "so we could see a rebate of the index that could be seen pushed by the US news on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts them to be positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be charged to take Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches you with great values."
The expert would include in the paper the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
In the meantime, Federico Olucha, of Inverses Bank, ensures that the risers will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders can also benefit from this rally if they give.
"ACS takes several months to recover positions and we hope that other builders such as Railway and FCC will follow their own path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be significant in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the shipping season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologicals will also do so very well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions in December has been a month low.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, the exercise in which the Bursatile markets emerged from the crisis caused by the painting of the technology bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered a 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% response.
You will have to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment Ibex is up to 8.36% since January) and whether it is able to count with its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours a month on Saturday
People have decided to renovate most of their offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These subsidiaries, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to give the jump to the open-ended opening of its agencies up to 20.30 p.m. and open the Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its subsidiaries, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
In the meantime, it is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75 per cent of their offices on Saturdays instead of open one afternoon, even though not to the public.
The results of the People's Experience will be decisive for other entities to point out whether or not this initiative will be based on business schedules.
This is precisely the objective pursued by Popular with the project.
Catch private customers moving through these areas to carry out their purchases, to the Pymes, autonomouss and trades of the roads selected to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
For this purpose, the entity will modernise the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from different roads.
In this way, the expansion of the watches is accompanied by a different concept of the branch space and a new design, more modern, with more bright colors.
The business bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not entail a major investment, although a higher recruitment of staff, since it takes about six local employees to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have space so the Pymes can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branch offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with certainty, according to Rivero.
The population currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And the other 60 who operate under the WorldCredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and festivals.
In these locations of PopularMax the BBVA model will not be repeated, where several of its offices have a large non-financial product bank for their sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telephonica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco for the first time the value in Bolsa of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase, I expressed my satisfaction yesterday with Paolo Vasile, a member of the Telecinco delegation, at the end of the market, when I realized that the lead chain doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect pushed her joy: 'It's what I'm sorry, it's not because we've grown more than because we've dropped less,' she said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain results in its loss as we last year in 15.66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of its capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its Antena River 3, which last year dropped 1,52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costing half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other codified communications companies rose to 3.571 million in Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Finco Day Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to what we are talking about from two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market at what cost and how we benefit from it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it was planned to become the first television chain this year in excess of 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, according to Josephpe Tringali, the member of Telecinco and Public Spain, the branch managing the group's advertising.
To make this data available, the television chain would record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising invoice for the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net invoice of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high payout that has so far maintained: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio may vary after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market presents samples at these moments of discouragement.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It should be explained that the projected increase in income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same signature has reduced the expected gain of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approved the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of Amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to the public a regulation which will develop the new law, with the aim of both of which will enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and make the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to ensure that the entities operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, provides for the modernization of financial markets, while enhancing investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Value Market Commission (CMMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and individuals and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which are linked to securities companies, value agencies and card management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for carrying out operations on financial instruments is widened so that regulated secondary markets are accompanied by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires them to carry out a record of all operations they perform in order to facilitate monitoring by the CMMV.
In its course by the Congress Committee on the Economy, several amendments were incorporated, including the fact that the debt held is considered to be a "complement" financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by the debt of high-risk mortgages in the United States (substantiation).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to limit legally the functions that graduates in Economics and Enterprises can develop for 30 years after the actual decree that limits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
On its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator's, which will work in the past, will not require the authorization of the CMMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five decimal places in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an indication of how prices in Spain evolved during November.
It responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality equivalent data to products in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that employed for the Harmonised Consumer Prices Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it should not necessarily match the final data, which will be disclosed on the next 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the rise in a 4.1 per cent of IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has revealed that the price index will continue at "re relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out at the Congress's passports that "although the number is not good" the difference in inflation between Spain and the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high rise.
"We looked forward to a figure of around 4%," the Minister for Economic Affairs acknowledged with regard to today's earlier date.
Virginia plans to land with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to $12,000 million (EUR 16,800 million) since it fell into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, I had a record record of over $25,000, a figure that had fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the security of the hundreds of millions of such money offered by the Government and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which would renegotiate the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that is deposited in the next three years in order to achieve those remaining $18,000 million until the goal of 30,000 million is achieved.
The Group of Magnate Richard Branson, known for its so-called advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) per year in advertising and marketing technology to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virginia Consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from the bank.
Holding the mayor of Totana for alleged acts of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has been detained this morning at the current mayorial mayor of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with this week's urban corruption.
In addition, one of the constable secretaries and chief of police of the municipality has also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular MP, and until then the mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the Cadena SER, could be the 'headpiece' of this tract.
The agents are still registering municipal units and urbanism councils and are no longer detained in the coming hours.
In addition, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the state of urban corruption raised at the beginning of this week, has been imputed.
As he informed the Cadena SER yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' Member, Juan Morales, therefore, was arrested from Morales' home with important documentation related to the trauma.
Furthermore, the objective of research, according to research sources, is the alleged cost of morale commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalculate 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Welcomes Toledo's candidate for the PSOE and Presidents Congress if they win
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in press round by PSOE's Secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to count with the best" in political life and "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "it seems" that political failure will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if socialists win in the next elections.
It would be good to replace Mr. Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who published his decision on 15 November not to present himself to the next general elections and to leave his career in active policy to fight climate change at the university.
The former Prime Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not given up on his efforts to return to political vanguard since two years ago.
It has also pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the Vice-President of the Economics if the PSOE wins the elections, its party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If you reach your job, Bono expects to turn the House into "the house of respect and not the insult or cry". And make "it seems more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where it is impossible to speak peacefully and socially is Congress, the President of the Government on a certain occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
Also, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and he has not wanted to see himself again taking his position so as not to fall into what, as he has noted, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution both to the sceptics of their predictions and to those who prioritise other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And another leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's EU leadership in the implementation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors have been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity what measures he will take to bridge climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' customs will be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will be.
Who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Exactly because it's about self-sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are indisputable.
Costs, disadvantages and threats to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the hundreds of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously dangerous to Zapatero that he has been afraid to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new tasks.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful to the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but admires mythical and ternural inspiration.
Whenever it is limited to being only a virtual contracting party and does not expect us to move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the bath.
The mayor and chief of Totana's local police were detained for alleged acts of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of Totana's murky locality, "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the Society's secretary and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have now reported sources of research.
The case was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consitorial, whose units are now with numerous agents, who have also joined the City Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three detentions are held in six months ago in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalculation of more than 2 million hectares of Russian land in urbanization so that the Gallagher company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not detained but are impounded in the summary, which is instructed by Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six prisoners have passed the court order today.
According to the sources, the former Managing Director of Totana and the autonomous parliamentarian of PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owned by a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has become imputed, just as the current bride of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur, Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevena), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Sole de Imonauur, an agency integrated into the mentioned group, and through which the bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the detentions, conducted eleven records, mostly in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, in particular the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex of Totana's Murcian municipality, which would support the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
In Totana, the company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land that had been recalibrated and its project would suggest double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the strong parkings of Corunia, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica's square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconit, focusing on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things going on
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If it seems to them, we will leave the Book of the Month to rest, to see if yet another ‘premiology’ and other competencies occur.
I'm already running something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent makes this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper of Finland (for example, in the head of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that the criticism of the book of Blackburn appeared, curiously:
"The content of the philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The killer of the dead, a student of the bachillerate, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Council responsible for the assignment of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutions."

A colleague provides information on the introduction of the Criminal Code of Offenders on Internet Downloads:
A. The removal of a song would be a crime of six months a year.
On the other hand, if you are stealing from the shop discs of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in the store, the theft is already committed, but the penalty continues to be lower than the charging charge (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains below the charge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight to participate in the exchange of compatriots.
Participating in a turquoise reign has a penalty of three months a year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punished than the distribution of pornography to minors (art. 186).
In the end, if my colleague's in the right, someone's going to get his hand, a very long hand.
4. (a) What does the Bible teach us?
My head doctor gives me one of his articles on rare research: 'Money produces brain activity, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what the partners earn.
The study has been carried out through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life &Brain Image Group of the Life & Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers noted that if both agreed to receive the same payment, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was higher.
I don't know if I would require that much science.
The Balkans Taxation
Carla del Ponte is eight years of persecution against the war criminals of the Balkans from the penal court for the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agrident taste, because the main responsible for Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - the former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be released.
Their names are on that list, which takes their title from the document of Swiss author Marcel Schüpbach, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not abroad in Spain) who, at the rate of a police
What do I know for sure?
Automotive insurance, which covers the driver before possible sinisters, is an important cost which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, animal antiquity, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreement instead of being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of syndicate.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the ancientity of the meat, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely to suffer an accident, the greater the amount to be attributed.
That is why both over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a smaller index of synergy due to their discretion.
Also, by exaggerating the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and with it the likelihood of having any type of percussion.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance policyholders take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best adjusts to his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or more insurance types, so that it will, in addition to adapting to the insurance characteristics, offer a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age are faced with several inconveniences when they hire insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the ancientity of the meat.
Although the ideal for being safe is safe at all risks, there are other more economic options.
Precautious drivers can choose for any risk with franchise, so that they get the cover of a insurance to any risk but at a more affordable price.
This type of agreement would suggest that the customer pays part of the amount of the syndicate.
"The share of the amount of the synergy that the customer will contribute will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the lower amount," says Luis Noguera, the most responsible in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is an extended third party insurance so that the customer is guaranteed protection from damage caused to third parties, even if not from those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid sinisters as far as possible, since this will affect the benefit, which could reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A grant is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basis.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can be allowed to increase the benefits," explains Noguera.
Over the past 25 years, drivers have found it easier to hire insurance, since the synistrality index is reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Young people are normally unable to use the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, and even at the time of conduct," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'new age' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risks, always and when his economic situation allows, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by policymakers as the public with less synergy index, so that recharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at any risk with franchise (may be EUR 300), or, where there is a high level of benefit, one at a third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed conduct and have a more purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchise," the judgment of Luis Noguera.
For young people, insurance is recommended for all risks with franchise (i.e. 150 euros), or one to one to three-thirds enlarged when high level of benefit is available.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in front of potential snowboards, but also because it represents an important cost, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that is most appropriate to us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth eight
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective objectives in the close of the 'Champions' league, as it serves Italians to be first and to the Scots to condemn their classification.
The Italians sum up ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their passage with an empathy in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it still needs another to ensure that Shahtar, with six, and receives Benfia, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two groups of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to debate the World Club in Japan, where it starts on 13 in semifinals looking for a deadline for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and empathy in Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, because Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better cross in eight.
As a whole, Gordon Strachan could even use a defeat to classify himself if the Shakhtar does not win, but he cannot be trusted because at the same time as nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) on the other side.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night worse for the Scotches, who trust to be placed in eight for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consequently after they have been exactly defeated in this round the previous campaign with a Kaka gol in the length (1-0) after the 0-0 of the age.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rosoneri' will be the Shakhtar which only deserves the triumph, if Celtic loses both to be placed in eight and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that although it is the last and no option to follow up on the maximum European competition, Benfia could reach the third stage with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Round in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have begun in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first round since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Hallwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the group meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people have taken the steps to attend the concert that included a video in which the story of the group that became angry at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world round match the launch of a new album that collects its main achievements as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage by lighting up some Brazilians that had given them the "Posh Spice" husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who surrounded the GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had been banned a few days ago.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our dress, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what it's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' which emerged from the group in 1998 "by the differences between us" caused the resolution of the fifteenth two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"It's forbidden to set up.
I was nervous but I saw that the world's feeling has changed, the feeling by the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been settled and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, they were expected by an army of girls.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (U.S.), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
Madrid will act on 23 December.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of fuel exports to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous year's debate reduced supplies to EU states.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscow came with the Russian government and the Russian state, a monopolical gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would be worth more in Ukraine, since it has committed itself to pay an extra 50% in 2008 by the gas coming from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but a good part of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control records of past criminal records of employees outside Europe, one observer said.
The general auditor's recommendation Robert Black came after it was verified that a foreign doctor was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS does not have the exact idea of the number of foreign staff with which it counts.
However, his report indicated other controls that were properly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area due to attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was shot at at the doors of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged car bombing in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scotland Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out previous criminal controls, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The General Auditor-General's report recommends, among other things, that the meetings should be conducted under the direction of the Criminal Records Bureau, which will help employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Even if we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that information is available in NHS foreign staff."
BMA President of Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that there are currently 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses.
However, the auditor-general warned that the number could be higher, in part because the associations have problems identifying who are employees who have unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing foreign policy and pre-employment guide in NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in carrying out this work because of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with the health reports, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - which were scheduled to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film prizes
Control, the biographical film on the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including the best film award.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until it was selected for Curtis's role, for Director Anton Corbín and co-protagonist Toby Kebell.
The actress Judi Dench was best named actress by the trailer "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist Daniel Craig won the prize of variety by placing a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were awarded at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise in the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his death in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film -in white and black - which has a sound band of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3 thousand pounds.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbín, already known as the iconic cartoon of the U2 Joshua Tree album, awarded with two prizes-the best director and the best starter director.
The rock music was the centre of another prize in the ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the prize to the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was given by Viggo Mortensen for his role as chauffeur of a leader of the Russian mafia in London, in the film David Cronenberg Promes del East.
Ray Winston, who has the reputation of playing hard, received Richard Jarris' award for his contribution to British film.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the centuries of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Stone".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, so named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
The prizes to independent film, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes cinematists, actors and festival organizers.
The sympathy and events of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Ngyy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrest 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cells that planned an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to contraband missiles.
A campaign against the local monarchy has been launched by sympathizers from Al-Qaeda since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight military cell formed by foreign residents planned an attack on a oil facility in the province of East, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia has created 35,000 effective forces to protect the facilities of Abqaq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "mission launch expert" who had entered the country.
The Minister said that the military had planned the entry by contravention of eight projects in the country.
Other 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis travelling to Iraq to join forces in Al-Qaeda to fight the allies and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered here by the most extreme Saudis.
Al-Qaeda soldiers have in mind many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the real family, which governs the government.
The soldiers - recruited by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda, born in Saudi Arabia, to approach the country's pro-western government - had as targets foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the Minister of the Interior said to state television.
The arrests also include a "mediatic cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunny Muslims who support violence against the so-called unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
The arrest includes other 32 persons accused of providing support and financial support to the military.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data of a European orbital spaceship showed the planet most similar to an Earth mine of what had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a inhabited planet, which scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmosphere erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent to Venus a very different type of development.
Today the planet does not have water, the surface temperature is enough to drain the flame and it's erosion by hurricanes and radio waves.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for one year, provide a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of Oxford University physics Department and one of the leaders of Venus Express mission, says: "It is becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the Earth when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario that Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decommissioned "riched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was decommissioned by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The effectiveness could not be confirmed if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold by $1 million ($440,000, U.S.).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer questions about a snow coin.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidency may agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common and current voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions raised at the end of Wednesday, 28 November, were more ridiculous than the snow monotonous question to Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in front of the elections next year.
It is not exactly how CNN producers, co-sponsored by the debate, chose YouTube videos to show the candidates to the audience.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to one subject, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the debt when they heard ideas that they liked: the stations noted approval points when the candidates spoke with extreme arguments.
The most difficult exchanges of words at night were made between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been the focal point in the critical investigations of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was confused with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of contracting illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (by allowing illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement with the theme.
No one has the word to be nominated, but they both stay in the race maybe because they both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, accompanied by fear of Chinese toxic toys and other external concerns, helps the Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered a torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to shift to the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to respond if Jesus was in favor, the king said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be candidate in the elections.
The road is often open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, in line with the fund-raising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his warm statements of Wednesday's debate.
Both of them have come out of the background, because the two sides of the party have not reached agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convinced party with a winning message about the size of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Workers' Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another way to hunt; but also emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It doesn't seem to have been sold influence, it's not about exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, it's not about extramarital teeth.
But it has been revealed that a rich man of business has disbursed contributions to the English Labour Government party of more than 650,000 foreign pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister called for an election, using stupidly insulting British intelligence, saying that opinions were not influenced by its decision, the hope was that a strong and effective government would provide it.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democratic leader with growing engineering, because Mr. Brown's fear has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a problem bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and lack of justice in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have been made to business groups, together, against the Government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unprecedented administrative chapter.
A third of the retired generals started a protest in the Lores' chamber, protesting against the courts at military expense: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term employment.
Now they are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and previous complication) has already approved.
None of this means that Mr Brown is heading irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a point of inflation after they are unable to rule.
People don't think of them as politicians, but they usually stop their faith when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which does not last much time, this suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; branch ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is focusing on the defence and not focusing on it.
In part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Even though I wanted to renegotiate Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as a Chancellor of the Error.
And even if it is not directly involved in the Blairish contracts - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, no one has been directly arrested.
And the remedy, although painful, is what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his gifts with charity gifts, said that he did not want public recognition for his welfare.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't make him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, chief of fund-raising who was asked about the grants in October.
But Mr Brown has not so far been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the heavy payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
Until now, the prime minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he is reluctant to take decisions on a family matter, an investigation committee on the matter - conducted, in good measure, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent and independent chief for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, because he has not had one for six months and must also be pressured by a genuine reform of the funding of the parties.
This will require a close cooperation work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a rejection of the special financial situation with trade unions - bitter measures for a party like Mr Brown.
But he must face some party facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the investigations; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probity and solid competition.

The crisis of mortgages is affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal lenses don't feel around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, the depreciators have their views on the country's market for credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that losses on credit cards can amount to $99 million if the crisis of mortgages undermines other forms of consumer credit.
The signs of infection are coming.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or which have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken 1.4 million jobs in its financing business for American consumers, partly due to the weakness of card providers.
However, it is very early for the panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point under the historical average.
The deterioration in rates may be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. law on persons ' pensions (2005) resulted in a breakdown in claims on pensions, which, in turn, represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of mortgages) would be re-increasing, or it could happen that the conditions for beneficiaries were deteriorating.
The industry also reports sound payment rates, which show how much consumers pay their debts each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a researcher, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of the crisis infection between mortgages and the credit cards market are certainly there: consumers like to charge credit cards when credit institutions are dropping.
But credit card exposures look more at the liquidity flow than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily act as a change in the creditor's capacity for the lenders.
They can even work to benefit the stations.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing mortgages indicate whether the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt is on the list of priorities.
Card exposures can also respond quickly and flexiblely to difficult conditions as mortgage lenders, changing types of interest or changing credit balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset recovery.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all our loans," says Gary Perlin, head of capital One's finance.
If a sudden subsidisation on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contract push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
You have to keep these dorsal lenses on guard.
Britons declared guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were sentenced for their responsibility in fraud with the former chief of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty of this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocents of seven fraud charges to join Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich the cost of employees.
They were sent to court in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was sentenced as guilty of fraud.
The three ancient Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, its case marks the final flow of an investigation launched after the defeat of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to alert Fastow in 2002 that was the target of a government investigation on the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraud scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidized Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the artifice of a thousands of frauds in Enron, which helped its fall spiral in the neck.
In 2002, the Bank valued the interests of the zero subsidiary, but the three British knew that it would value it.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank's interest in the subsidy at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers accounted for 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced to two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The third British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is carrying out a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is fulfilling a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British banks must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared by bank in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business seem successful.
The collapse has cost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with fraud over the past years because of their role in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is carrying out a sentence of more than 24 years.
Law's sentence for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
You're not down in Moscow
The price of a golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the Russian rich.
"It has up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents."
Mr. Firer was responsible for the Gulfstream office last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumption organ held at a event centre near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stations, waiting to attract new Russians added to all kinds of products, from cable-arted yachts to diamond-cracked car barrels, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright orange porsche in the next stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nice and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by oil growth, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was in trouble.
"We lived the same way in 1890 when some retired Americans came together in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"As in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumer and consumer."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the pastel.
In other parts of Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the list Forbes of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealth includes 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money amounts to $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local thought thought.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of the Russians were below the survival level.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, David Morris's sales and marketing representative, the London Joy.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are absolutely ready and men are very decent."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in late afternoon, two indigenous property agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infinit, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit that I used as a network of veterans dissing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mix brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum shortplums, Movöenpick ice creams, swimming pools, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Dutch real porcelain Delft, before a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted steel.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians from 10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards, have changed their tastes from the logos of limited edition brands, which would not be exposed to a commercial fair.
However, thousands of people — in fact millions of people, millions of tourists or tourists — fill their passports every day.
And some of them buy it.
On the first night of the holiday last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of King Koil's beds, said he sold two collection systems of $70,000 each, silk, cassette and cotton intertwined with gold wires.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that is equipped with high-level cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modified luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car pairs in the form of chain brasalette for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with cross-sectional crystals of Swarovski so that it would look like a wheel wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants leather wheels or a picture of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millenarian" does not mean exclusiveness, given the oil of prices of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably a millionaire, at least on paper if you're not actually doing it," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British style) telephone cables filled with counterfeit bills of $1 million.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped stealing money piles, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on coins of money, or charging a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Circulation "chazza" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Action when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little more healthy" and saw how an ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two lower doors on the West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then you get up to the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That was when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure conducted by an unauthorized plastic surgeon who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of the 212 of Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for several weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that has been attributed to the top ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Gary F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and keeping," said Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-police officer of Newark who worked for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, and left two children 14 and 11 years old, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the Union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 B.C.E.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
He was declared dead in the place.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their research or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a rosal marchito is located on the front of the house, and a palm on the back.
A blue drum labelled as "vainlin ethyl" - used as a substitute for the banilla in food and perfumes - was found at the car door, next to a door leading to the sauna.
Two mountain bikes throw hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he came to Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when she wasn't.
You're pregnant."
It is expected that the federal reserve will cut the rates to raise the Bolsa
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to satisfy the terms of credit with discounts at interest rates, which increased with the restorative comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The bags landed in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, stated that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm markets in the midst of growing credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "a part invested by the improvement in the market in late September and during October".
If the trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make further cuts in the type of interest, to establish the terms of the credit.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street through bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The effects of financial turbulence were highlighted by a Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equal to 4% of its total labour force, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-primary mortgages.
It is expected that only 20 of those posts will enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose to 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose to 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index raised 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the end of 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds of foreign to the value of companies in the first order of Great Britain.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3 per cent.
Previously, there was a rescheduling of credit pressure in the markets after a strong demand for a three-month subsidisation of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at a 4.7% higher rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow up the implementation of the federal reserve and the ECB and to invest extra funds in the values markets in London has accentuated the credit and rates of loans for three months "Libor" between the British banks, which has meant an increase of 6.59 per cent since September, following a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important in front of the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan-with this particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill in tenders to become a national elector, and if not, on a part of a team.
What does not achieve the sixth battle place will be disastrous, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to pull out what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes further from the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck more than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, as it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted at the table: there is only one place for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless it's in the event of falling or jumping to the next chance?
The figures of course have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself "fit and bowles" like the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first class wickets in 33 careers each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the season in Asgiria can be just an opinion issue.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and did well at first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time as he came to become an important player, and despite noting a double hundred against Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today's session at Asgiria stage, will follow their conservation instincts and will favour Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
On behalf of Shah is its brilliant and valuable start-up trial from 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class against only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven younger years old, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in his two tournaments in May against West India in the test in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed that he had taken from his "batting" something from the elite that was in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He took nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, apparently a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone out of (of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say to him excitedly: "Do you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including your rebalancing transition to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, because it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his opportunity, which does not mean that Shah does not oversalt, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive at Baghdad yesterday, expelling refugees who remained ineffective, without visa extension and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on an official train from a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunita doctor.
"I'm back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the militia called by religious soldier Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a temporary stop.
Qassim at Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher and teacher in the Sunita area of Amariah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her face in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His neighbors called him over the phone to tell him that an ally force from the United States helped him get Al-Qaeda out of his village to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's recent arrivals was the leader of a Sunita and Shiite tribe that had been led from his home in Sleikh to the north of Baghdad by an attack of grenades, after he urged the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an ancient Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and support from my friends."
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many said they had been attracted by growing peace in the capital since the U.S. troops had joined groups of " Concerned Citizens" armed and working in cooperation with US military to defend their neighbours.
But many said they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiled, who, the first Chilean Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian deaths.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving faces to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunita.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the end of violence is that the sunnets have been excavated from the narrow and vice versa, reducing tension.
There is the fear that a sudden oil spill of refugees will resurface sectoral tensions and start fighting.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal status is the first in vocational training and is also reflected by the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the sardians lack only one education field.
" Yesterday I explained for fifty times to a non-Sarilandese that we are not French" -- that was the ironic motorcycle itself of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth century.
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Sarre which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Buildundsmonitor" took place in the fifth place.
In this way, traditional higher schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bicycle.
"In Sarre the system of vocational education is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the education sector at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their homework at the Professional School. Thus, Sarre is 7 points per cent above national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of students in Engineering Sciences has declined by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more advertising for engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
The Government has thus introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying as soon as possible the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the PISA 2003 report, the number of post-school development students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, in general, Sarre has not improved much more than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the satisfaction of the sarilandese, although in this field good results could be achieved.
Although the sarilandese are not French, the language of the neighbors is a mandatory assignment in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Let's change time.
Soon there will be another time marriage in Venezuela different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez stopped modifying the time in the South American country after half an hour.
Chavez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
According to the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin, according to the new law, the hour will be at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have an hourly wedding that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States will impose on its day the obligation to the world to change a full hour.
In addition, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breaking of relations with its neighbouring country Colombia due to the action with the taking of hostages.
The right-wing nationalist said that it would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until Conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chavez, who is promoting constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be sufficiently expanded in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with Marxist war in which the release of the hostages was dealt with.
Sunday Chavez said he criticised that the decision taken by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes a feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was spoken by the King of Spain, who felt troubled by the continued interruptions by the populists on the left in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in actual wage threatens German employees despite a strong bond.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimist.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a lower actual salary account than the previous year.
"The blame for this is the weak change in wages, the increase in value added tax and the estrion of food and energy prices," reported Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycles Research.
New unemployment insurance charges can also be applied to employees.
Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Nue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the aim of reducing unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over one year was fair and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office has no need to re-enter into an unpleasant situation, asking for credit and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a policy of the German social-democratic party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with price explosion in the food sector and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: brother-in-law of the Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that has not yet been planted. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and remove them from the pools, which also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be radios in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves along the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind the other, according to Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal " Nature".
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus this is not the case: if one day there had been life there, that would have been one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: air pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface at 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Probably, Venus is a "devil" apple of the Earth, but it's still a bee," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had a very different evolution.
As there have been no special missions since the 1990s, only to investigate this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step in the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of research to be presented in many " Nature" articles, according to researchers, do not only highlight Venus's uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that nearby planets have more common features with the Earth of which we had intended," the ESA reports.
Despite the well-known storm winds in the North Pole, researchers have also discovered in the southern polar region a vocabulary formed by clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon reminds us of wind flows in the high ground air layers of poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has about the mass equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet is also called a white star or an orbital star around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmosphere pressure of 92 bars does not much resemble the Earth, scientists are on the basis that both planets have been formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets water had been accumulated that remained in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones in the Earth, Venus was the largest part of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's myth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, President of the Federation, insisted on the end of the fight between the parties by the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the morning in September.
Horst Koehler, Federal President, was concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that war by the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not be presented as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, he emphasises the Federal President, defending Merkel for the prosecution he received when he made a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of one Chinese policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his disappointment at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor caused major misunderstanding in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbruck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister for Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources in the magazine "Spiegel", endorsed the strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, head of the Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
In affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and another Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battalions with the police on the streets, shots, car fire: Wolfgang Schaeuble warned that there would be disturbances as in the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that all efforts be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
Barriers were made, vandals shot at the police: after serious disturbances by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party), fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to be careful that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said the newspaper "Nue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all of this is already producing its first fruits."
It's still early to set the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
Young people were experiencing serious street disturbances with police in the north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warned of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the gender index among young people under 25 years of age is above the average.
It must be noted that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give the young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than France "there is great social control in families", more than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat thinks, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
During the whole night in the Paris Suburb, Villaries-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with guns overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as stolen garbage and cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been engaged in security.
After seeing a suburban, Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police would take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night about 80 police officers were injured by disturbances in Villaries-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not a crime of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that there is no longer any need to wait for it.
But in which country does Chancellor really live?
After its desperate action, indifference and lack of much content in the general debate of the Low House, it must be said that it does not live in the country which should be governed by it.
With regard to the appeal made to him for having repeatedly committed to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a fine sentence.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what is of concern to critics.
In the House of Commons, it was made very clear to all that such a claim was appropriate.
I could not feel a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented himself in this way: a very high policy that runs into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: the decisions taken in Heiligengamm praised itself very much, but it does not say anything about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of commending itself - two years ago the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been allowed to be so modest.
So he's engaged in expressions so he can get people an impulse.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic design that solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of workers with low wages?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It's impressive how many times it's wrong to talk about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to form a more or less good sentence.
Startled by "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have faced a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates from YouTube and now they have to fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tension between the candidates has already been noted since the beginning.
Mitt Romney appealed to his opponent Rudy Giuliani that it had turned New York into "a shelter for illegal immigrants".
This, for its part, answered with serious accusations: "I mean that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replied to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as the group of Republicans has no clear preference so far, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to mistrust their opponents.
The small 30-second video that was sent to YouTube by Internet users also does not contain much content.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's condemnation to his opponent Ron Paul, the only of the meeting that insisted on immediate withdrawal of Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms by war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, by letting a person become a victim of death.
The public's reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while both the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public was always very proud when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
This way you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," explains Romney, composed and apologized to the people and the public on television for being a defender of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani did not know what to say when she was asked what she thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without uniformity.
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the President of Pakistan was sworn as president.
This was the end of eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony directly at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Mustarraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday he transferred his military commander's mandate to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after it was powered by an insurgent military blow, the former general first ruled the state as civil chief.
With his resignation as Chief of the Armed Forces, Muharraf fulfilled the main conditions of opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was announced by Muharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the public prosecutor-general of the state, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of the exemption and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since the state of exception has been declared in the Supreme Court there have been many party jurists of Muharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country has rejected all resources before the newly contested election of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watristan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The Founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restaurant a copy of "Live 1974" was written in the best time of the band.
They were already very popular in foreign countries back then.
The assistance of these three ladies to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has their helmets, their cables, and above all their buttons.
In the middle is Sitter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed with a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sound, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother you guys.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmony band would do music again.
What needs to be reflected here is this: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band has slipped into people's minds, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public was so surprised.
But why can't the Germans also apply their live legend for the 1970s?
Above all, because the Krautrock mistake has always been more valuable in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry gave the members of the Can 2003 band a "Echo" musical prize for their life, the faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with surprise.
Later Michael Rother spent time in the stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (from the band).
Ignorance in his country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the third was only two years old and in those days it did not have a great effect on the public, however, it was later obtained thanks to others.
Some time ago Moebius and Rodelius had performed music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played at the Berliner Schabuehne station.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rutherford had a job in Kraftwerk and then he worked as a guitarist in the Neu band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that was then too radical.
In 1973, Rutherford followed the Cluster musicians in the Forst prison in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as city refugees.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Rodelius could complain about his position.
That was rather a life of an artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day there appeared a band of Association of the Ottenstein Song Harmony in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Some recall that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to promote harmony and do it again when he tried.
For Rodelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
He ended up on issues of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as "Flammente Herzen".
Cluster has been alive for eight years and has since been more successful than he had had Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
Her music company Greenland was set up as a goal to develop this own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Rodelius, also the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all Krautrock's influences on the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a fine.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in photo projections in white and black, where cable instruments are seen.
There are three veterans in the bottom who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones on the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tons with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
At present electronic music is as much as it should be.
Three people deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment it stirs up, and at a good time of emphasis it sings "Aaaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the gender was not sought in the blues but in the music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or flying from the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who calls here "'68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where did it start and where did it end?
That can break one of the nerves or give you a quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more censorship.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" once again dedicate themselves to war in the Balkans.
But they didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are too much in action and shots or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but right there, in the inner darkness of the country during the war of Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight of the most handsome man in the eight years, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant roles and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the films must be so long and fired?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could have done, if the destination and the film industry had not been so merciful with him. He was a man whose better times of life have passed, which as a monument of his decadence has so far preserved most of his love.
"The Hunting Party" despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, resulting in only a series of unsuccessful films on the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be mentioned in a few words: it's about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo's franchiseers, one of whom acts very fast and that also leads to her falling in love with it.
The content of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that Serbs are no longer presented as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm was Cobra 11" without autopsy, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was never really a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On the other hand, with another director and with another lead author (richard Shepard in two positions), the story about U.S. reporters in the war going to detect a criminal war Serb called "gold", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, history is surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when they first introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let him be a kinic with heart.
No, the guide also provides for a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then be killed.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far away from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's capital hunters, who were captured by the war criminal and left them to the Muslim Bosnians in order to be brought to justice.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematological logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply humane one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladic are still free, and emphasizes that Americans and French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great horrors of his face I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that hard to be good.
The problem is not only about the nature of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fake.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
A rule is almost always worth a rule: when a star is set by a crisis region or by mine fields, then something like "Rangon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other hand at all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Smoking Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts took place in a short time.
They have to spend at least ten years until Hollywood steals a good movie about the holocaust having as an example the movie "The List of Schindler".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the work on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated by unanimity as the master works.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and therefore in our times every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because the script authors don't have the smallest repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"Yes or no" or "The Great dictator" ended up so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that the Nazi regime was so bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to round up a movie.
Maybe it should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant view of an artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his new historical "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That is only due to some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and in Yugoslavia the war will always prevail.
Von Beaust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to continue to fight competitions in the water sports section.
But Beaut remembers that it must be realistic to appreciate the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
Recently, no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective the political momentum could not be maintained, sport at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senator not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
Wednesday the mayor Ole von Beaust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Summer Olympic Games will not be carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for Olympic Games, but it decides on the German Federation for Olympic Sports," says von Beaust at WELT Online.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund (Sportbund) which was expected at the beginning of December, on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we have so far thought to have until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
In spite of everything, this dream did not end forever, said von Beaust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) laments von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are broken at this time," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, HSB's director.
A refusal of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate in a reception on the basis of the general meeting of the German public sports Federation of higher schools (dh).
There von Beaust named Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the Higher Schools Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Group of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfrackion) appealed to the Senate that it would not use this valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small village of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, German social-democratic party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning from Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built-in houses, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed the Leipzig case.
They're not wooden boxes.
Who links the terms of Sweden and wood box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
The wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
A few months after the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes in 1968 by Andy Warhol, the modern Museum of Stockholm conducted internal research and came to a disappointing conclusion: the six "Brill-Boxes" that the former director of the museum Pontis Hultén gave to the Modern Museum, they are false, and almost one hundred others of "Estocolmo" are in circulation in the international art market, as well.
Prehistoric history is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored production.
In 1964 Warhol created its first "Bryllo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had yellow dust cartons "Brill".
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum were exposed hundreds of Brillo card boxes. These did not make them Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brill" card factory.
It was not art works but examples (which were just some objects) presented.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed in Sweden to produce billo boxes of wood, but were not exposed to the Modern Museum.
Witnesses from those times now say that almost 15 boxes, which at the time entered the history of art and subsites as originals of the "Brill-Boxes" of "Estocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were bought in bribes for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén Museum made false statements that were produced and exposed in 1968 in Sweden almost one hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburg.
Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, chief of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, invested six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and painted their open plates and then painted them in oil with the pen.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a wheel without printing the printed plates directly. In addition, it is not about oil painting but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure items".
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious charges" concerning pockets of apple powder.
But since then everything has remained absolutely silent.
The rebel soldiers are running in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had arrived at a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Capilla Antonio Trillanes, who appealed to the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The government's loyal soldiers had lifted the hotel using lacrimogen gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had arrived in the building a few hours ago.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had been sentenced to death for trying to hit the state in 2003 which ended with a failure.
I took advantage of the negotiations, so that I could immediately deposit with about 30 sympathy.
It is clear that the military police who were supposed to monitor him had passed his ranks and followed his motto.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, National Security Council, condemned the conduct of soldiers.
"People are hot," Trillanes said.
"We call people to pass through our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite team Scout Reangers, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the course.
High government critics called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months his Government has been receiving prosecutions for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all attention by the motive that was tried against Arroyo.
The climb failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts of State attacks against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's biggest shareholder.
The United Internet provided more than 20 per cent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 per cent of social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that this step would speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscriber Line).
Wednesdays had already made assumptions about entry into business, after the Bank of Brandenberg increased its participation to the Dusseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains participation rights for a third party.
United Internet already participated with almost 10 percent on the previous day in Drillish telecommunications.
Drillish put 17.4 million new actions at EUR 106.4 million in the capital expansion measure.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"Let's promote our collaboration," explained the United Internet portal.
The two companies founded a company together with MSP to acquire the Freenet competitor.
The United Internet Thursday reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with 10 percent of Freenet's participation and do not use their right, i.e. they do 18.49 percent of Freenet's participation.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially their participation in the anonymous Freenet company.
The United Internet and Freenet negotiations on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "play" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of the United Internet and Drillish had directly 6.01 per cent of Freenet's participation.
Then they had agreed that Drillish was going to reach the other four percent.
The right to buy 18,49 per cent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
