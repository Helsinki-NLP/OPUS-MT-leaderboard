With the main content of the "Starting" series, they are already working on a series of games created by young cinematographic students.
There are students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
Two years ago, the Spanish director of the "Initiation" who was just a failure, Iago Mateo Velasco, is now a member of a group of students who value the births of talented students.
There's a lot of cinemativists around the world, but "Start" is actually a successful, good start-up festival.

The student needs to see what is more important than his first job, not only what the coaches are doing, but also how the designers in other countries are looking for.
The participation in the film's festival is different from the fact that it's important to interact with filmmakers, to exchange ideas.
"Start" is the most important step in establishing an external link.
In dark places, it's going to be filming despite the difficulty of taking action in large cinemas.
And so do cinematists.
The film is a work of art, international cinematographicism, and we're going to add our share to it.
We're not just making movies here, we're learning how to do it, the festival president Sergei Azimov says.
According to the organizers, student films that were cut off during the day of the general election will also be held during the event of independence and will be passed on 7 times.
In spite of the difficulties, it's going to be a life of cinematographicism when it comes to the interest of cinematography.

The Head of State supports the idea to mark the day of the City of Shmkent.
Today, the city head of the city, who is dedicated to the economic and economic crisis in Šimkent, asks President Gabriella Abdirahmov to mark the day of the city.
Historians point out that the capital city of Shmkent was 2200 years old.
Now we're going to prepare special documents for UNESCO.
But no matter how many centuries have passed, the official day of our town has not yet been marked.
You set our special anniversary to 19 days on your own.
In addition, the city's district will offer you a sign of the city's day, says E.

The rules of conflict against "black archeology" are established.
After the "black archaeologists" the alerts are in public condition and are moving away.
In this connection, Mádient and Sports Minister Aristanbek Mūhamedi was informed when he introduced a project on the "Protection and Use of History-based Objects" bill.
It may require a re-examination of the archeological and restoration work that is carried out on objects of historical origin.
It's not certain that most of our warnings or objects that have not yet been searched by "old archaeologists" are being sought and worked out, but after them, the alerts are either in public condition, in public or in complete form.
In addition, historical and cultural events that are being carried out in areas that are likely to be associated with the history and preservation of historical and cultural events will also have a positive impact on the history and preservation of the warnings.
After all, the Minister said that there is a need to strengthen the conditions that require precise order in the exercise of rights and to protect and use historical origin objects.
In view of his point of view, it has been compared to identifying and taking account of historical and historical origin objects at the legislative level, establishing their monitoring procedures, preserving historical origins at the very beginning of the history, and introducing new methods of use.
In addition, it is proposed to carry out archaeological works and to establish rules and conditions against "black archeology", to establish the right of land use in protected areas, to organize the creation of historical and cultural observers, and to define the right to use natural landscapes.
An international experience has been tested and compared in the process of decommissioning a legal project.
For example, Resei's law includes illegal archaeological research, the collection of archaeological objects, the addition of artifacts to the state, and other anti-war archaeological conditions.
I mean, scientific responsibility has been overemphasized.
In Italy there are legal requirements for private collections.
They have been given the opportunity to create and update lists of cultural and cultural objects that are interesting and interesting, as well as historically interesting and self-contained.
Also, even though the property of the so-called objects is protected by the state, despite its limitations, the objects in their mice are protected by the State, says A. Mühamedi.
