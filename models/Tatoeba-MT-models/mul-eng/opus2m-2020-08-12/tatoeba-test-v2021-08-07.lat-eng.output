Thou hast set my heart upon one of thine eyes, and upon the horn of thy neck.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, thy strong habitation, which thou hast built, O LORD, the sanctuary, which thy hands have established.
Keep this commandment to yourself and to your children forever.
Thou shalt live by thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass, when thou shalt be driven out, that thou shalt break forth his yoke from off thy servants.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I am the LORD thy God, a God of zeal, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children in the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and in working mercy upon thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
You don't speak lies against your neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: thou shalt not desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.
You shall not go up by step to my altar, lest your nakedness be revealed.
Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth:
Don't steal.
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD shall not hold him guiltless that taketh the name of the LORD his God in vain.
