Members of the Velso Assembly worried that "it looks like a ghost"
Some Members of the Assembly have objected to the proposal to change their name to the MWP (e.g. Members of the Velso Parliament).
This is related to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Velso Parliament.
Members of the Assembly were concerned that this could lead to political unrest.
One member of the "Work" assembly said that his group was worried that "that this was about "Twp" and "Pwp".
For non-Velso readers: the word "twp" means "wwp", and "pwp" means "kock".
The member of the ‘Plaid’ assembly said that the whole group was ‘unsatisfied’ and offered alternatives.
The Conservatory of Velso claimed that his group was "open" for the change of name, but noted that it was a decrease in the word from the MWP to the 'silence'.
With waves, w is thought to be the same as Jorčyro English is claimed to be produced u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing to change the name of draft legislation, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly, of course, will be the case for the members themselves."
In 2017 the law of the Vells Government granted the Vells Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals for a firm support to the Assembly for the name of the Velso Parliament.
With regard to the name of members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to Members of the Velso Parliament or the WMP, but in public consultations, the MWPs received the highest support.
The members of the assembly clearly offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be painful to President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
Laws on the scope of reforms and other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the plan of the Assembly member's disvalidation and Committee's system.
The members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in country name
On Sunday the voters will vote or change their country 's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia .
A general vote was taken to resolve a ten-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its province, Macedonia.
In the past, former returnees claimed that their northern neighbour's name meant claims to Greece and repeatedly opposed Macedonia's intention to join the EU and NATO.
Contrary to the fact that the name has been changed, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanovas said that the vote would not be taken.
However, rapporteur Zoran Zaev, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that the change in the name is simply a price that is needed to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
During the trials of Harlem St. Martyn and other churches
“ Old people I talked to said that historically every camp could find a bar and a church,” said Adams.
- There's no one today or anyone else."
He said he understood why the bars were gone.
“In these times people are different,” he said.
“There are no neighborhood sites where people are always meeting.”
Speaking of the church, he does not worry that money will not last as long as the leaders expect it, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that the churches can be replaced by many of the cooperative apartments where people who will not soon join the churches will live.
"The majority of people who will buy cooperative beads in these abundances will be white,," he said, "and will therefore regret that moment when the church is completely closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who have moved to these cooperative beads will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built in the white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis — a metropolis community, and the St. Martin church was built ten years later.
The first white-medium congregation was established in the 20th century.
In recent times, the black congregation has taken over the name of the building.
St. Martyn Church took over the Black Congregation with spiritual John Howard Johnson, who led the minority boycott on 125th Street, in Harlem’s main store, where he refused to work or be assigned to higher blacks.
The building was severely burned in 1939, but since Father’s parishioners planned to replace it, they ordered military service.
Spirit David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father of Johnson and the heir of St. Martin’s Church, is a great warrior in the ranks of the poor.
The experts who took the lead in the career called it "the cultural lobby" and "the irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also mentioned that it was the world's first warrior who played the black artist Dionys A. Lindas. He took up the role of the greatest warrior in the Riversaido church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not change him to another musician.
What happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s church was a complex history of architects and monks, some of whom were visited by church councils, others by the Episcopal Church.
Zakristia is a parapet management body made up of world leaders in July expressed concern to the bishop that it was excavating "hard to bear costs" for the Christian, although it did not create architects and organizers who sent it.
Some parasites complain that excavation is becoming a cause of blindness.
A 13-year-old who was injured by a hurricane in California
The officials reported that on Saturday, he had killed a 13 - year - old boy when he received an humour on the opening day of the season in California.
He was shot at about 7 o'clock in the morning in Ensinita, near the falls of Switzerland.
Chadas Hammelis San Diego KSWB-TV plays said he had spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then he left with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammelis initially told me that the boy felt sorry for the bear, but then he realized that the boy cried out: “I’m sorry!
I'm impressed!"
Hammelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire tract was being expanded.
"I cried to everyone for a drink of water, 'The river is flowing out of the water!' Hammelis added.
Bernie was rushed to San Diego’s Children’s Hospital, where he was recognized to be in critical condition.
What kind of boy has been burned in his throat, it's not known.
Captain Larry Gilles reported in the press that a few weeks ago there was a riot in that area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous type of hurricane.
Gilles added that the victim suffered from the trauma of the upper leg.
For 48 hours on investigation and protection, the officers closed the flow from Casablado Ponto to Ensinitas Svami.
Gilles mentioned that there are more than 135 types of rice in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sanisbury's plans to move into the UK beauty market
Saninsbury's is named "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal sales style beauty sections where special consultants will work.
Actively moving into the US 2.8 billion high-value sterile beauty market, which continues to grow, and the patterns of sales of fashion and household goods are emerging, the larger sections of beautiful goods will be tested by 11 sales worldwide and, if they are successful, more sales will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping centres are looking for ways to use the lens, sometimes for televisions, microbanks and household items.
Saninsbury's reported that double its beautiful range of up to 3,000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" range will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those in stores such as "Boots".
The shopping centre also issues its "Boutique" machining range, most of which are vegan products, which is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the company's company France Shop will try the discounts in two Saninsbury's shops, from which the first took place last week in Croatia, South London, and the second one this year will be later in Seli Oake, Birmingham.
Because of buying the Internet and wanting to buy small quantities from local shopping malls every day, it is important to make greater efforts to attract people to visit.
Saninsbury's Director General Mikeâs Coupe’s said that business sales are becoming more and more like universal sales because trading centres are trying to fight sales of cheaper Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and not food products.
Saninsbury's included Argos sales to hundreds of shops and also installed several Habitat sales because two years ago they bought both networks that were positive for the sale of food and their purchase was more profitable.
The previous testing of the shopping centre to update its beauty and medicinal products has failed.
At the beginning of the 1st century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the Union ended the dispute on how to distribute the proceeds from the marketing centres of the drug dealers.
The new strategy emerged after Sanisbury's sales of 125 million tons of sterile steel to the owner of the network of Lloyds Pharmacy in 281 pharmaceutical shops.
It was claimed that Lloyds contributed to this plan by adding an extended range of brand brands for leather care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
The director of the Saninsbury's business said Paul Millsas-Hicks: "We have changed the appearance of beautiful sections and the atmosphere in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and attractive places we are now attracted to a beautiful place, leading to the challenge of old-fashioned shopping."
Peter Jones is "felt" because Holly Willoughby stopped his 11 million-dollar stereotype deal
"Dragons Den" stared Peter Jones "embark" after the television broadcast of Holly Willoughby ended 11 million weight-serling transactions with the brand of his way of life in order to concentrate on the new contract with "Marks and Spencer" and ITV
H. Willoughby does not have time for their home accommodation and accessory brand "Truly".
The pair business was compared to the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" post is led by Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's last moment left a profitable brand of goods in order to concentrate on his new big deal with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV", he grabbed "Dragons Den" at the star Peter Jones.
The sources say that Jonah was “incessant” when, on the second day of the earthquake, a gold television girl admitted to his business in the palace of Marlow (Bakingamshyr) that because of new transactions with up to 1.5 million megagrams of importance, it was not enough for her to assign her house furniture and accessory brands to Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand “Goop”, and it was believed that it had to double H. Willoughby’s 11 million weight-weight sterile assets.
As H. Willoughby, 37 years old, reported that he had left Truly, and Jones left Britain for one of his summer vacations.
The source said, "Truly" has so far been one of the most important Holly priorities.
This must have been her long - term future, which would have troubled her for decades to come.
Their decision to leave was unusual.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday because it was so close.
Marlou has a full store of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the launch of The Morning, which is one of the most financially successful stars of Great Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars for large investments in products, starting with trout and fishing, and ending with clothing and household items, as well as that it will be delayed.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
Her mother, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dana Baldwins, maintained close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016 H. Willoughby and T. Cappu created Truly, and P. Jones joined the fight for 52 years as president.
At the same time, P. Jones has 40% of the shares of the Baldwin TV production company.
H. Willoughby will become the "M&S" trade mark ambassador and replace I'm A Celebrity", led by Anton McPartlin.
The author of Artimas Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
We talked a lot and then "we thought"
He welcomed the criticism received from the media about the comment that some might consider to be "non-presidential" and also because he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trumpas refuse so much?
The group's "new driver" vote said:
"I didn't break anything."
He noted that Kim has been interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which took a great step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, negotiations on a nuclear decommissioning strategy.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat, Ri Yoong Ho, told the world's leaders during the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not receive a "responsible answer" from the United States on the rise of North Korea.
He noted that instead of the United States, sanctions continue to be imposed.
The troops expressed a much more optimistic view in their own language.
“We are very closely following North Korea,” he said.
- We're trying to fight North Korea.
It would be a fish for millions of people.
Now we're supporting these wonderful relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: this was the end of the rocket tests, help to free the prisoners and return home from the American army.
He defended his unusual view of Kim’s relationship.
"That's easy to be the president, but if we had 10,000 people who wanted to get into this adjacent arena we'd better have about 200 people standing here," Trumpas said, pointing to the mine standing right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes devastated the island by killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, non-governmental organisations were informed that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombo population were displaced, this was not declared a national disaster, a condition necessary to provide international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that international aid is not needed, so it is very difficult," said Sumbung.
Although the "Delivering Children" is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the area.
Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the persistent earthquake in Indonesia, the country is still not well equipped for natural disasters.
Although additions from Cunami were built in Achehe, they are not common in other coastal areas.
In spite of the warning, the apparent absence of the tsunami alerts by Pal has almost doubled the lives lost.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The detonated hospital ship, which is treated from groundbreaking victims, is swimming in Palu, but it will reach a new disaster site at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo chose the restoration of the Indonesian infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, which he used to spend money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not leave Joko’s administration in peace, as he was again involved in the elections in the coming years.
There is also no pressure on the continued influence of the consequences in Indonesia, where most Muslim members view a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were also killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because of the use of knives, rifles, and other conventional weapons by Christians and Muslims on the streets of the battlefield.
See: Liverpool player Danielis Sturridge's introduced a further price comparison for Chelsea
Daniels Sturridge’s saved Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea Premier level at the 89th minute of entry into London on the sixth day of Stamford Bridge.
When their command was rejected 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri transferred the bag about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He pushed the ball over his leg and tried to reach the distant shoreline.
High above the punishment area, the balls are thrown into the right-hand top net camp.
Finally, he crossed over the famous Cape Arezabalaga and reached the network.
“I just try to take this situation so I can get a ball, and such players as Shaqas always play as much as possible in advance, so I just try to stay as long as I can for the rest of my time as possible – LiverpoolFC.com said Sturridge.
"I saw a fugitive in Kante, and one thing I did was hit the ball and, without much doubt, just more."
After the star of Belgium, the 25-minute "Chelsea" of Eden Hazard from the first tower started at 1:0.
During that attack, the “green” sides of the valley returned to the hill to Matthew Kovaci and pushed the "Liverpool" sideline.
In the middle of this area, the wall was quickly broken down.
The mob then sent a mob between the rebels to the camp at Hazard’s hands.
Hazardas surrounded the fighters and moved the player Alison Becker's leg to the network to the remote corner.

The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is already 832
As reported earlier on Sunday, the country’s disaster agency reported the number of deaths in Indonesia from landslides and tsunamis to 832.
At the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Press Conference, the representative of the Agency reported that many people had been disturbed by the earthquake that occurred on Friday because of a 7.5 - foot [6 m] earthquake.
The city of more than 380,000 people lived in a large part of the city was destroyed by the earthquake of the complex.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing after the murder of a woman
The murder investigation was initiated after the women's body was found this morning in Berkenhede (Messaida).
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the Street of Greison Muse, John, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested for murder.
The police called on some people who had seen or heard in the territory to tell them.
Detective Brianas O'Haganas said: “Before any stage of the investigation was too early, but I would like to call on all those who were near John's street in Berkenhede and saw or heard anything that they suspected they would contact us.
I would also like to call on everyone, especially drivers who were able to catch up with a video recorder and contact us, because they can have information that is essential to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhede and was found in the building.
This afternoon my friends, who knew my wife, came to the event site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing because the police reported that this is being reported by the most affected family members.
The driver who lived in Greison Muse tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that no one could enter and leave the building.
He didn't want them to know what happened.
Now it was announced to the inhabitants that they would have to wait a few hours until they were allowed to return home.
It was heard how a police officer explained to one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the crime scene, a woman appeared to be drunk.
She kept saying, "It's so bad."
At 14 hours, two police vans stood in front of the front door on the inside, and another van was for him from the side of the field.

Parliament's Cromwell Statutes are followed by the last attempt to "record the history" of the dispute.
Their removal would be a positive justification for the actions of the Taliban to commemorate the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England by fanatical Cromwell Puritans.
However, Cromwell’s friend J. Cricko described the proposal as “a joke” and “a try to re-write history”.
John Goldsmithas, president of Cromwell’s Association, said: “In the current discussions on the transfer of the statues, Oliver Cromvelio’s statue to Westminster’s rooms was inevitably to become upright.
Cromvelis did not speak of civil war icons and did not perform.
It may not be that Cromvelis will be killed for the actions of his father Tom in the past year.
The great picture of Cromwell created by Sero William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the story of a 19th-century perspective and of the ideas that many still deserve to be respected.
J. Goldsmithas "The Sunday Telegraph" said: "Many people, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, Cromvelis was considered the champion of Parliament from external pressure, and this was of course a monarchy.
If this is fully accurately reflected, history is still arguing.
It is clear that the middle of the 17th century conflict formed a later development of our people, and Cromvelis became the unique figure representing one of the parties to this division.
For as the LORD hath fought, so are the achievements of men to be remembered and respected.
A young Jewish man died and found a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in the southern Chinese market, a pig was slaughtered and killed by a farmer.
The following Sunday, Morning Post reported that he found a dead man named Yuana. Because of his damaged artery, he was covered with blood and lay next to his graveyard in the Lupanšu market in Guidjou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, the breeder of pigs in Sininge (Ringhaus Province, China) was ready to give vaccines to pigs.
He reported that on the third day, he and his half brother were planning to travel to the market to sell 15 cows.
The next morning, the family saw death and opened the door to the fast - moving horse.
He said there was a big tumor in the bone, which had a blood clot.
According to the report, the court’s expert confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms [250 kg] of eggs had infected the farmer.
“Guyang Evening News” quote: “My semi-brolled legs were rough and damaged,” said a semi-broker, pointing out his name Wu, .
The protective camera film showed Yuan, who entered the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his cows.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man's dead animals didn't belong to Yuan or his half-breed.
The leader of the market reported "Evening News" that the dog had to be shut down so that other people would not be beaten up and kept until the police collected evidence at the site.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market government are responsible for the compensation of death.
A few, however, have been struck by cases of domestic swine fever.
In 2016 the pig killed a woman and her husband in the farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a cow weighs 295 pounds [295 kg] of eggs pushed Velso farmer to the tractor and pressed until the animal was hatched.
Following the 2012 meeting of Oregnon Farmer, one Manitobo Farmer, CBC News, said that the ears are not usually aggressive, but aggression can lead to blood clots.
‘It’s just toys.
She likes to scream, she's very funny... she won't hurt anybody.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Uruguayan Rozos brings a big case to the south of the United States
It is expected that Uruguayan Rosa is weakened by moving through the waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, the next day, Roza will bring the case to the whole north of Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday from 5 o'clock in the morning, Roza moved 137 km/h as category 1 hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenia Castle (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the other side of the Roman waters begins forming a rising underground pressure area and moving east, along the west coast of the United States. As Rose will join the California Peninsula on the first day of her accession, she will start bringing a great return force to the north, to the southern United States.
On Monday in some areas of Mexico, Roza will cause up to 25 inches [25 cm] of cases.
Then the courage of the returnees, in cooperation with the upcoming advanced low pressure area, will bring a wide range of cases of cases that are particularly disturbing to the south in the next day.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 inches [10 cm] in length, there will be a danger of floods, floods, and possible flooding in the desert.
Because of the great resurgence in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, it will break out from 5 to 8 inches per hour of crystals.
It is expected that 5 to 8 centimetres of matter will occur in the southern regions, in particular in large parts of Arizona.
As a result of the nature of the recovered case, the possibility of sudden floods and rapidly deteriorating conditions has increased.
In the case of retraced eggs, particularly empty thought would lead to thickness in the legs.
A heavy cannon cannon can be turned into toxic rivers, and the blood can cause wind and dust.
As the area of low pressure is approaching, there will be a number of local poor cases in the southern part of California.
It is expected that more than one centimetre of crystals can cause a slight flow of debris and that the roads can become smooth.
This would be the first time in the oil season in the region.
Some of the returns will begin to arrive at Arizona's late Sunday and early Monday, and later on the late Monday and Tuesday.
The new state of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Jutos will continue on Tuesday.
In the past, intense temperature fluctuations can occur throughout the United States, as Arctic is late, but it will be very hot in the recovery zone.
This sometimes results in major changes in temperature in small distances.
The Sunday was an excellent example of high temperature differences in central America.
The temperature of Kansas City (Misrüris) and Homea (Nebrasca) ranges from almost 20 degrees from St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat should be renewed and increased.
It is expected that in the large central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South to the north, the heat will be reduced to a high level of 27 degrees.
The temperature in New York should rise to 27 degrees on the second day, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the U.S. temperature in the morning will be higher in the first half of October than the average multi-year temperature.
Over 20 million people attended Bretto Kavanaugh Court meeting
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday during the six television broadcasts by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence in the decade.
However, the political abbreviation continued after the broadcasters stopped regular programmes on the last five-day change: Senator Arizona has concluded an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation into city charges.
The Ford Senate Court Committee was told that it is absolutely true that Kavanaugh arrested her during the high school evening and tried to rob her of her clothes.
Kavanaugh frankly testified that he was absolutely sure it wasn't.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that, if possible, more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the transmission through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has a number of difficulties with watching television in offices.
To explain more clearly, this is the same size auditor as it would have done during the opening football races or Oskar awards.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, which the leaders firmly supported Kavanaugh's candidate, was the first of all networks when the number of observers reached an average of 5.69 million during the trial session that lasted a whole day.
ABC, expected 3.26 million views, was second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million, CNN - 2.52 million.
A great deal of interest remained after the Court's hearing.
The main feature of the five-day drama was Flake.
Following the announcement by a small Republican office that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras when the protesters called on him, trying to lift him to a meeting of the Court Committee.
CNN filmed it directly in the bottom of the eyes when it was being dropped by people.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told: "You have power when so many women are running."
Flakea said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say something more at the meeting of the Court Committee.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks were interviewed directly when the Court Committee voted for the candidacy of Kavanaugh to Senate.
However, Fleke says that this will only be achieved by knowing that the FTB will investigate the charges to the candidate over the coming week, which led to the investigation by a minority of democratics.
Fleke, who spoke with his friend, Senator Chris Coonsu, was partially convinced.
After consulting with Coonsu and several senators, Flakea decided.
The choice of Fleke was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh after the investigation.
President Trumpas initiated an FTB investigation on suspicions against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister charges criticism of "Brexit"
The Prime Minister Theresa May, in his interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, endorsed her plans to leave critical people of the European Union "by playing politics" with the future of the British and in order to harm national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with her "Brexit" plan, saying that Great Britain and the EU should collect one another's tariffs and that it is "all absurd".
Waydeo Simso's arrest The police took the suspect Ditheon Simpson about the death of LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of being killed by a 20-year-old LSU basketball player by Wayde Sims.
Baton Ružo Police Department reported that for the 20th century, Ditheona Simpson was arrested and imprisoned and sentenced to a second-stage murder.
The officers published a video of Simso and Simpson's arrest, and the police mentioned that Simss had his eyes on the bridge.
The CBS branch WAFB reports that the police took off the scene and found their Simpson DNA.
When Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he had killed Wade.
The lawyer informs that the security of his release is $350,000.
The Eastern Baton Russian paramilitary expert service issued a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a bullet in the head, moving into the neck.
The section shall be allocated to the police of the state of Louisiana, the State police, the State police crime laboratories, the Southern University police and the people of the region who assisted in the investigation that was suspected.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the region's lawmakers for "the exercise of gravity and justice".
Simsa was 20 years old.
A nine - foot - tall boy grew up in Baton Ruže, where his father Wayne also played a scrap of LSU.
Last season the young player played an average score of 5.6 points and gained 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, LSU's coach Willas Wade said that the team is "complicated" and "scoffed".
"This is always thought of," said Wade.
Illustrating an explosion in the city of Mexico
From the fireplace of Popocatepet, the bells that reached the southern capital of Mexico were released.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the fire when the crater’s activity was intensified and the emissions of gas and coal were recorded within 24 hours 183 times.
The center observed a lot of noise and noise.
The pictures in the social media show the plane covered by the front cars in the Mexican area, e.g. Chochimilke.
Geophysics observed that 72 km of the main fire activity increased when the earthquake hit central Mexico on September 7, 2017.
The fireman named Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police formed a separate catalytic
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters were arrested for their independence with the Russian police and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations in order to mention the first years of the vote against Catalonia on separation.
A group of separatists who had been arrested by the Russian police had been covered with eggs and dust, which caused dark dust in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
The police used lashes to stop the massacres that began the next day.
Within a few hours of the group's independence, singing "I'm Not Forgotten, I'm Unforgettable," met with the Union protesters who shouted, "It's living in Spain!"
The local press reported that four quarters of people were treated for minor injuries experienced during protests.
Years after the referendum held by Madrid on 1 October, which is illegal, but which is accompanied by Catalan separatists, the pressure in the region of independence remains high.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but because of a large part of the vote, there was a low number of voters who refused to be excluded.
According to the Catholic authorities who tried to stop the vote in elections throughout the region last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured during violent incidents.
On Friday night, a group of independent groups set up a station to prevent demonstrations that support national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termess, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was not sure about the perspective of Catholicism’s independence.
"In recent years we have lived one of the best points.
I watched my parents joyfully shout for the opportunity to vote, but now we are busy," he said.
Despite the fact that last year's December in regional elections has been extended vitally and seriously achieved, the parties to the independence of Catalonia have found it difficult to maintain their ground during this year when many of their most prominent leaders have withdrawn into voluntary turmoil or are detained and wait for a judgment on the role of organizing referendum and later publishing independence.
According to 42 - year - old mechanic Joan Puigas, who tweeted on his phone, said that the conflict had erupted between the two sides of the conflict.
"The pressure is constantly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Orioli Junqueras, one of the leaders of nine Catalans, ended up in pretrial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament's elections is the best way to highlight the lack of democratic values and the repressions demonstrated by the Spanish Government," he said.
London. Keep the men in the car home

The incident took place on Thursday about 19.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.

The Mengo Squirrel ensures the survival of Livingston 1:0 against the Rangers
"Livingston" player Dolly Mengo's first prize guaranteed victory
At a higher level, Livingston was surprised at the Rangers, under the authority of the Ibrox Club’s leader, Steven Gerard, to lose the second of 18 hostages.
Dolly Mengo's strike proved very important because during the moment, the Gary Holto team compared it to the Hibernian.
The Gerard team will meet with the Leaders Hearts on the following Sunday after the fall of the Premier season.
Before this, the fourth day at the European level, Rangers played games at home with One Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended his uncompared series in the division to six, and chief coach Holtas has not yet gone through a loss scene, as Kenny Miller changed only last month.
Livingston's chance of a holiday at a party with standing guests
Even before the invasion, the Holto team had to be in advance of its retreat from the various problems of Rangers.
Scott Robinson initially pushed and tried to break the doors, and then Alan Lithgow couldn't reach Craig Halkett's head and this man ran over the door.
The family members were not surprised by allowing Rangers to play in front of them because they knew that they could contribute to disasters by creating standard situations.
In fact, it was also in favour of a decision to enter into force.
"Rangers" has lost its freedom of movement and "Livingston" has moved forward; Declanas Gallagheris and Robinson have, in their common efforts, transferred the canal to Menga, and this has resulted in a loss of profits from the middle of the punishment area.
Since then, Rangers has been more controlled than ever, but family defense has not been effective and the work of Lord Liamul Kelly has been almost inactive.
Such a game continued on the second floor, although Kelly had to work at the Atremium of Alfredo Morelos's toy in the door.
Scotto Pittman's ring "Rangers" was pulled off by Allanas McGregoras, and after the standard situation in Livingston, Lithgow sent the bullets to the door.
The transfer of the suitcases was always confined to the Livingston punishment area, but each time it was ghosted, and two requirements were assigned to the punishment – one because of Halkett’s encounter with Glenn Middleton after the change – and the other because of the use of the cotton hand – were not satisfied.
Analysis of Livingston phenomenon
BBC Scotland Reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game "Livingston" and the result.
All of them were perfect and kept waiting for the ever-changing game.
The game styles and staff from return to the highest level have almost changed, but great profits are due to Holt because when he arrived he burned the team.
He's got a lot of people talking to him.
Captain Halket played a great game with a perfectly organized defense, and Menga worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose consciousness.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well under the leadership of Gerard, this time they were very lacking in order to reach their level.
They had a small muscle of decisive strains and only once acted for the protection of family members. There was a certain lack of response to the command of the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne was agreed on several
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in mid-Berlyn.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's opposition visit to Germany when it was intended to restore relations between NATO allies.
Leaders are arguing about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelna to open a new big box.
The city is the largest community of the inhabitants of Turkey beyond the Turkish border.
The police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the security shield, but many of the supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom were deaf, also tried to hear both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to agree with him in his country.
Several protests show that visitors are disappointed: some German Turks take it for granted, others float it and call it a dictator.

Morgana Rosa with her instant baths green for Finikssu, Las Vegas, Solt Leik Sichi (for dry areas it can be useful)
It is not unusual for the depression of the returnees to strike Arizona, but it will soon happen next week when hurricane Rose and her remaining energy will be exposed during the southern darkness and result in a sudden risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already announced to monitor the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, covering the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Jutas, including Finiks, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leik City.
It is expected that the next day the case will be brought to justice by Rosa on the second day.
In Finnish, the National Weather Service noted that “only ten cycles of recovery were spent in recovery or recovery depression not more than 322 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane, not more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National hurricane Centre are forecast to reach 5 to 10 inches [5 to 10 cm] of crystals, while some of the Arizona Mogolon Rome sites will reach 5 inches [5 cm].
Other southwestern areas, including the central Mount Wallinius and the Great Basin, will be almost five to five inches [2.5 to 5 cm] long, and where you can cross up to 10 inches [10 cm].
For people who don't go to hot pools, the Russian case can be supported because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these criteria can be useful, as the southern is currently suffering from drought.
According to U.S. drought monitoring centre data, some 40% of Arizona suffers from very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Uruguayan Rosa travels across the coast of California, which belongs to Mexico.
The next day, Rosa, still in the equivalent category of the hurricane with a maximum of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Euchenia Castle (Mexico) and moves north at 19 km/h.
Audrey meets with fresher waters in the region of the Pacific and is therefore pregnant.
It is therefore expected that it will reach Mexico’s newspaper with the power of the reinvigorating spring on the first day in the south or in the evening.
Critics in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and pose a serious risk to drinking water.
"From the middle of California to the north-west, Sonora is expected to hold from 8 to 15 inches but, if possible, up to 25 inches [25 cm] of crystals," said weather.com.
Then Rosa will reach the north through Mexico as a restorer, and then, on Tuesday morning, she will reach the Arizona Wall as a restorer depression, and on Tuesday evening she will reach the southern Jutos link.
"The main risk expected from Rozos or its remnants is a very high level of debt in the southern part of California, in the western part of Sonoro and in the southern part of the United States," the National Urgan Centre reported.
These cases are believed to result in rapid floods, floods in droughts and droughts in mountainous areas.
Inflammation in Midsamer Norton. Kill four persons suspected of killing
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were held suspected of killing after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
Adults were found injured in the Midsamer Norton area of Excelsior, about 04.00 p.m. by BVL on Saturday.

Theumpas says that Kavanaugh "has been affected by the lack of a party of democracy, it's a failure".
"Balsas for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the relentless and damaging tactics of the Democratic Party," Trumpas said in his speech in Vilinge, West Virginia.
The troops said that Kavanaugh "has experienced the feminities of the Democratic Party, the victory" during its candidacy process.
Kavanaugh's fourth-day witness to the convention strongly and emotionally opposed Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had been sexually abused several decades ago when they were still young.
At the Ford Court's meeting, he also testified on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw that day what Kavanaugh was doing, the original and the original.
“The vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, this is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation in the field of public services,” he said to the supporters of the West Virginia.
The President pointed out directly about the candidacy of Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the activity of the Republican elections in central elections.
“There are five weeks of very important choices in our life.
I did not participate, although I was really involved, ” he said.
- That's why I'm fighting for great candidates."
The troops said that the Democrats are trying to "define and stop".
The senior GOP Deputy CNN said that the first major procedural vote on the appointment of the Senate should take place no later than five days later.
Hundreds of deaths due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia continue to increase
The government authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were drowned because of the massive flooding of floods when the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On the fifth day, hundreds of people gathered at the city’s flood festival, when they took their tents to the coast, which was about six metres high. Many of them died and destroyed everything they had stored on the road.
After the tsunami 7,5 earthquake occurred.
“When the tsunami hit last night, people were still in a flood and didn’t run away immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency at the time of the information report in Jjakarta.
“Cunamis didn’t own it, he drove out cars, trains, homes, he hit everyone on the ground”, said Nugroho and added that before the coast, the cunas opened the sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people jumped into the woods to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu.
A picture of a nearby disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, left and damaged, and the lake was flooded with water.
On Saturday, the city of the sea was further shaken by repeated hardships.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in areas where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that energy was separated by about 200 times over atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II on Friday.
It was reported that the tsunamis could be strengthened by the geographical situation of the city, while it lay long, hard at the end of the siege.
Nagroho described the damage as “great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some of the victims’ bodies were found trapped behind the walls of buildings, later added to the damage of 540 people and 29 people without knowledge.
Nagroho said that the number of victims and damages can be higher than the coast, which is 300 km north of Palu, in a place called Dongala, which is a more land-based epicenter.
Nagroho said that the network "was completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Donegal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers are moving to areas affected by disasters.
It was said that "it could already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could worsen."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised without reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials said that the bane had rejected the warning.
In a popular social media material, you can hear a man sitting on the floor of the building who is calling for a coming tsunami for people standing down the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water breaks down, draining buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the film material.
As a result of land pollution and tsunamis, electricity supply was hampered by open networks around Palu, and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
The authorities reported that the military from Jakarta and other cities had begun to send cargo flights with aid supplies, but the evacuated person still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when the World Vision staff from Dongalo safely traveled to Palu, where workers were trapped in the emergency shelters built at the office building, images were left on their way.
"They told me the sight of many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take difficult action to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that there were many foreign workers who had been denied access to the Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, care and foreign staff can only help when a national disaster zone is announced.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said the representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, press Mr Auli Ariani.
– When the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can call for international aid, but this status has not yet been published."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Pula, close friends and relatives believed that their loved ones would become a miracle that would affect the life - threatening history of natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
The rescuers released a woman who had been raped two days after her mother’s pains.
The Indonesian National Support Team coach Gendo Subandon was awarded two large Asian players who ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of the disabled in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandaja, were his students.
“As I am older in the field of sports, I am carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendona was a little surprised at how he announced the crisis of the Roa Roa Hotel, this news was coming after a community of paramedics sports. He promptly sent out news using the WhatsApp program, Palu to the Russians who participated in the flood festival.
However, there was only one pillar in his knowledge, and not two layers of blue.
"I think this means that the news has not been received," he said.
The Newport on the Levee was awarded $26,750
On Friday morning, according to a report from the Newport Police Department, he paid $26,750 from the Brink's employee, who was in charge of the Newport on the Levee bank.
“The car driver was a close-up banknote in a business complex and was ready to add more money,” wrote Dr. Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, another person "was away from the back of the Brink's employee" and threatened to add the money exchange.

Kanye Westas. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye Westas changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced the change in Twitter section, he wrote: “Assume, formerly officially known as Kanye Westas”.
At 41 years of age, Mr. Westas had been known as Ye and was named after the eight album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the "Saturday Night Live" show, where Westa was expected to present her new "Yandhi" album.
This is where he has to change the artist Arian Grand who has rejected the exhibition on "economic reasons," said the creator.
This is not just a downturn of the current professional name – Mr. Westas said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
“I thought that ‘ye’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’” said Mr. Westas earlier, referring to the name of the album with radio conductor Bigu Boyyuumi.
"So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It started from Kanye, which means one, and the next only Yes, which means our smell, evil, panic, all repertoire.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of many known reperations that have changed his name.
Seana Combsas was known as Puff Daddy, P. Grandy or Grandy, but this year he announced priority in the name of Love and Brotherly Love.
The former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without him or her.
Mexican policy Andrés Manuel Lópeza Obadoras (AMLO) urges us not to use war against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lópeza Obradoras, promised never to use military power against civilians when the country comes to the 50th rounds of repression against students in the year.
Lópeza Obradoras promised Saturday in the Tlatelolco area "Never use military powers to disturb the people of Mexico".
On 2 October 1968, while the movement of the rest of the students in Latin America began, military representatives in the field attacked the right demonstration and killed 300 people.
Lópeza Obradoras made a solemn promise to support young Mexicans each month by subsidizing the students and opening up more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education include youth into criminal groups.
The U.S. should double labour investment financing
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of labour intelligence, the United States should double the amount released for research in this area," says investor and labour intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked as Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were expected after several U.S. government authorities published reports on labour intelligence, even though the United States is not in general an official labour intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China has presented its plan by 2030 for the first time in the field of intellectual innovation.
"The double budget of labour research research would be well started, given that all other countries are more advanced in the United States and are expected to do so in the field of other probational labour intelligence," said Lee.
The double funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of labour intelligence will be U.S., as Lee said at the interview this week at CNBC.
Lee, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director-General of Synovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's most famous industrial intellectual companies Face ++.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon in the ninth century, he worked with a working intelligence system that killed the top American player Othello and later was the head of Microsoft Research and the head of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics challenge of the Agency's advanced research projects, and in order to help find more audiences, he asked when else would be there.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have difficulty in trying to win state grants.
"This is not China's name of academic leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have made it easier for universities to work with professional intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts towards labour intelligence.
"I believe that doctors working in the field of labour intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
On July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its New Renewable Intelligent Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that China's National Science Fund is funding academic institutions people, similar to the National Science Fund and other government organizations, for US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Labour Intelligence Centre, which is intended to include partners from industry and academic communities, and the Baltic Chambers have announced that a Special Labour Intelligence Committee will be established.
This month DARPA (e.g. the Agency for Advanced Research Projects) announced about US$ 2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing in labour intelligence research over $100 million per year.
However, in the coming months nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of labour intelligence.
Macedonians shall vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country by the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would be an act that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece which blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name means claims to Greece and urged Macedonia to join NATO and the EU.
While both Governments agreed to propose a new name, the opposition nationalists claim that the change in the name would damage the ethnic identity of most Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanovas said he would not vote in the referendum, and the closing campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter's activity would reach a minimum of 50 per cent, which would require the entry into force of the referendum.
Question of referendum on the ballot card: "Are you behind NATO and EU membership after agreeing with Greece?"
Supporters for the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries affected by the loss of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, the Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said that they would respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The name to be changed to a majority of the two-thirds of the necessary in Parliament.
The State Elections Commission reported that there were no reports of infringements by 13 hours.
However, electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent of Parliament's recent elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, the head of Skopje for 62 years.
Mr Zaevas of Macedonia, his wife, Zorica and his son Duško vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country in order to open the way for entry into NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulled the gates against the ceilings built by the late referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads and not enter the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
- We're not a real country, but we have a sense of humor.
If we do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the integration of Eureka."
Prime Minister Zaevas said that NATO membership in Macedonia, where unemployment rates reach more than 20 per cent, would attract such necessary investments.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are comfortable with the EU and NATO," Zaevas said after his vote.
He said that the "Yes" result would be "the guarantee of our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Research Institute on Monday, 30 to 43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required activity of voters.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television Telema, 57 per cent of respondents were prepared to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70 per cent said that the vote was "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, 50 per cent of voters have to take part in more than one vote.
If the referendum had not been reached, this would have been the first serious failure of the probationary government policy since it took over the government in May.
View: "Manchester City" player Sergio Aguero will win all the Brighton defense and profit gain
Sergio Aguero and Raheema Sterlingas won the Brighton defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, won the victory of 2:0.
At Aguero's 65-minute price, it seemed incredibly easy.
Argentinian polar bear received a shell in the middle of the field at the beginning of the division.
Before moving into an open field, he spent between three Brighton fighters.
Aguero then visited four red toy players.
He tried for one fighter, before that, a number of others were surrounded by the "Brighton" crime scene.
Then he transferred the ball to the army where Sterling was.
The English side once again returned the tower of Aguero from the scene of the punishment and this right-hand leg started the hole on the right-hand side of the door network with the help of "Brighton" user Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Pepas Guardiola told journalists.
- We said he was playing 55-60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We've been able to see that moment he won the prize."
However, Sterlings has helped the first to push Sky Blues forward in this Premier League.
The entry has been received 29 minutes.
During the attack, Aguero received a bullet in the direction of the Brighton area.
On the other side of the border between the two enemies, he gave a beautiful gift to Leroy Sane.
Sane’s muscles pushed the ball forward until Sterlings turned toward the further edge.
"Sky Blues" was launched in front of the door just before leaving the area.
On Tuesday, 12 p.m., "City" will meet with Hoffenheim at the Championships in the arena of Zinsheim "Rhein-Neckar" (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After the Nationals were released from the open pockets, there was no need to be forced for new important reasons.
The competition won by Scherzers is expected to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the opportunity to remain in open competitions; in the National League of West, they are one point lined with Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Rockies" last Friday's score 5:2 wins "Nationals" at least has already ensured the chance of getting an easier guide, but it will still have to work to ensure the right to play first division.
"Well, and we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to get out of the area, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where people and other teams are gathered, will probably be in the highest level we can reach this year.
Why aren't you ready?"
The initial composition of the command "Nationals" on Sunday is not yet announced, but in this case they are clearly ready to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be composed of 34 in this building, will take up the training course of the year and will take up the position on his usual rest day on Sundays.
Statistics for this season in Washington, D.C.: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 cars during 220 2/3.
Trupas speaks the language in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the mid-citizen elections, the President is directly concerned about the situation regarding the appointment of Mr. Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All we got will be on the table on November.
The most important choices in life remain for five weeks.
It's very important, I don't run... but really run, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he went on: "You see this sad, sad group of democracies, you see how this is happening right now.
And they're trying to restore power by any means, you see how it's down like a picture.
They don't care what they hurt, what they go through to get power and control; this is what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "increase and stop".
"You see this in the last four days," he said, calling democracy "the wicked, the terrible, the downtrodden and the unrighteous."
He mentioned the Senate Courts Committee, referring to the name of Senator Dianne's Feinstein, which led to large audience ovaries.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Do you want to run the document?
Oh, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was a really dirty body language – the simple body language of everything I've seen."
The librarians have lost a variety of opinions.
They do not tolerate open - minded opinion
When the Momentum activists voted in my local party because of their mistrust, I say that they needed to monitor it.
Finally, I am the newest of the Liberal parliamentarians who have been told that I am not interested - and this is what I have said.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was suffering from similar burnouts because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
My mistrust was expressed when I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironic, of similar issues that Jeremy did not meet with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour report said on Friday that "we want many members to attend the meetings and that the meetings are productive."
Most of those eight-year-olds when I was a local parliamentarian of the Liberian Party, the Friday evening GC meetings were the same.
Unfortunately, today many of the tons of meetings are not exactly the same as the 'slower, happier' policy promises that have long been forgotten, even if they have already been implemented.
It is increasingly evident that another opinion is not tolerated in the Leiborist Party and that each opinion is assessed according to whether it is accepted under the leadership of the Party.
This began soon after the party leader became Jeremy, and my colleagues, as I had previously believed, began to believe that I would join the 180-degree camp and follow opinions that I had never agreed with, either on national security or on the EU common market.
When I speak only to the public – and even if I don’t care about anything – social networks are trying to investigate the damages caused by my withdrawal, the central policy is being undermined, and I'm told that I'm not a part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I was followed by more than a few of my colleagues because I have political comments to make.
I am amazed at the professionality and the strength of my colleagues who have to maintain a high level of sexual and racial abuse every day.
One of the most disturbing things of this political era is how the damage has become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbynas said last week that the Leiborist Party should break the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we do not have the same party of views, and with each 'distrust' procedure or change of the electoral system, this party will make it even worse.
Over the last two years, I have received much advice that encourages me not to give up, not to speak so loudly, and then to me, "It will be all right".
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Liberian party 32 years ago, as a scientist, who was challenged by the Government of Thatcher because of the fact that my entire class of schools was affected by that word, I have sought to provide better public services to those who are most in need of it — whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my policies, including recent elections.
No Nottingham East should have been surprised in any way by my political opinions and inconsistencies with the current leaders.
For those who have encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, from which it is affected by households, businesses and public services, I do not feel the desire to clean up time and energy for my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
But in fact, one acquaintance I have for my voters is Nottingum Momentum: I am pleased to be able to serve you and promise that no offenses about rejection or political precision will keep me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and all your best interests.

"Air"- "Melrose" - 38:17 Unimplemented "Air" holds table surfaces
Two recent tests have resulted in the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won this triumphal spectacle in the series of Tenent's Premierships.
Now the team is sitting on the top of the table – the only failed.
Finally, they were given an uncompromising defense and the opportunity to make good use of the opportunity, so the trainer Peter Murchie could really feel satisfied.
"We've put all the tests through all the strikes that have taken place so far, and we're still not working, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr" showed good, players used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, which was successfully completed by Fraziera Climo, led "Air" to the front, but the yellow card to Rory Hughes, which was released into the area by "Warriers", allowed Melrose to collect numbers and Baggot stopped the test of results.
The climate increased the advantage of "Air" when, in the middle of the riot itself, profit scored points and resulted in a personal test by helping "Air" against the interruption to reflect the result 17:5.
However, Melrose’s second call did not start well, and Patrick Anderson’s test, which successfully ended Baggota, reduced the gap to five points.
The rounds had been stopped for a long time because Ruaridhe Knottas had suffered a severe trauma and was clearly released on the streets. The still waiting "Ayr" continued to move forward when Stafford McDowall's test ended successfully.
Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to use player overdrafts, but Bruce Colvine's test was unsuccessful after the heavy pressure was over.
The home team player returns, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he stopped the climate without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the line of punishment for the remaining Air ground.
As a result, the climate ended its test, as it had been almost since the start of the refurbishment, after Kyle's Rowe kept David Armstrong's questioning in the field camp and prevented the country's side from preparing the fifth house team's attempt to win points.
Still Game star, director ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The “Still Game” star Fordas Kieranas appears to be ready to move into the housing and food services sectors, explaining that he has been appointed as director of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old man in the BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, a script and plays with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphillu.
Dueta announced that the next nine seasons would be the last season of this journey, and it seems that Kierana is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to the official data, he became the Director of the Operation Mortgage Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the Scottish Sun sources realized that Kieranas were looking for ways to enter the "fashioned restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"We belong to the sea": Bolivian captive in the desert hopes that the court will open its way back to the waters
Seafarers patrol the marine ship's apartment in La Pase.
On the public buildings, the water is washed by the sand of the lake.
The seabed from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon rain forest echoes: “We are legally dependent on the sea.
It's our responsibility to get it back."
In all the dry areas of Bolivia, there are still live memories of access to water, which had to be sacrificed to Chile by resources during the 19th century.
In recent decades, the hopes of the past half-year have now been strongly reinforced, as after five years of consideration, Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice decision to be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, wants to achieve positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens throughout the country will monitor the publication of a TTT decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on the access of the state of Bolivia to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is awaiting a controversial electoral struggle for election, is also very interested in the end of the first day's decision.
“We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific Ocean again,” he called for the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that there is little hope that the court will make a decision that will be favorable to Bolivia, even if it does.
The United Nations institution established in the Netherlands is not able to designate the territory of Chile and has indicated that there are no possible results of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard, whether it has been ‘not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia was able to do something crazy, the last four years could break it back.
"The current Bolivian administration has illegally raised this issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She believes that any remains of Chile’s good will have been destroyed by the terrible moral retortor of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will talk for a while, but after all this discussion will be very difficult.
The country has not changed from 1962 to 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrígueza Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court decision was taken very quickly.
"The next day, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile and to end the 139-year-old dispute in order to benefit each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never promise the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must agree with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear pollution is possible only if it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho is confident that his people will never abandon the first nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
On Saturday he spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He invited the United States to comply with its promises made by the leaders of the developing countries during the Singapore meeting.
His comments were made at the time when State Secretary Mikeãs Pompeo, the king, intended to renew the strict nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu Singapore.
Ri says that "a total dream" is that, in the course of sanctions and the United States, a declaration on the end of the Korean War could ever be ignored.
Washington refuses to accept the declaration if Pchenjan does not take the necessary steps first.
And Kimas and President Donalda Trumpas of the United States want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skeptical view that Pchenjana does not really intend to reject Arsenal, which the country looks like, is seen as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the oven for the second Kim and Trumpo meeting.
The Paris model show revealed that the latest trend is massive head mass, and they quickly cover the closest fashion shops
If you want to supplement your flight collection or fully protect from the sun, this trend is just like you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Brownæs presented a wide range of extremely large head coverings in their 2019 summer and summer collections, and he just made Paris model week views available in his style.
These particularly useless planes blocked the social network of Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creatures on the floor.
The unique Valentino creature was a large body-coloured bird, dressed in a wide, pinkish country that reminds you of manoeuvres.
Other abnormal accessors were lured into the trunks, the butterfly and even the pineapple – but they did not create to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Brownæs also presented a collection of changed cats – at the same time for Helovin.
Many of the colorful cats were tied in with snakes and more prominent Hannibal Lecter than a high model.
One of the creatures appeared as a member’s suit, with a rope and a water eye, and the other was the primary layer of frozen ice.
And if you have sex with this large size fashion trend – don’t ask.
Stylus experts are able to see that these huge quantities can reach shops.
Big airplanes were still popular with La Bomba, and today's flights with two legs were all over the country – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand of goods, which created very useless flights that blocked all social networks, on the floor released another huge creature – a modern flood plague, almost the same size as the manekene that carries it in the washing suit.
Red-coloured red-coloured ruffs, dressed in pink-haired cats and white-haired gloves, became the exclusive highlight of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris fashion week.
Garsenybian stylist Lukeås Armitageʼa said to the FCC: "I believe that the next summer after the sale of large airplanes and floats, because the designer had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories."
John Edwards: “Planning is an important skill for citizens of the world”
In 2018, the independent schools improved academic success records, not only in 2018, but also in 2018, and once again demonstrated the outstanding results of the examinations, which only further strengthened individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community benefits.
When there are more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) aim to provide their students and their parents with services at the highest level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and further education, their chosen careers and their being citizens of the world.
In the education sector, which can create and implement a planned school programme, we see that today’s languages remain popular and want to be selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can communicate with a person, he can understand you.
If you speak with him in his own tongue, speak from his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just push English if we want to find relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of recent studies this year, we can say that languages are excellent at the top of popularity and in independent schools at best maintenance rates.
Of all 68 per cent of foreign-speaking students, they received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools which are SCIS members showed that 72 per cent of students received the highest A evaluation through a mandarin language examination, 72 per cent of the highest A evaluation received the highest German language, and 69 per cent of those who had learned French, and 63 per cent of those who had learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are spending time paying for foreign languages in an essential way that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a choice are now considered to be the same as those of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent school programmes.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 per cent of the workers had insufficient language skills for all the reasons why jobs were difficult for them.
Thus, language skills become increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Since the possibility of employment will be very dependent on languages in the future, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
No matter what role a person will play in learning another language, he will be much more than others in the future if he has the skills needed to live all his life.
In order to be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a number of languages learning will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 in which more than 4,000 UK adults participated, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a bilingual percentage of people, i.e. 15 per cent.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in learning languages.
By learning a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities to work wisely.
In Scotland, each school is divided according to the language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be many languages from which you can choose to attend an independent school, with a training staff and specialists in this field.
Schools are independent when they are prepared to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not surprising that in today’s business environment, language remains vital for the future of a country, so it is also necessary to reflect it in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered as "international skills of communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, variety and results for young Scotland.
That's what you need to do.
John Edwards is Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron's next Sunday San Diego will start the "Lakers" debate
The generals had little to wait for to see how LeBronas James started the season of Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lukeás Waltons reported that James was playing on the opening of the Sunday season with the Denverie "Nuggets" San Diego.
But the exact minute of the game, I don't know yet.
"This will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," said Waltons on the official Lakers website.
Lakers, rapporteur for Mikeâs Trudellas on Twitter, said that James was likely to be playing a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during six bi-month shifts.
"At this stage of the career I don't need bi-monthly expectations to be prepared," he said.
Trumpo language in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donalda Trumpas launched his campaign in Vilinge, West Virginia this evening.
This is especially true of the five planned Trumpo languages of the next week, including arrests in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting in favour of the suspension procedure for the submission of a candidate for the Supreme Court chosen by him, the Council intends to concentrate its support on the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the vote in November to lose control of Congress.
This evening will be held in Trumpo in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trumpo language in Vilinge, West Virginia, planned at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trumpo language on the Western Virgin Internet in the following edition of YouTube.
The House of Lords will soon leave this week the subject of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh, because she has been deeply impressed by the suspicions of improper sexual conduct when Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate's submission until the week before the FTB conducted the study.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help the republics gain some strength by coming to the November elections.
Therefore, President Trumpo's campaign representatives say that the next week's objective, as announced by Reuters, is "to empower volunteers and supporters who are trying to reach and expand the majority of those in the Senate and the Houses of Representatives".
"The control of Congress is so important in its agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible, as a very hot campaign season begins," said the representative of the Trumpo campaign, who was unable to reveal his name.
"The evening language planned at the Wesbanco arena should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsbergo media," says the Metro News of West Virginia.
On Saturday, Trumpas will be visited the second time in West Virginia, in a country where more than 40 percentage points were won in 2016.
The House is trying to help the candidate for West Virginia to the Senate, the Republic of Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the survey, is in the low rankings.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that he had to come to the president in order to push him up to the rankings," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Tower Tournament: U.S. Command has been attacked by soldiers and is expected to enter the ranks of the units on Sunday
After three personal steps on Saturday, the fourth can be like what was needed during this Ryder Tower tournament.
Such a success is well-founded, but players really believe it, especially in such atrocities as this.
So on which side is success now?
"They were the first six points, and now four, so I think we can keep it up to this success," Jordan Spiethas said, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is the first one to have four points of weight and is still waiting for twelve rounds.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, is left, and they don't miss him, no longer talking about the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each picked up three points from four.
The pressure was not effective from the beginning to the end and did not precipitately.
As these field crossings continued, there was still a voice. To finish the fourth game at levels, Thomas won two points from two possibilities.
After winning their victory in this game on the 15th floor, he was accompanied by similar shouts, which said that the American forces are not yet on their way.
"It is only necessary to concentrate and care for your needs," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
Up to the successful end, 18 dolls.
The only players to collect more points for Spietha and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Ryder Tower.
It is a change, but it is strikingly rare that four points from Europe have been collected from four possibilities and can be peaceful.
"Molywood" was the only time for additional loads not only on Saturdays but also on the mornings, on Fridays and on Fridays.
These events are going on and the alarming audience reaction only confirms that they and those players who will be successful next day and that no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who have the opportunity to ensure Europe's victory by the last sunsets in the Le Golf National field.
It would be good if you could reach both of them at the same time.
Although we are talking about Europe's fame, it's too early.
Bubba Watson and Webbas Simpson played short games with Sergio Garcia, the morning of four football players when he was married to Alex Noren.
In addition, two additional strains were added during the first nine series of grantors to the Spanish and Swedish in a disaster from which they were unable to escape.
However, no one will be out of trouble on Sunday.
Four rounds and four rounds are so interested in monitoring the interaction between pairs, the advice they give and which they do not give, and the fact that the strategy can change more quickly.
Europe played better as a team, so it came to a close first, but this fourth phase showed that the US team had a fight rate that was sometimes doubted, especially in countries.
The last day of the "Ryder" harvests Europe first 10:6
The last day of the ryder harvest will be achieved by having a significant weight after the fourth stage of the six-day period before the United States 10-6.
Encouraged by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario’s gift, he continued to value the atmosphere by winning two victories against the heavy fighter Tiger Woods and taking the first four points at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorno, in order to preserve the trophies that had been lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on the fourth floor of the morning before the failed player half of America and finished the score 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four matches when two matches were won but could not overcome the score
Jimo Furyko's side needs eight points from the 12 unit games on Sunday to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points from the series when along with Molinary Molinary, Molinary doubled after the sedentary week, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four games in the history of the Ryder Towers.
With Woods and Patrick Reed's success in four, they did not hesitate to break the confidence of Woods and New American Briton Dechambeau even better.
Woods, this was not the case with two six-day games, at some point showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of their games in four, seven of them in a row.
Justin Roseʼa went on Thursday morning and returned to play with his partner Henrik Stanson on Thursdays; they succeeded 2:1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third place in the world's rankings.
In the southern part of Paris, Europe is not all over the world.
Three times the winner of the Jordan Spiethas and Justin Thomas launched an American cartel, winning two points on the sixth day.
Four ball games they won an easy win result 2:1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and the fourth match won Poulter and Rory McIllroy's score 4:3, the uncomplicated ball hit the first two pairs.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder team managed to overcome four points by going into one match, although the Furyko side would protect levels in order to keep the trophies.
Although he was in the second place for two days, he succeeded them the following day.
North Korea says that there is no way of being unilaterally untrustworthy
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations that the continued sanctions would undermine their confidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not be unilaterally exempt from nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Assembly of North Korea that in recent years there have been "significant good-will measures", for example, halting nuclear missiles tests, establishing a nuclear test base and committed to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But the same answer from the US was not received by us," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not in any way be the first to face any international danger."
As long as Ri has already heard North Korea's complaints about the phased approach to nuclear repression against Washington, which would have been awarded to North Korea in the stages of its action, his statement has been dismissed by the fact that he has not completely rejected the idea of bilateral harassment as Pchenjan had done before.
Ri commented on a joint statement made by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trupas during the first meeting of the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kimas committed to working on the "Separation of Korea" and Trupas sought to secure North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks the formal end of the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States says that Pchenjan must first refuse his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US requires nuclear destruction first and further pressure on sanctions to achieve its objective by means of binding methods, even by rejecting the declaration on the end of the war," Ri said.
“To think that we can be punished by sanctions is the same as that of those who don’t care about the child of utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
They did not mention plans for the second Kim and Trumpo meeting, which U.S. leader in the United States stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings of the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months: "If another country had accepted the issue of nuclear destruction in South Korea rather than in the United States, the issue of nuclear destruction in South Korea would not have been such an aclicity."
However, the tone of Ri's speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that when Mr. President of the Blog, the trumpet called the Qumé "Mr. Rocket", preparing a suicide mission, turning North Korea's rocket into the US was totally inevitable.
This year the United Nations Trompas, who oversowed North Korea with a "total destruction" of North Korea, attacked Kim for taking steps towards decommissioning, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the requirements for nuclear decommissioning.
On the third day, Trupas said that there was no time schedule for it, and he said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said that the UN Security Council should reimburse Pchenjan for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mikeãs Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must be carried out without any delay until a complete nuclear investigation approved by final evidence is carried out."
The Security Council has all voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in order to prevent the financing of Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri U.S. General Assembly meetings and later said that he would visit again in Pchenjane next month in order to clear the hole for another meeting.
In North Korea three times this year, Pompey has been on its way, but the last trip has been unsuccessful.
In July he left Pchenjan, saying that all the progress was only to make North Korea declare that it had introduced "gangsteric requirements".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea wanted to install a rocket base and a nuclear complex if the United States would take "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said that the "appropriate measures" he sought were security assurances that Trump had called for Singapore, and that it would lead to normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more, to fight against growing macaw culture studies, to use caffeine and not to sleep at night
One academic found that students at the world’s best universities often do not even have basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charlesʼas Czeisleris, Harvard Medical School sleep professors and Brigam Sichi, Women's Hospital Specialist, prepared a course that, he said, is the first type of America.
The encouragement to prepare for this course came after speaking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this to me only now, in the last study years?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleeping, and that surprised me," he said, "The Telegraph."
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep really helps to achieve academic and sports results, improve overall self-esteem.
Professor of Mental Health at Harvard Medical School and director of the Department of Health Services at the University said that the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that students are very sleepless during the week.
The duration course shall cover an interactive range of tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a shared room where students can push a cup of coffee, wadding, trains and books and thus learn about caffeine, the effect of light on sleeplessness on sports results and how important it is to sleep quickly.
In the second section, participants learned how long-term sleep failure could increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
The student city map with interactive icons, which encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We believe this will not change the behavior of the students at once.
But we think they have the right to know – just like you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke”, Professor Czeislers explained.
Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to growing sleep shortages, he says.
"To ensure that the students have had enough and quality enough sleep, they should be the secret weapon in combating stress, exclusion and anxiety, which he spoke, even in order to avoid increasing weight, as sleeplessness is the result of a brain connection to the healing process, so the students are always feeling hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when he attended one of his first classes in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course of access to the city of the students.
He wishes that another step will encourage all secondary students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competition institution.
Professor Czeisleris recommended that students set a waiting time when the goal is to go to bed, as well as to travel, and to protect the harmful effects of light from the harmful effects of light published by electronic devices and lighting of light gods, because they can wipe out your circular rhythm from the balance, so it can be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 "Rangers": Men's money has been canceled by Gerard's men
"Rangers" experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai managed to win the failed Steven Gerard score 1:0.
"Ibrox" hoped to win his first victory in the wake of the February triumph of St. Johnstone, but Gary Holto's team won Gerard's second victory over the 18-year-old leader's post and now the last team has already left eight points from the leading leaders of the race "Hearts".
My contribution remained for seven minutes until the break, but without the inspiration of the Rangers game, there was no way to compare the result.
Rangers is now headed into the sixth place, Livingston has moved into the third and from Hibernian is left with only one exception.
And "Rangers" doesn't end it, because the most immediate thing from tribal butter came to the head of the side judge Calumus Spence and violated it.
Gerard made four changes that allowed Air to circle and moved into the semi-final of the Betfred Tower.
On the other hand, Holtas believed this same one that took a point from Hearts last week and would trust him how well his unity caused opponents in each step.
The Rangers dominated the ball under control, but it had Livingston more.
They were able to enter a second minute already when Menga, in close contact with Menga, transferred the ball to Allan McGregorero's door-free Scotty Pittman, but the security broke his chance to turn the ball away from the door.
After Keaghan Jacobs' release squadrons arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his procurator, Alan Lithgowas, asked for the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third was just hope, not belief in their game.
Five minutes later, Alfred Morelos found himself in prison when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson handed down the Colombian complaint.
In the first lift, Rangers managed to push only twice, but an ex-Ibrox user Liam Kelly took off or rescued Lassana Coulibaly's heavy head or a light Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute assessment may have not been in line with the expected course, no one will need them to have done it for their own efforts.
"Rangers" has not yet succeeded in defeating the smart Jacobs defense.
Scotts Arfields did not complain when Declan Gallaghers handed over the money to Scott Robinson, who spent his spare time and handed it over to Menga for easy closure.
During the break Gerrards took action by turning Coulibaly into Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security beat Morelos, but after striking Kelly escaped the famine.
Livingston included guests in a game that you like – with the distant transfers of the Lithuanian and Halkett.
The Holto team was finally able to increase its weight, but McGregors was ordered by Jacobs after Lithgowas was released from the camp.
After the change to the field, player Glennas Middleton once again appealed for punishment after meeting with Jacobs, but Thomson did not.
Almamanacha: The manufacturer of the Geigeri number
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanacho: on September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and DAUGIAU... that day in Germany was born by the physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geigeris.
Gegeris invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The resulting device was later created known as Gegeri's number.
Since then this device has become a world science hit, and later popular culture hit, when the 1950s film Bells of Coronado played a little less famous by scientists Royʼus Rogers and Daleʼas Evans:
The husband says: “What is it after all?
Rogers: “This is the number of Geigers used for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these ears, you can actually hear how atoms work, absorb the radioactive effect on minerals."
Evansas said, "No, now it's really crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the release of his name is still alive.
New vaccines from cancer may teach the immune system to develop bad cells
The new vaccine from cancer can teach the immune system to develop and kill bad cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells – this is part of the treatment
Method includes the release and replacement of immune cells from the patient's laboratory
The cells can then "see" proteins that are different from many cancer forms and are re-injected
The test vaccine gave many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman who has been treated with this vaccine, who has learned to recognize the immune system, has had an ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the release of immune cells from the patient and their change in the laboratory, then the cells can see white cells that form her2 type of cancer and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Betesdo (Merileland) said: "Our results allow us to think we have a very promising vaccine."
" HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and direct nerves," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells were obtained from patients and were paid to adjust to cancer cells was successfully adapted to leukaemia.
Kanyës Westas started a study with Trumpa, covering the MAGA Kepurait, following its show with SNL show.
Well, it's not over.
After an indisputable exhibition of the Saturday Night Live study, the audience was delighted by the smiles of Kanyeën West, who praised US President Donald Trumpa; he said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after the third song, Ghost Town, during which he joined the kopurait with the name Make America Great, continued to mourn democracy and expressed support for Trumpa.
"How can you believe the trumpet when it's found?"
Well, if I'd been worried, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL began with a commission scene where Mattas Damons withdrew from the committee of the Senate of Bretto Kavanaugh's witness on charges of sexual misconduct presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this has not been broadcast yet, the film material with the West Replica was posted on social networks by comical Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock's tried this entry from West.
In addition, Westas complains to the auditors that he had non-maldonisms in his head because of his headache.
“They were staring at me in my arms.
He said don't go there with that cephurite.
They're getting rid of me!
They said I got the button, and he'd call it "Washington Examiner."
Westa continued: “Do you want to see what the fire is? He asked his father’s superman kepper, which means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love."
At least two times, his statements were made in a non-conforming audition, and the members of the SNL transliteration appeared to be meeting as reported by "Variety." One person in the media said: "In all the study there was a death depth."
Westas was invited to quickly change the singer Arian Grande, as her former boyfriend Macas Miller died a few days ago.
Westas introduced many to his show, during which he performed the song "I Love it", calling for Perrier's costume.
He received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who published a post on Twitter: "One of the most powerful spirits for a man: THE APPLICABLE MINISTER."
But the interviewer, Karen Hunter, published a post on Twitter that Westas just "was himself and this is unusual".
"But I choose a NEREMTI person (by buying his music or his clothes or by holding his "mean") whose beliefs are a harmful ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Prior to the start of this rehearsal, Twitter announced that it had changed its name and that it is now officially known as Kanye Westas.
He was not the first creator who changed his name, but went the same way that Grandy had already sold, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Greaty.
His colleague, Snoop Dogga, originally called Snoop Lion, changed his name to the symbol and later became known as Prince’s.
Debts to kill victims at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man was sentenced to death in the morning in Belfast, where he was beaten with a stick.
According to the police, this incident occurred in Balihamore.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the judges of Belfast on the first day.
The Office of the Prosecutor shall review the charges.
The "Susto Wars" Star Next Harrington criticises a distorted view of manship
Another Harrington voiced as a rocking character John Snau HBO in a series of fantastic events about the middle of the "Susto War".
But 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of the game, he says that such roles in the screen are often worth young boys to feel that way, while they should be strong enough to be respected.
Speaking "Sunday Times Culture", Kitas said that, in his opinion, "something's wrong", and raised a question about how to deal with the problem of extreme humanity at #MeToo era.
Another, who recently led a 31-year-old "Susto War" colleague at Rose Leslie's star, admitted that this subject is "hard to deal with".
"I feel that I am now deeply affected by this subject. Where did we make a mistake when we raised men?" he asked.
"What do we learn from growing men when we face such problems?"
Another believes that some of the men's bona fide could be responsible for television because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is born?
What does it teach on television or on the street to convince young people that they must recognize such a man?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how can we change this?
Obviously we made a mistake with the young men."
In the interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any "Susto Wars" contests or events when the next summer's series was over, and said that "we are almost there already."
Since November, another film has been released by Samo Shepard in a modern version of "True West". It is a film about filmmakers and his brother's background.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he was created by the “Susto Wars”, where he met his wife, Rose.
"In this series I met a woman, so in this sense the series gave me a family and a future life," he said.
The award of "Emmy" in the most prestigious series Rose played Igrita, the object of John Snow's love.
The day came in June 2018 in the family property of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS infection among citizens.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of newly infected people were transmitted by sexual means, and this differs from the statistics of the past.
Traditional HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has decreased almost to zero by the number of representatives of the health authorities of China during a conference in the province of Junano.
In China, however, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a major issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was still decriminalised in 1997, but discrimination among LGBT people is widespread.
Since the country has higher levels of condoms, 70–90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually lead women.
The majority of cases of infection are due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters says that employees have stolen the data of the Republican senator, "hazardous fog" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Representative Maxine Waters rejected the claim that one of its employees published personal information on the pages of the lawmakers 'Wikipedia' of three U.S. Republic senators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles believed that the charges were made by extra right-wing experts and websites.
"Males, honey and once again no honey," said Waters in his "Twitter" section.
It is reported that there were also U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike’s Lee and Orino Hatcho, both from Jutas, addresses and telephone numbers.
The information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitolian language during the trial of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the President of the Supreme Court for Britain, Kavanaugh.
The information received showed how much later these three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
‘Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState’ reported that the IP address to which the source of these entries was established was linked to the Waters Office and the information of the Waters staff was disclosed’, is reported from the Capitolia.
"These unfounded arguments are absolutely uncertain and absolute lies," continues Waters.
‘My staff member whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these disturbing and misleading allegations, in no way is responsible for the determination of this information.
These false claims are absolutely false and absolute lies."
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, as well as from the press of former White Rome’s representative Ari Fleischer.
"This negative side of the line," Fleisher wrote.
"It says that she does not have enough independence to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be punished.
He shouldn't stand up.
He should not doubt the cause of the accused.
He should be calm and calm."
Fleischeris seems to have tried to compare the Waters reaction with the criticism of the democratic judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too picky at the Thursday meeting.
The Republican candidate Omaras Navarro, who participated in the medium-term election campaign to change Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That, if not mellow," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters claimed that its office informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies of these false charges.
"We will ensure that the organizers will be able to explain, it will continue to be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees without exception."
A look at the comedy "Johns English again" – a glimpse of the snowflakes with Rowana Atkinson
The tradition has already been looking for "Brexit" ideas in any British film. The same is true of John Ingleša's French comedy "Johnis Ingleš" was started to show in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to the screen with the comedy "John's English" comedy.
Will this red-haired autosatire about how we were apparently surprised to become a new national export option?
In any case, the incompetence John English has a second chance to cast into the surface of the silent truth ► the very name clearly shows that this comedy is intended for non-English-speaking cinematographer regions.
Of course, this quail secret agent, who, although claiming to be in the lead, acquired and some both inspector Clouseau's properties, Mr. Byno's short-compensation with the man, is surprised by the use of the theme "Ugnies" used during the opening of the 2012 London Olympic Games ceremony.
He also has a little bit of reason for characters about a passenger and a secret man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once showed in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV.
This latest film of John English has several beautiful glasses.
I liked it when John English came to the rescue, wearing medium-sized costumes and shoes, and a mangrove came to his village.
Comedian Atkinson's talent is clear, but the humor itself appears to be relaxed and changing overt, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and "Mission is impossible", include elements of comedy.
I don't think John's English experiences seem as exciting and as much like Atkinson's background dances to Mr. Byna.
The most common issue at this time is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberspace was successfully penetrated into the very secret Internet of the British snowflakes and revealed all the identity of the British snowflakes in this area, resulting in an overexhaustible agency.
This is the last letter to the Prime Minister, a posthumous and camped character tower, which still suffers from disturbing political instability: Emma Thompson from Teres May, who sees everything that can be done, but in the scenario the good stuff is not much.
The wise advisers will inform her that the identity of all her agents is revealed and that she will have to search for people among those who have retired.
This means that you will have to call on John English himself, the school director who is currently working at some request agency, but who provides illegal lessons as to how to work with a secret agent. There were several good jokes when English offered the School of Rock type degree Academy.
English is sent back to Vaithol to discuss the unusual situation and it agrees with its general Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man who is in charge of a submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, who is playing a girl in high school, seems to be underutilized.
Then Betman and Robin, able to collect all things in His Majesty's Secret Service, takes action again and meets with Olga Kurylenk, called a fatal beauty by Ophelia Buletova.
A charismatic billionaire, who claims to be able to solve the problem of British computers, is a photographer Jason Volta, who plays Jakeãs Lacy.
English and Bough start their odysser: they are preparing for fire at the French restaurant, causing chaos in the famous Voltos yacht, and England begins full anarchy, trying to use virtual reality ears to get to know the interior of Volto's house.
All the stairs were clearly kept in this last series, but whatever it's fun or wild, all of this reminds us of children's television.
It's a great average.
As for other films of John English, I couldn't hide my thoughts: the little British movie industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Liberian Party has a negative plan for the British for four days of work a week, but to be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's labist party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company leaders to share the savings generated by the labour intelligence (DI) revolution by giving their employees one day free.
This would allow workers to enjoy three days a week and to pay the same amount at home together.
The source says that this opinion is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to build up the country's development for workers are welcome.
The four-day shift to work week has also been welcomed by the Conference of the Professional Unions as a means of benefiting workers from the benefits of the changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Liberian Party's sources, The Sunday Times, said: "The review of policy provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not take place overnight, but four working days a week corresponds to a party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of workers, as well as a common party industry strategy."
The Liberal Party is not the first to promote this idea; four working days a week during the 2017 general election campaign and the Green Party.
However, not all the Leiborist parties support this idea at this time.
The representative of the Liberal Party said: "The four working days week is not a party policy and this is not discussed in the party."
The representative of the six-year government John McDonnellis used the opportunity to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Liberian Party conference last week.
Mr. McDonnellis said he was committed to withdrawing power from the 'safe dictators' and 'good farmers' in municipal services.
Such six-year-old Chancellor Plans also mean that current water companies shareholders may not benefit from their entire share because, given the fluctuation, the Liberian government can read something.
It also approved plans to include employees in company management and to create investment property funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of private sector corporate capital to employees and they could receive up to 500 GBP annual dividends.
Lindsey Grahams and John Kennedy answered the question "60 Minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanaugho could change their opinion
In the course of the investigation by the FTB on charges submitted to the judge of Brittany Kavanaugh, a final vote was taken for at least one week, whether it was assigned to the Supreme Court, and whether the facts of the investigation office could affect the opinion of any of the Republican senators so that they would not take it.
In the afternoon interview, Scottas Pelley, correspondent for the 60 minutes, asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could happen that the FTB will understand something that would change their opinion.
Sir, Senator Kennedy is more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replied J. Kennedy.
"As I said when I went to the meeting, I spoke to Judge B. Kavanaugh.
When this happened, I called him and asked him: “Did you do this?"
He answered firmly, firmly, without doubt."
So L. Graham's opinion, the director, would not change anything.
"I have decided about Bretto Kavanaugh, which should really create accusations," he says.
"For Dr. Ford, I don't know what was there, but I know one: Brittas is categorically negative," added L. Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one can confirm what it says.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think there's anything new to it."
What is the world’s citizens’ festival, and did it somehow contribute to poverty reduction?
This Saturday in New York will be held by the World’s Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and is aimed at eliminating poverty in the world.
For the past seven years in the Central Park of Great Lakes, the World’s Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but will also publish more information about the real purpose of the event – to eradicate the particular poverty by 2030.
The World's Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It will continue to be a global fight against poverty – international mediation groups that want to eradicate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a free VIP ticket), the concerters had to perform various tasks or actions, such as to engage in volunteer activities, send an e-mail to the world’s leader, call the phone, or somehow, to help to increase awareness of their objective of eliminating poverty.
But are the citizens of the world successful in pursuing this goal?
Is the idea of comparing people with a free concert will really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe this is just another so-called clickivism, fixed activism, for example – people think that you will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing a Twitter entry.
According to World Citizens' Festivalers, since 2011, the movement has recorded more than 19 million of its supporters, encouraging them to achieve many of the most diverse goals.
They claim that, under the pressure of these actions, world leaders have announced 37 billion US dollars' commitments and policy strategies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group indicated 390 commitments and declarations that have prompted the actions of the group that have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The number of funds provided by the group has already affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition is one of the main commitments of the United Kingdom – a partnership of investors and operators that seeks to "help children grow up and discover all their potential." With more than 4,700 world citizens on Twitter, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help the country solve the food problem.
"With the support of the United Kingdom governments, the supporters, the governments of countries and like you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve support for social injustice as a food shortage," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert held in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that, following the 5 000 calls for improving the food of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the "Military Power" project, to which the food intervention will reach 5 million women and children.
In reply to one of the DUKs, which asks, "Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly large poor person?"
The world’s citizens respond: “It’s a long and difficult journey — sometimes we’ll get into a club and get into trouble.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will succeed, because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, “The Weeknd”, Shawnas Mendesas, Cardi B, Janelle Monée – are a number of participants in this year’s event in New York.
As stated by the Secretary of the Interior, the United States may use a ship blockade to prevent Russian energy exports
"On the other hand, Washington can use a ship to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner.
R. Zinke says that Russia's participation in Syria, particularly when it acts at the invitation of the legal authorities, is a counter-text used in the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that Russia is moving towards the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zinke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States can do this on board a ship caught, can make sea routes open and, if necessary, can run a blockade, ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US 'Energy Consumer Voice'.
He further compared Washington's methods with those that apply when dealing with the issues concerning Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative of Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser responsibility to change the fuel," he said, and he also named Russia as a country whose entire economy depends only on late fuel.
These statements have shown D. Trumpo to the administration of the mission to increase its exports of reduced natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a better chance.
Therefore, D. Trumpo administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trumpa himself, are trying to convince Germany to break away from the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Dr. Trumpo, became a Moscow Wall.
Moscow once pointed out that the 11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double increase its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
According to Kremlin, the reason for the growing opposition to this project is only economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to pick suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novakas after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Secretary of State Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. took a stand against Germany's reactions, and once again it confirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main organisation of the German industry, the German Federation (BDI), urged the United States not to break up EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not support the move of a third State to our energy supply needs," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he has a serious discussion of his candidate during the presidential elections of 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he was seriously discussing the question of candidate to the presidents after the mid term elections.
During the Holjöko meeting at Masaçesetse E. Warren approved the opportunity to apply for a candidate.
"The year of women going to Washington to deal with our lost authorities, they have to go to the top post," she said in a rush.
"After 6 November I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
During a meeting at the city square, E. Warren supported President Donald Trumpa, saying he was taking the country in an inappropriate manner.
"I am very grateful for the way Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
E. Warren is publicly critical of Dr. Trump and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, E. Warren, published on Twitter, said that "there is no doubt that an FTB study needs to be conducted".
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of E. Warren's voters believe that it should not apply for presidentship in 2020.
According to a survey carried out by the political research centre of the University of Safoli and Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the estimated Masachuss voters said that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two per cent support its candidate.
The survey showed that more support is received by former Governor Devalas Patrick – 38 per cent support his potential candidate and 48 per cent say so.
The other names of representatives of the ruling Democratic Party in 2020 were discussed on the possible candidate: former Vice-President Joe Bidenas and Senator Bernie Sanders.
J. Bidenas said that the official decision would take place in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Donaldo Trumpo summary Sarah Palin is talking about the traumatic disorder of the Tracko Palin
Twenty-two-year-old Track Palinas, who had been in the military service for 26 years, passed away in Iraq.
On Monday night after an incident in the family, he was arrested and charged.
“See what my son lives with when he comes home every day, so another family who feels the effects of post-traumatic disorder, and some of the damage our soldiers have experienced,” she said to those who met at the Donaldo Trumpo Assembly in Talso, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest a denial of justice. She said that his sons and other veterans had “resurrectioned a short change in their hearts, they had returned to their hearts with doubts as to whether they would gain respect for what their fellow soldiers and laconies had done, and all the other soldiers had opened up to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilo, Alaska, to be charged with violence against his family and rape against his wife, as well as with the charges of being unable to report violence against his family with a gun and in the absence of a ship, as reported by Dan Bennett, the press representative of the Vasili Police Department.
18 countries and Colombia are supporting opposition to the new asylum-seekers' policy
Eight countries and Colombia look around to support the legal framework for a new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states in Washington and representatives of this district made comments on amicus curiae (the court consultant) to support the policy of asylum-seekers, the NBC News reported.
All applicants were named on the Grace before the Sessions launched by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy.
She said that her partner "and the members of his criminal gang" had been raped against her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace, on the basis of national law, described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States has received many requests for asylum as States to address the problems of permanent gains in the family of violence and violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was abolished by the 2014 Act of the Immigrance Appeals Council, which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the family to apply for asylum.
In its report on Friday, the Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racineʼas stated that the new policy "does not conflict with the laws of the state, federal and international for decades".
‘Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be taken taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this principle is violated by such a prohibition,’ says a friend of Curiae.
In this note, lawyers also say that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the country is harmful to the US economy, and that it is more likely that immigrants will engage in business and "will provide the necessary work services".
The General Prosecutor, Jeffas Sessions, pointed out June that immigration issues are not to be imposed on lawmakers who are refugees from the family and victims of domestic violence.
"The depth shall be granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or to certain political views," said J.Sessions in a June 11 policy report.
The asylum granted was never intended to address all the problems (not all serious problems) facing people around the world every day.
Once the number of victims has grown, Palu is desperately looking for the rest of the lives
The situation of the rest of the population is constantly deteriorating.
“The impact is very great,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, referring to her son’s angry son at the city’s evacuation centre in Palu.
‘The brakes do not stop transporting more and more bodies.
There's no clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their homes, collect waterborne objects, and try to save only what they can find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and 7.5 cases of earthquakes are drought - stricken.
Some of the victims, such as Dwi Haris, who have suffered from back and back injuries, are buried in the field of Palu military hospitals, and continue to treat patients with severe relapses in the field.
His eyes are filled with tears when he says that he is in the fifth high room of the hotel where he was living with a man and a daughter.
‘There was no time to save others.
I'll show you, I've stepped across the wall," said Dr. Haris "Associated Press" and added that he came with his family to the city to participate in the weddings.
"I hear the cry for help from a man, and it is far beyond me.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughters.
I hope she'll be all right."
U.S. Ambassador calls China by building propaganda
Last week, when the official Chinese newspaper published four-page advertising in the U.S. journal, destroying both US and Chinese trade benefits, U.S. Ambassadors in China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donaldas Trumpas referred to the last three days of the newspaper Des Moines Register of the Ajova State, which had been paid by China Daily, and called on China to affect the US Congress elections held on 6 November.
"D. Trumpo's claim that Pekinas is trying to influence US elections marking the new Washington campaign aimed at printing China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
Although it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently underway in the strengthening trade war, and both countries are struggling at tariffs for imports of other goods.
According to experts from China and the United States, the Chinese responsible tariffs were applied to exporters of Ajova and similar countries who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Branstadas, Ambassador of the United States of America in China, former Ajovos Governor and one of the major exporters of agricultural production in China, said that Pekinas had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
The following day, in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register, T. Branstada said that China "has been making more progress in printing propaganda in our press."
“By publishing the propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected freedom of speech and press in America and ordered adverted "Des Moines Register," wrote T. Branstadas.
“In the meantime, you will not find one of the opposite voices in the local Beijing Pressket and you will not produce a real video reflecting the different opinions that people of China may have about the disturbing economic trajectory of China, as the pressure is behind the strong support of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers has come out of the offer to print" his article, but he did not mention what it was.
Analytics warn: As we approach mid-elections, B. Kavanaugh's return to the Republican voter
Although many of the Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh, where there are several allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that this will hold a negative response during the upcoming Middle Ages elections, especially from women.
The situation is very strong, and many republics are already officially saying that they want to vote.
Such things can't be taken away any later," said Professor Grants Reeheris of the University of Siracúz in the sixth article published in Grants Reeheris.
Mr Reeheris questioned whether the last minute's call for Senator Jeffo Flake (R-Arisona) to launch an FTB study would be sufficient to discourage the fair voters.
“The women will not forget what happened last night – they will remember it both morning and November,” said the Washington newspaper, on Friday, the Chief Council of the Progressive Group of Views of MoveOn and the national representative of Karine Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, the protesters complained: "Lappritis is coming!" through a demonstration by the Senate, when the ruling republicans decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Kzip reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will take place across the country," said political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
People say it's already strong, and they're right.
But it could still strengthen the positions, especially between women's unsolved voters and young 18-29-year-old voters who, although not in favour of the President, often just don't vote."
Even before Mr. B. Ford's public testimony when he gave his detailed allegations of sexual harassment to the Supreme Court, the analyst said that if the Republic approved the candidate, this could lead to prejudice.
"The parties of the Republic have been deeply disappointed by this," said former President of the National Committee of the Republics Michael Steele's last week, according to the NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's or final vote, not only whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a lawyer, but also about how the Republic has managed this situation and how you have dealt with Mr. B. Ford," said the news channel Guyūus Cecilas, a group contributing to the democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans still don't agree on how much to believe after B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford's show, although it still has a little bit more support.
The New YouGov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents fully or effectively rely on Ch. B. Ford's evidence, and 35 per cent claim to be fully or effectively trusted by B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that B. Kavanaugh was really or was probably in love with the evidence, and only 30 per cent said the same about me about Mr. B. Ford.
At the time, the FTB was invited to investigate the charges made by Mr Ford and at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Mr Ford made a statement to the Senate's Committee last week, claiming that Mr. Kavanaugh had been shot in the face of an accident when she was 17 years old.
D. Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her his genitals on the evening they visited at the University of Jelio on 9th.
A scientist plans to create a new internet to resist Google and Facebook
The world network manufacturer Tim Bernersas-Lee is creating a new launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary producer Inrupt is a company whose work is based on the Bernerso-Lee open code platform ‘Solid’.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data are stored, as well as anyone and information to which they have access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Bernersas-Lee, the aim of Inrupt is to dominate the world.
"We have to do this now," he said about the start.
It's a historic moment."
The "Solid" technology-based software allows people to collect their own personal data online (e.g. personal online data store) – POD.
It may contain lists, lists of work, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
The Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will be available in a single browser at the same time.
The online retailer of personal data is unique in that only the user decides what and what information is available.
The company calls it a person's authority through data.
According to company Director-General John Bruce, Inrupt is the idea of providing resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
At present, the company consists of T. Bernersas-Lee, J. Bruce's, IBM purchased security platform, a number of programmers, who are unable to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, developers around the world can create their own decentralised software using the Inrupt tools provided on the website.
Bernersas-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google for changes that would turn up all business models at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
On Saturday, in the report on Media, Bernersas-Lee writes that Inrupt "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Bernersas-Lee transformed the Internet from the University of Masaçetti's technology to create a pool of scientists.
In recent months Berners-Lee had an impact on the discussion on Internet neutrality.
Even while working with Inrupt Bernersas-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Scientific Consortium, the Scientific Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel great optimism about this new journalist's era," added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vannas – The First World War of Victoria’s Cross of Spiritism
A 100-year-old prognosis in his home city was the only Anglican church clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I.
The grant was granted on 29 September 1918 by Mr. Bernard Vannas during the second half of the year.
Unfortunately, after four days of shepherding, a rapist disappeared, so he remained unaware that he had received a grant from the British military at the highest level.
At the time of the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire graffiti, two anchovies covered the stone.
One of the founders, Michael Vannas, said that the fact that the stone was covered at least 100 years after the dedication of the oldest crop was “extremely symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lieutenant led his battalion through the San Kent Canal "by means of a very well-solved smoke, by means of a massive explosion of situations and automatic fires."
Later he stepped into the attack line and "especially final" led the line first, and then one shot the situation and fired three bull fighters.
Colonel B. Vanna, a German rapist, resigned on 4 October 1918 – only more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vannas said his old-fashioned actions were "someone who is never close to himself, but at the same time a very inspiring thing."
After the council led by the new emperor of Brentwood, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vannas, helped the winner.
Michael Vannas said that he had great respect for being in the paradise and added: "The support of the true great crowd is a great support to many people."
The MMA stars didn't sleep all night to see "Bellator 206, but they had to fill "Kiaulyte Pepa"
Imagine: You don’t sleep all night to see the sweet “Bellator 206,” but you’re finally unable to look at the main region.
The San Chozé area had 13 battles, six of which were on the main map and were broadcast directly through the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, Gegarde Mousas and Rory MacDonald were surprised by the fact that the United Nations viewers had stopped broadcasting by Kiaudytė Pepa.
Some of the spectators, who were curious about it, were not surprised because they did not sleep until the morning.
In Twitter, one of the surgeons called the amendment of the transliteration into a small animation film "to some sick spot."
"In accordance with the rules laid down by the government, such content was inappropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, so it was necessary to launch a programme for children," answered Vice-President Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Marketing and Communication.
"Yes, "I heard Pepa."
President Scott Cokeris of Bellator said that there will be a future attempt to adjust the schedules based on the views of the United Kingdom.
"When I think about it again, I think we might be able to do it," said Cokeris.
"But at that time there are 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we couldn't solve this until our next day – their first day.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, after the change in the translation, there are many reports that were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, but we thought it was a technical mistake.
But this is not a matter of government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of battles up to five – as usual – and we're going to do it. We wanted to give the stars more, but it just didn't.
This is an impossible situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Thomas Daley felt confused about his sexual orientation
The Olympic sailor Thomas Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 athletes said only at primary school that they were not the same as everyone else.
For the first time, Lauren Laverne, in the Radio 4 series Desert Island Discs, said he had publicly talked about the rights of the leaders because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that his father’s kiss was not so important as to win the Olympic Games.
The permanent release of this long-term driver Kirsty Young has been out of work for several months.
In the first round of L. Laverne, who was asked to imagine that he was on his way to an unsatisfied island, T. Daley said growing up feeling better than everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: "Even these days this feeling of ambiguity and idiom has been inspired by the strengths that have helped me to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove the existence of this value so that he would not ignore the environment when they finally knew about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, in this year's games of the British National Association, took advantage of the opportunity to invite more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was going to talk about it to the public because he thought that he could live openly without any consequences, so he would also like to give others such hope.
The Triscard World Championship claimed that he was untrustworthy to fall in love with a U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance, who met him in 2013.
T. Daley has been in touch with the 20-year-old Oscar Laure, but he says that the age difference has never caused problems.
According to T. Dellay, when so many lives were so young – he was only 14 in his first Olympic, and yet three years after his father died of cancer – it was difficult to agree with anything that would be at the same age, but experienced the same height and depth.
In June, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents, T. Daley's perspective, according to him, changed completely.
“If you had asked me last night, I would have said that it is important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
The name of his son was the same as that of elderly Robert, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old.
Anton T. Daley, his father did not want to agree with his death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games, which he wanted to watch while sitting on the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that you didn’t live so long to sit in the first row,” said Mr. Daley.
“I was waiting for his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then I finally recognized that he was not harmless,” said Mr. Daley.
A year later, the athlete drew a bronze from the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew that I had spent my entire life on it – to jump into the water watching local Olympic Games – there was no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired the first choice of songs – Heather Small’s creation “Proud”, which reflected his feelings in the preparation of the Olympics and still has a pleasant smile on his skin.
"Desert Island Discs" via "BC Radio 4" is broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. in Britain.
Ph. Mickelson lost his form on Saturday's Ryder tournament
American Phil McCelson will get a record on Sunday, because he'll have 47 times already participated in Ryder's tournament, but in order not to succeed in moving, he'll need a lot of improved form.
Ph. Mickelson, who has been playing 12 times every two years during the hunts, on Saturday's fourth anniversary on the ground floor, Captain Jim Furykas.
At the start of the operation, as was often done in the United States, the main winner spent five times a day in the maintenance team, while the rest improved his technical field in order to correct obstacles.
Even at a very direct height of career, 48 athletes are not an ideal player in the Le Gold National fields, whose length of the heavy grass is very unpleasant to the unsatisfied.
In addition, just as the same explanation would not be enough to punish, in the wake of the turn of the game that will take place next Sunday, Ph. Mickelson played before the very target British tournament, Francesco Molinari, which, together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the four remaining Americans will be able to begin well with the next 12 units games, Ph. Mickelson's game can become absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, but he could not speak at all.
“ He well understood the role he played today, pushed me through the back of his arm and said that he was ready to play someone tomorrow,” said Furyka.
- He doesn't lack confidence.
He's on the most famous list of athletes and both in the past and this week has given these teams a lot.
Maybe I didn't think he was playing two balls.
I imagined more, but it went out like this, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
The next day, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and will become the most important player of Ryder's games.
It may be that this will mark the end of his Ryder career, as well as the non-compliant heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mikkelson belongs to 18 winners, 20 losses and seven levels, but Furyka says that his presence has also brought material benefits to the team.
He explained: “He's a funny, red, tired, he likes to feel from people and he's a great man who's hard to be in the command room with.
“I think that this week’s young players were also having a hard time with him, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjornas knows that a great deal can be done quickly
Mr. Thomas Bjornas, European commander of the team, knows from experience that a great deal of weight is coming up for the last Ryder's unit thefts can easily turn into a difficult fight.
In 1997, the Danes sportsman argued in Valderamo, where Captain Seve's Ballesterso's opposition team had five points against the Americans, but the final line was only hit by the first result of 141⁄2:131/2.
“We now remember that we had great weight in Valderama; we had great weight in Brussels where we lost, and also in Valderama where we had won but only," said Mr. Bjorn (in the picture), observing the turnout in 2018 at 5:3 p.m. and at 10:6 “Le Golf National”.
Then the story will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You'll need all your strength in the morning.
Go and do everything right.
There are no points in the table until the game is over.
We have a goal: to achieve this prize, then we must seek it in a consistent manner.
I've always said that I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know exactly what stands for the other – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the sight of his players in a complex space, Mr. Bjorna added: “In no way would I want to run away from my eyes.
There'll be a different hair in the morning.
Tomorrow's gonna be the most important individual game – it's everything else.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's fine, but when you're clear, trying your ability to play golf limits.
This item needs to be installed for players – tomorrow you will have to print everything out of your own.
Now you're gonna have to get rid of the partner, and he'll have to print everything out."
In contrast with Mr. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furykas believes that his players will be better individual than partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
The storm itself has experienced both the most incredible parts of the last day, because Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe did not perform the Madina's miracle and did not become their losers."
“I remember every word that has been changed,” he replied, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 to motivate his players in preparing for the last days.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but find a quick start – what you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
Once a single step is created, the average mass becomes very weak.
We formed our team and released the players in a way that you know... we're trying to create some magic in the morning."
Mr. Thomas will be tasked with trying to fight the responsible fight and meeting with Rory McIllroy's top match, and among the Europeans are Paul Casey, Justin Rose's, Jona Rahmas, Tommy Fleetwoods and Ianas Poulters.
"I have chosen these men in this order, because I think they will successfully win the whole game," said Mr. Bjorna about their choice of units.
A new German military ship's delivery re-examined
The latest German military fleet had to start its work in 2014 and replace the wartime warships, but on the basis of local pressure, it will not be seen at least until next year because of all the alarming systems and very high prices.
According to the military representative quoted in the Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-Viurtemberg class frigate ship, the opening is now postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the military ship in 2014, but the existence of this ambitious project was hampered by the problems that had already been presented by the ship.
Four Baden-Viurtemberg Class vessels, whose military ship was ordered by 2007 to replace the Bremen Class Fregat.
It is believed that they will be equipped with powerful conditions, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment rockets and certain secret technologies, such as reduced noise, infrared radiation and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer surveillance periods, which allow the latest frigate to swim away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, military ships of the most advanced technologies of the long-term delay, which are said to be allowed by Germany to withdraw military power into the overseas territory, should take place before they begin to use them.
The failed F125 frigate was overtitled when the German military ship officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the building of the ‘Blohm & Voss’ ship in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns a ship already supplied to the builder.
The reason for the return is known little, but Germany is under pressure from a number of essential programme and technical equipment defects, for which the ship would never have been on a military mission.
It is important for the lack of software, as the Baden-Viurtemberg class ships will run about 120 seamen’s skills, which will be overpowered in the Brämen class frigates.
In addition, it has become clear that this ship is extremely difficult – this reduces its effectiveness and limits the possibility of the military fleet to implement various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of Rhineland-Pfalz are twice as difficult as similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – including the training of fast-paced technical equipment and the training of skills – also becomes a minor problem.
It is claimed that it has increased from EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The most recent problem of conflict has become very important after the last warning that the German military fleet is losing its power.
Earlier this year, Mr Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, acknowledged that the military ship is indeed "missing the proper use of ships".
The author said that problems had arisen for some time because the old ships had already been registered, but there was no change in them.
He complained that not one of Baden-Viurtemberg's crew was able to join the military ship.
"National Trust" is listening to a secret life of life of life-threatening currents.
A new study conducted by one Scottish Highway is aimed at revealing how wet grasses are used in a landscaped forest.
It is expected that the radar will provide new knowledge about the unique behaviour of flying wheels and will provide specific guidelines for future natural growth activities.
National Trust for Scotland researchers will monitor the hot spots, sopranos, red oysters and the wateriest Western Rose Invervo gardens in their research.
In certain areas, special subscribers will be placed to follow the current activity throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations by hand detectors.
An analysis of all sound records carried out by experts will determine the frequency of sound signals published by the experts and the activity of one or more types of sound.
A map and report of the living areas will then be drawn up to form a detailed picture of the behaviour of the entire landscape.
Robert Dewara, National Trust for Scotland (NTS), Natural Development Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas are most important for current stocks and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of living area surveillance, such as the creation of bees, and to understand how best to monitor forest areas in order to be suitable for current and other related species.
In the last century, the present - day population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has grown.
They are threatened by the work of construction and the development of real estate, which affects the transitions and the destruction of residential areas.
It also poses a threat to wind energy and noise, as well as to flies, some chemicals used for the treatment of building materials, as well as forested domestic cats.
There's really no eyelashes.
However, finding a grave in the night’s forest is more helpful than seeing.
The seat of the flagships in the flagship or flight route shall be clearly determined by means of an in-house echolocation.
NTS, responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important courts and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very responsible for looking at current stocks.
This is the work of ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, check events and sometimes rescue operations .
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve for special current stocks in Scotland in the Thrave dwala in Dhamfrey and Gallow, where eight of the ten Scottish species live.
David Thompson, the port overseer, says that the port area is ideal for them.
“We have a great place in the threave yard for the current stores,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of forest trees and beautiful areas to live.
But we don't know much about current stocks yet, so work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need in order to thrive."
It stresses that it is very important to check whether there are no current savings before the start of the territory's surveillance work, since it is not possible to kill up to 400 refugees and young people, which can result in the destruction of all the local population.
They are protected and prohibited from being arrested, tortured or tortured and also prohibited from destroying their possessions.
The Scottish Anti-Fraud Fund official Elisabeth Ferrell invited the public to contribute to the rescue of the Firearms.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our currents, and we don't know how many local populations are following."
Mr Ronaldo refused the charges of expropriation, and the lawyers intended to present a German newspaper to the court
Christian Ronaldo called him "melangues" and said that people, using his name, "are trying to hear".
His lawyers prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges to be brought before the court.
The opposition party of the Portuguese and the Youth Club is accused of being detained by American Kathryn Mayorg in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he had reportedly paid 375 000 dollars to women in order to prolong the event.
Speaking of 142 million followers living in Instagram after several hours of reporting the charges, 33-year-old C. Ronaldo criticized reports and called them "melagians".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – melaguenes – spoke five times with the "Ballon d'Or" laureate looking at the camera.
- They want to scream on my name.
Or normal.
They want to be heard and hold my name as part of my work.
I'm a happy man, everything's fine," added the sportsman.
According to Reuters, Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to refer Deer Spiegel to the court on charges they called "unacceptable interference with the publication of private space matters."
Justice Christian Schertzas said that the sportsman will be compensated for "the moral damage that amounts to the significance of this violation – well, one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevados Clarke District Court, after the night of the meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sports room where he was alleged to have avoided it in an analytical manner.
Mr. Mayorg said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo had been on the street and told her that he was "99% good" who had issued the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that he had sexual relations but claimed that they had been contractually.
Mr. Mayorga also said that she had called the police and her injuries in the hospital had been photographed, but later she agreed not to agree in court because "the actions of the responsible person" and did not worry about "publicly reduced."
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels the alleged injury.
At the time of the attempted bombing, Ronaldo was born from Manchester United to the real club in Madrid, and this summer, after signing a 100 million-euro contract, joined the Italian giant Juventus.
"Brexitas" The United Kingdom would have lost manufacturers of cars forever
According to the Secretary of Business, Grego Clarko, the United Kingdom would “remain forever” if after Brexito the world leader of car production had lost his world status.
It added, without any concern at the fact that the Toyota division in the United Kingdom's BBC declaration that, after Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement, production in the Burnaston factory would have been temporarily stopped near Derbio.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarkas.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the crossing of the border to Brexit would have taken place without the loss of a meaningful place of employment.
Burnaston, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, has been manufactured over the past 150 000 cars, 90 % of which are exported to another European Union country.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop its production," said Director General Burnastone Marvinas Cookeas.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about the withdrawal from the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after the month of Brexit, he will close his mine.
According to car manufacturers, there is no risk of providing Brexit without contract.
The Toyota production line shall operate where necessary, as details of the vehicles produced under the order are carried out by both the UK and the EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the EU will remain without a contract on 29 March, there may be barriers to the border; according to this industry, details may therefore be delayed or missing.
Toyota said that there would be no more than one day reserve in Derbišyro's factory, so the production would cease.
According to Clark, future relations with the EU under the Plan Theres May "Checkers" are "prepared essentially to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would not only allow us to enjoy success today but also take advantage of this prognosis," he said to BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
‘Not only Toyota, but also other car manufacturers’ data show that it is necessary to continue to use a very successful supply chain system.’
‘Toyota’ could not state which production would have been stopped for a while, but was aware that, in view of the long-term perspective, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
A 24-year-old worker at Burnaston's factory and in her office for the Union's professional union meetings, Peter Tsouvallars said that members of his trade union are increasingly concerned: "From experience I say that these jobs are lost, they will never come back."
The representative of the government said: "We have proposed goals and confidence for future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, Trumpo meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed
"In the course of the fight against a candidate to the Supreme Court judge, a very important meeting of Donaldo Trumpo with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be held next week," the Baltiary Chamber reported on the following Sunday.
Rosenstein, Special Adviser Robert Mueller's work – the last one to examine Russia's movement to elections, the association of Trumpo supporters with Russia and the possible ban on the exercise of the President's right.
The question is whether Trupas has dismissed the deputy of the Attorney-General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk for many months in Washington.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed taking a microphone to talk with Trump and taking over the opportunity to remove the president's 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not accept this report.
However, when he died of rehabilitation reports, he went to the White House the other day.
It was announced that the meeting with Trumpa, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The troops said they did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later the meeting was canceled so that they would not comply with the meeting of the Senate Court Committee in which the witness and Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford were one of the women who had been sexually abused.
On Friday, Trumpas FTB launched a weekly investigation into the charges made by Kavanaugh, and again voting at the plenary session of the Senate.
The print representative Sarah Sanders showed on Sunday on Fox's news show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “His date is not set; it can be held this week, but in view of all events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for a week.
But we'll see. I always like to print news."
Some journalists would disagree with this claim: since September 10, Sanders has not attended any White Room Press Conference.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conference rarely takes place because he doesn't like TV journalists looking for "effects to watch." In fact, he added, "I must agree with the fact that they're looking for effects."
Then I realized that the trumpet was more often with the press than it was with the general press.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous President," she said and, without giving any evidence, added, "We have looked at this statistics."
According to Sanders, the press conference will be held, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and have seen it happen many times over the past few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct contact with the President of the United States."
The House has always responded to questions from the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The President's presentation to journalists this week in New York must have been free and sometimes changed.
The Ministry of Health of Scotland has written EU employees about Brexit threats
The Ministry of Health of Scotland wrote a letter to the EU's NST employees expressing their gratitude and wanting them to remain behind "Brexit".
The member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the fall of the UN.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of permanent residence applications for EU citizens employed in the public service sector.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: “The UN and the EU negotiations on termination continue this morning and are approaching the expected decisions.
But the UK Government has taken action to prepare a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're not very happy now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I value the contribution of all workers, which does not matter what their population is.
Our colleagues from all over the EU and others will draw on valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care system are beneficial for our patients and communities.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
An emergency operation performed by Christion Abercrombie after a head injury
Saturday through the result 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores team lost their head injuries to the Tennesse State Tigers, a quick operation against Christion Abercrombie was carried out, reported journalist Mikeâs Organas.
"Tennessee State" coach Rodas Reeds told reporters that the trauma occurred before the end.
"They came to the side line and just jumped there," Reeds said.
The trainers and doctors at Abercrombie’s side gave the fires to breathe, then sat down on the stoves and sent out further studies.
"Tennessee State" official Chris Harris from Nešvili (Tennis) WSMV said Abercrombie surgery at Vanderbilto Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type and extent of injury", and Tennessee State tried to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie was transferred from Ilinajas and the Tennessee State team to play the first season during the official sports season.
Before leaving the castles, he returned five coins on the sixth day, and the total number of return coins per season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay a more significant tax
Under new roof plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay more significant tax and additional money will be used to assist the foreign buyers
This step will reduce the risks posed by the Corbyno campaign to attract young voters
Taxable persons who do not pay US taxes will be taxed with a significant tax
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to collect up to 120 million weighted steriles per year and to help the disabled
Today Theresa May will declare that foreign buyers who buy real estate in the UK are expected to tax a higher rate with a significant tax, and that they will receive additional money to help them use their precious property
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to large-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risks posed by Jeremy Corbyno's campaign to attract young voters.
A significant increase in tax will be taxed by non-taxable persons and companies in the United States, and additional money will be allocated to promote the Government's campaign against unemployment.
The additional market — paid alongside the current labelling tax, including the second-party rental of other houses or houses that were imported two years ago — may reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to bring together up to 120 million weighted steriles per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-US citizens, which makes it more difficult for buyers to do so at prices and in the first apartment.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich countries and especially in capital areas became city actors.
The new strategy was presented only a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson invited him to reduce the tax rate and thus help more young people to acquire the first houses.
He persuaded large construction companies to buy the land quickly, but without using it, they supported large real estate prices, and urged May to solve the debt of the British Great Care House by rejecting purchased housing allowances.
Corbyna has published some of the proposed housing reforms, including rental price control and the ban on loading without charge.
He also wants more power to build new houses for municipal councils.
May said: “In the past year, I said that I would be looking forward to returning to the British dream, and every new life must be better.
And this means that we need to resolve our damaged housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that non-USs and foreign companies can also buy houses as easily as British residents work hard.
Most people's dream of having an apartment has become almost impossible, and the threat of unemployment is still too real."
Jack Rosss: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish election"
"Sunderland" leader Jack Rossas says his final goal is to ever become the Scottish electoral leader.
At 42 years of age, a 42-year-old Scotch enjoys the challenge of recovering the North-East Club, currently located at the third level and three points remaining from the first place.
After moving back to the Scottish Championship last season, St. Mirren moved this summer to the Stadium of Light.
“As a player, I wanted to play outside my country.
I went to the B collection and it all ended," said Rossas to the BBC program "Scotland's Sports Sound".
“But as a child, I grew up in Hamden’s stadium with my father in view of many Scotland’s election events, and this has always intrigued me to return.
True, this prognosis will only apply if I lead the club successfully."
They led Dickas Advocatas, David Moyes, Samas Allardiceʼas, Martinas O'Neillas, Royãus Keaneʼas, Gusas Poyatas and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers, former "Alloa Athletic" leader said that he felt uncomfortable starting to work after such well-known leaders at such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed according to the answer to the question "Can I return this club to Premier level?"
According to the structure and conditions of this club, the Premier League is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League, which he spoke.
"It's not easy to take him away, but I'm probably just going back to the club to the level that I think I've worked here successfully."
Rosso's career lasts only three years. He worked as a director at the Dumbarton Club and changed the Hearts trainers 15 months ago.
Later he helped to get back to the third division of "Alloa" and St. Mirren, who threatened to break up, turned the season into the winner of the championship.
Rosssa says that he is now more satisfied than ever that you felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This change may have been radical," he recalls about the leadership of "Alloa".
“I sincerely believed that it was right for me to lead – it was more appropriate than to play.
It's a big change because you've been following me, I've worked a lot and I've enjoyed the most satisfying luck.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many problems that need to be overcome every week.
And now it's not easy: work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. As you grow up, you always feel like you are in your prayers, but leadership gives you the greatest satisfaction."

The study found that the best year in the winter is Saturday, 17.30 p.m.
The rise in summer’s anger has increased the income of poor British clothing, but it has also increased the pressure experienced by restaurants’ networks.
The figures revealed that sales of fats and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but the income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martina, a business consultancy firm, said: “An endless sunlight and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship has shown that the season continued with similar trends as in June when the oil revenue increased by 2.8 percent.
The sale of vegetables in restaurants has decreased by 1.8 per cent, and the situation has become even worse.
The main income from the fruit and vegetables obtained from trade was undoubtedly the best, and trade in them grew stronger, rather than reduced in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sun was affected and the main income from the food from the market was obtained.
Looks like people just wanted to walk away.
The sale of food in well-manufactured vegetables and bars this month increased by 6.6 per cent and food sales by 3 per cent."
Paul Newmanas from the analysis of the leisure and reproductive sector, RSM, says: “These results continue to be visible from the end of April.
With regard to food establishments, the main factors remain the effects of air and major social and sports events.
The fact that 4.8 per cent of sales in one year will be particularly painful is that it will contribute to the constant cost-related pressure.
Most of the income from the food business companies in the summer could not be expected to be worse in the future. The time will show whether a lighter August will provide the necessary climate."
The overall growth in sales in whites and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7% and reflected the slowdown in the development of networks belonging to the brands of goods.

One out of five children has a social media appointment from their parents
The study revealed that one of five children, some only 11 years of age, has social media services that are hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 secondary schools revealed that many of the “Insta” pages are embedded
The news reinforced the fear of advertising sexual content
Twenty percent of teachers said that they had a primary assignment for their parents
One of five children, some only 11 years of age, is a secret social media assignment and hides it from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary schools revealed that there is a rapid increase in the number of “Insta” pages — a reference to the Instagram website.
The news reinforced the fear of advertising sexual content
Twenty percent claim that they use a centrally focused primary assignment for parents, but they also have secret assignments.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret third-year-old girl’s website, found out that the young woman was willing to propose: “Get out of my way.”
A study carried out by the Digital Avareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-old scientists had two assignments and half of such scientists recognized their appointment as secretaries.
MDK leader Mikeās Buchananas said: "The fact that so many young people are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is a source of anxiety."
Eliidha Doyle will vote for athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the board of directors of the Scottish Sport Council, Elidha Doyle was elected by its Director.
Doyle is the most gifted volunteer of Scotland and President. Ianas Beattie described this step as a great opportunity that allows sports leaders to take advantage of various international experience it has acquired over the past decade.
"Eilidha has gained great respect throughout the Scotland, the United States and the world sports community, and we are sure that its involvement in the Scottish sport council will bring many benefits," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as a sportsman's vote and I hope that I will really help and help lead the sport in Scotland."
A total of 200 and 400 yards [200 and 400 m] in the Atlantic Games in 1996 and from all four Olympic gold medals, now shown as a permanent BBC expert, could not run after an experienced short-term sample.
"Twitter," he wrote, "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't swim.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would be affected and how much.
I had to work until I left, but I was completely healthy, and I was able to walk again, and today I am doing the exercise of mobility!
Thank you for knowing what's going on!"
The advertising of breast-feeding, in which mothers are compared with dogs, received different reviews on the Internet
The company producing breast milk obtained different opinions about its advertising, which compares breast feeding to breast milk.
In order to mark the product described as the world's first deep breast-feeding beginning, Elvie has released an inspired commercial from the Iranian music video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom that food gives mothers new drinks.
In this full-fledged neighborhood, four real mothers are shocked by the sound record in which they hear, for example, the words, "Yes, I pray myself, but I don't see any shadows" and "If you didn't notice, here's no stress, here's my heart."
The prophecy goes on to say, "I will take it. I will take it out. I will eat it. I will bring it out. I will take it out. I will pray for it."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page led to an online debate.
In the 77,000 times reviewed and several hundred comments received from viewers, many said that it was viewed by the fingers as part of the milk industry's crop.
‘The decision to place carts for advertising for this product is very empty.
Like us, they have to build and grow to produce milk, only after they're newly grown after a few days' time," wrote one woman.
‘Elvie’ breast milk not visible in the feeding room (’Elvie’ / ‘Mother’)
Another commented: “It’s amazing that it affects both mother and baby.
But why didn't they use advertisements for breast milk for mothers whose babies aren't born?"
Another added: "The advertising is completely incomprehensible."
Another commenter's release was the defense of one woman who admitted that her song was "very serious".
“I thought the idea was genius.
I'd buy it if I was still eating.
When you stop milk, I feel like a bear.
It's a little unintelligent, but I took it as what it is.
This product is genius," wrote one.
Another commented: “This heavy advertising is for mothers who cut off their milk (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
Their purpose is not to stop or harm the milk industry."
At the end of the video entry, the group of women reveals that they are all shocked by the undetectable cuts made in the blades.
The campaign’s idea is based on the view that many milk from breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie does not cause any noise, no pipes or pipes and no noticeable room in the dining room – so women can move freely, keep their babies or even leave home.
‘Mother’ partner and Executive Director Ana Balarin commented: ‘Elvie’ is a revolutionary product which has led to the start of its trade in which it has been made attractive and attractive.
In comparison with the milk cows, we wanted to focus on milking and all the challenges it faced, as well as to show the incredible sense of freedom that will bring new refreshments.
Elvie was the first to appear on the press title.
During the week of London's fashion designer Martos Jacubowski's collection of two children's mothers demonstrated on the floor using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved slowly to a warehouse near the border of Texas
The number of people living on the border during the month has not significantly changed, but the number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies of the administration of Trumpo made it more difficult for them to live with the refugees.
The traditional majority of refugees themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that they would be at risk of staying in the country by calling for a child’s birth.
The Federal Government will announce to the Republic of Georgia that possible asylum seekers and other adult members of their families will have to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities, the risk has increased.
Last week, the chief officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albenceʼas, testified to the Congress that the institution had maintained several ten persons who had applied for the world of minor minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
“ Nearly 80 per cent of these people — refugees or their family members — live in a country that is illegal and most of them are foreign criminals.
That is why these people will continue to be persecuted," said Albenceʼa.
According to staff in custody, in order to speed up the discussion of children’s cases, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children in court must be shown within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as usual.
Many of the requests for legal status before a judge on immigration issues will be tried not to arrive personally but to attend a conference video call.
Those who do not have the right to aid will be deported quickly.
According to the reports received from staff and in recent months from the system, as long as children remain in custody, it is more likely that they will become unhappy or depressed, which may lead to forced probation or attempts to escape.
The experts say that this is even more alarming in large institutions, such as the Tower of London: because of their size, they are more likely to not notice signs that the child is worried.
They added that moving children to a nursing home without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or to deal with friends can increase many of the problems they have already experienced.
Syria, France and Turkey were forced to stop immediately
In addition, when calling on the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walidas al-Mouelemas invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country had already taken place for eight years.
Moulelem, acting as Vice-President of the Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces that were involved in the fight against terrorism in Syria were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
"It must cease immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moulelem stated that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, millions had to leave their homes, the war with terrorism almost ended.
He said that Damascus would not be able to fight this holy war until all Syrian territories were destroyed by terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners.
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria who are mostly training and consulting Kurd's forces and the Syrian Arab disarming Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 wounded soldiers in the affected country.
Speaking of the refugee problem, Moulemas said that the conditions were good for them to return. At the same time, some Western countries felt that they were spreading undue fear of returning refugees.
"We have moved to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them come back," he said.
"He is policyging what should be a clear humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria's recovery aid would come only when Assadas and the opposition reached a political agreement and ended the war.
The UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last major power plant Idlibe created conditions for rapid political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement allowed Russia to avoid a massive share of Syria's assets, focusing on a province where three million people live.
However, Moulemas stressed that the terms set out in the agreement were clear and hoped that military action would be directed towards the Jihadists, including combatants from the “Al-Qaeda” front, which would be destroyed.
The UN will send Staffanas de Mistura to hold the first meetings of the Committee established by the Government and the opposition members to prepare a draft Syrian military constitution and prepare for elections.
The Commission has set out conditions under which the work of the group must be limited to the review of the current constitution and has been warned not to fail.
Why will Trump be selected for the second term?
On the basis of such logic, in 2020, Trump would have been elected, unless he had expected many liberal views, his presidency would have ended earlier and scandals.
Without a doubt, this would have been the most dramatic time of the presidency!

From 2014 the best transmission time rate in CNN has increased more than twice in CNN than 1.05 million, while MSNBC is almost three times as high as 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best-time broadcasts, with an increase of 1.7 million years ago and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show takes the first place on cable television ratings with even 3.5 million main news evenings.

Of course, contrary to the other TV shows, the problems that arise in Washington can resolve the Roe case against Wade's future, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the world economy.
Dissemination is a snare which can only be allowed to the most privileged viewers.
However, it is more than necessary to be informed by a citizen when you realize that a group of experts has been discussing how Bobas Woodwards uses unpublished data, Paul Manafortas demonstrates a $15,000 price-added skin strip (the "surprising finish", wrote The Washington Post) and what it means to create a definition of Stormy Daniel's Trumpo anatomia.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario either.
“His actions remind you of the reality show, because he tells you something every evening,” says Mr. Brentas Montgomery, director general of Wellhouse Entertainment and author of the "Pown Stars" of the changing Trumpo show.

When I met Fless this week, at his home on the north coast of Kawi was 27 degrees hot and light sun, but he was inside the tunnel and, according to CNN, looked at MSNBC.
He was unable to recover – indeed not when Britain had to stand before the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court fell on its hair.
"I remember when we used to create these inconsistency shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleissa said.

Money from the environment comes into force in the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
Nothing changes the fact that, as a result of the reorganization of the Congressary Circles which ended with the trial of the two Members of the House of Representatives, the 17th Round of Pennsylvania was spent on money.
A recent revised measure of Pittsbergo's review included a democratic member of the Romes Cororá Lamba – the past summer of his place during the special elections he won in another round.
Lambas competes with another member of the Roma – the Republic of Keithu Rothfus, who is now represented by the 12-year-old Pansilvania. Much of it is overrun by the new 17th.
The maps are to be deleted when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided on dryness that, in violation of the Constitution, the benefits of the former constitution had been falsified by the republics.
During the elections in the new 17th round, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DRC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRC) – took care of the funding of the campaign.
Lambas in Pennsylvania was shocked when, in the 18th Congressroom, there was a small surplus of votes in the event of a wide-ranging special elections in March.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by the republics, and President Donalda Trumpas won 20 points in the circuit.
The political know-how has given the democracies this advantage.
The United States considered Salvador to be punished for its support to China, but then the settlement
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but in fact they did not have the negative reactions of Washington.
In June 2017, Trumpas attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a guest in this country before the partners were sent to the Trump Organization.
"The officials of the state of Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have recently decided to withdraw from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama the heads of the American diplomatic missions," said Heather Nauert in a report published earlier this month.
However, the sanctions are considered only for Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions covering the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions on specific persons would have been painful for Central American countries with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic pressure.
But in mid-September, the highest administrative officer clearly indicated his wish that the conference would be held, and that was essentially the end of any consideration of the sanctions against Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of the administration for this meeting, Vice-President Mikeʼas Penceʼas has now been included in the list of speakers for the conference scheduled for mid-October," the diplomats said.
And three Americans are returning to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any arrests or punishments in Washington.
The White House representative refused to comment to Bolton on a small discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, had agreed to discuss in-house discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their statements shall be approved by the Administration for the close removal of the analysis, as well as by the speaker if its anonymity is preserved.
Lessons for Us:
The report of the Special Adviser, Robert Mueller, on the possible prohibition of Trumpo's legality, is still inevitable – its very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, it is said that Muelleris is calling for his investigation to question whether the Trumpo campaign has not been carried out secretly in cooperation with our elections by Russia.
If Congress were to take responsibility in this institution, it would be at the same time as it is ready to stand before the voters again and perhaps eventually before the Board of Governors.
This is very much "if" here and I do not say that the end of Trumpo is inevitable – like its conformity in Europe.
We will have to choose between the two sides of the Atlantic, and these options will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to translate Hitler into a position to oppose him in the West and support the Czechs in Munich.
We stopped and missed the opportunity to prevent a few years later from going on for shortcomings.
History revolves around such important points of reference, which will then be without prejudice to the basis or scope of democracy.
Now the Americans are at a number of such important points.
What will we do if Trupas, the deputy prosecutor General Roda Rosenstein, is responsible for the remains of Mueller's investigation?
The disturbances of Rosenstein began when this paper reported that last year the officer proposed to register the president and discussed his inability to carry out these duties.
Rosenstein says the statement "The Times" is not true.
‘How will we react if the new FTB investigation by Bretto Kavanaugh proves to be incorrect or unfair or if this candidate will be assigned to the Supreme Court without any evidence of any evidence of sexual harassment and abuse?
And finally, will we vote in the mid-citizen elections for Congress, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we don't keep these tests, democracy will be cold for a long time.
But because of the lessons I have learned in Prague, I hope we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew to Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to the Osvenccy by the same regime of nations, where I lived as Ambassadors.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years I was sent to burn the tongue fish on a table with swastika.
When do I have such a leftover, how can I look beyond the future?"

Graham Dorrances from Rangers' encounter with Rapid Onena is waiting optimistically
The fourth day of the Rangers Rapid Vienna will be accepted by knowing that if the attacks in Spain earlier this month with Villallreal were to be won before the east, they could be held in a strong position allowing the G group to remain.
The middle player Graham Dorrances was able to show this season for the first time only 2:2 results in finished matches with "Villareal". But he hopes that the Rangers club can use this result as a trampling line for more important goals.
"We had this result because "Villareal" is a great team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the hope that we would achieve something, and we ended up doing it.
We may have been more upright in the end, but generally there was no harm in the harvest.
They must have played the first bell better, and we were late in the second and showed who we are better team.
On Thursday there will be another important evening at European level.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult because their results have been great in recent rounds, but I am sure that with the support of the viewers we can move forward and achieve good results.
Over the years it has been really difficult – and what has happened to my injuries, and changes in the club itself, but now there are two good results.
The team is good and the kids are really happy; the training is great.
I hope we can move forward now, forget the past season and successfully play."
Women are worried about the fear of pensions
Although the audience was clearly impressed by the concern that they should have, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the respondents to the NATIONWide survey said they had talked to spouses about the long-term maintenance price.
Only 10 percent said you talked to the children about it.
"People want to take care of them as a family member, but they don't try to talk about it," said Vice-President Holly Snyder of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's what you need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not report your wishes before, your family will not be ready to take care of you.
Discuss with the consultant and the family where you would like to receive any care, as these factors may be important in order to provide for the costs.
Contact the financial adviser. The consultant can also help you figure out how to pay these expenses.
Long-term supervision can be decided to pay these costs by means of a traditional long-term supervision insurance certificate, a mixed monetary life insurance certificate or by defending your property until you have money.
Select legal documents. Watch allow documents to prevent legal disputes.
Choose authorisation for health care. Assign trust to people who will care for your medical care and ensure that specialists will change your wishes if you can't communicate.
In addition, think of the mandate to care for your finances.
You should choose the trust of people who would make financial decisions for you and ensure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.
Do not forget minors. Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and takes him or her to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be ready, write these little ones down in the plan.

Inflammation with pneumatic shots several times overman
After spending the night in the city, the man who had come home had several times been shot at by a pneumatic gun.
In the 40th century, Ilfracukum Oxford Grauvo, Devone, was attacked by an earthquake, a hurricane, and an earthquake.
About 02.30 p.m., an attack by officials during the summer of England was described as an incident.
The victim didn't see it.
The damage does not endanger his life, and the police seek the help of witnesses.
Land degradation and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 died on the fifth day of the city of Palu, Indonesia, when powerful earthquakes and tsunamis took place," said officials.
As a result of the destruction of the communications services, no data could be obtained from the Dongal regency – to the north of Palu’s coastal area, located near the 7.5-ball earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal in the island of Slava.
In 2017, about 379,800 inhabitants of Palu are the capital of the province of Sulaši, located on the western coast of Sulaša Island.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regenitivity which has reached its beginnings more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the island of Sulawesi in the north.
In Regentity – for the province in the smaller administrative region – there are about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic frameworks of the Central Sulawesi Province, in particular in the eastern region of Dongalos.
In the province there is also the importance of Nickel’s punishment, which is, in fact, most of which is concentrated in the other side of the Slavonic coast of Morovaly.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times over the past century from tsunamis.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by the tsunamis in Dongalo and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In addition, during the evening, Dongala fell asleep in 1996 and killed nine people.
On a symmetrical basis, the fires of the Pacific Ocean continue to cause earthquakes in Indonesia.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake in the western coast of the province of Acheho of Indonesia caused a tsunami in northern Sumatra, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Achehe.
At the end of March and early April 2005, a number of strong movements created the evening Summer Coast.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias.
In 2006, 6.8 balsam forced the southernmost densest part of the Indonesian island of Java and caused the tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, 7.6 ball strength movement created a site near the capital of the province of Sumatros in Padango.
He killed more than 1,100 people.
In 2010, a 7.5-inch wave surge created one of the Isle of Mentavajas near Sumatra and caused the tsunami with a flood of up to 10 metres, which swept ten villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, because of the lack of stability in the Achehe earthquake, the regenitivity of Pidiaja Jaja, which existed in the area of the Achehe earthquake, was undermining and panicking because the people’s reminder of how it was delayed after the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This massive tsunami did not kill more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong movements created the most popular island of Indonesian tourists in Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake struck thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped in the coast.
The son of chief Sarah Palin was arrested for family violence
In response to the charges, Track Palinas, the former chief governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin's son, was arrested.
The report published on Saturday states that 29-year-old Palinas from Vasilia (Aliaska) was arrested on charges of family violence by the police to prevent the notification of family violence and the suspension of resistance.
As stated in the police report, when it was known that he tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he turned off his phone.
As KTUU reported, Palina was returned to the judicial detention institution of Mat-Su for heart arrest and left for US$500.
"On Saturday he presented himself to the court where he said he was totally innocent," reported the network.
The debt is charged with three Class A offences, which means that it may be fined and punished for up to one year.
It is also charged with class B fraud, a criminal day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time the charges against Palin have been lodged.
In December 2017 he was convicted of his father's murder of Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected explosion.
The case is currently under consideration by the Aliasko Veterans Court.
This event is linked to the fact that he was charged with house arrest in 2016, with the prevention of family violence and with the detention of arms while not being a ship.
His daughter said he was kicking her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when her son’s behavior was associated with a traumatic stress disorder caused by his ministry in Iraq.

At least 384 people died on the fifth day of the tsunami struck the island of Sulawai, Indonesia.
7.5 The earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks do not work. It is believed that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near central Slavonia, in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Social media shares video recordings that depict the face of the tsunami.
The city was struck down by the tsunami, when hundreds of people were gathered together to the Passover celebration in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors of the suspected terrorist attack in New York are seeking a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a alleged terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
It is estimated that on October 31st, the 30th century Saipov of Home Depot pulled off the truck and set off on the bikes the night before the Master of the Land of Manhattan, driving on the road, lay down the foothills and the bikers.
As stated in the report in the South District of New York on the intention of the death penalty, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov had killed eight victims and had caused serious damage to the body.
According to the Court's document, both of these charges may end the sentence of death.
A number of weeks after the assassination, the Federal High Contracting Party announced to Saipov a 22-point indictment covering eight charges relating to the use of property (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the destruction of violence and motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claim that the execution was well planned and prejudged, and as Saipov did, he was named a witch, a hero, and a moralist.
‘As a result of the actions of Sayfulllo Habibullaevius Saipov, the family members and friends of Diego Enrique Angelino, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drakeʼo, Ariel Erlio, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco were injured, injured and killed by the actions of Saipov.’
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was imposed was examined in the South Guard of New York ten years ago.
The accused Khalidas Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethele Rosenberg for married couples in New York, when they were sentenced two years ago to the death penalty for breaking up the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
The death penalty for both Rosenbergs was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not exercise his influence immediately after his death or a few months later.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he did.
On the basis of the alleged act, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by the video of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital to make a delay in the Islamic state.
He did not recognise his debts in accordance with the 22nd recital.
David Patton, one of the federal-funded defenders representing Saipovu, said they were apparently confused by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to recognise the debt and to stay until the head of life is released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all relevant persons,” said Patton.
Saipov's defence team earlier asked the prosecutors not to face the death penalty.
The Turkish Parliament says that the Brexit negotiations must be responsible for NIGELAS FARGEʼAS
Today, during a protest in the Tower Conference, Nigelas Farageʼas promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said that politics must feel the anger of the Eurosceptics, and one of the parliamentarians of the Theres May Party proposed that he should conduct negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative General's Chamber of Commons, Peter Boneʼs demonstrators at Birmingham, said that the UN would now have emerged if Farageʼa had been the secretary of Brexit.
But the difficulties faced by May in trying to combine the broken party's speed were highlighted by the remaining EU leaders who joined the city's separate protest against "Brexit".
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to carry out a compromise plan in his Czech territory when it is supported by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Unions strongly demanded that it try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and the Leiborist Party to collect its package or chaos.
Boneʼas said through the "Leave Means Leave" meeting in Solihale that he wanted to serve the Čekerso plan.
He claimed that Farageās had to be an equal partner and had to be entrusted with the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had led us, we would already have left the EU," he said.
A member of the Velingboro Parliament added: "I will fight for Brexit," but we must reject the Čekers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in the world wars, not to be obedient to others.
In our country we want to adopt our laws."
âBone’s rejection of the fact that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The view that British people have won and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
"Brexit" was also involved in demonstrations and told journalists: "I'm just saying, Minister President, listen to people.
The Czech plan will not be popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it. It will not be popular and between our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Reject the Čekers plan and start listening."
In a critical May report, she added: "The Prime Minister has kept his post when he keeps his promises."
Farageʼa said that policy-makers should be forced to feel anger if they issue a decision adopted by the referendum in 2016.
"Now this is the issue of trust between us, people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give "Brexit," so we're here today to tell them we won't let them get out of it."
He added: “I want you to force our political class, which has almost issued Brexit, to feel anger.
We mobilize the army of the people of this country that has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, the city and the UK."
And "Brexit" opponents, before they set up an ambiguity center of the city for two hours, crossed the Burmingmo streets.
After meeting this week for the group, the bourgeois activists moved to the posters "Torians against "Brexit".
Leiborist Lord Adonis himself called on the conservatory about the security problems they had experienced at the beginning of the party's program.
“These people who say they can install IT systems and all technologies are required for the option ‘Canada plus plus’, with no triangular and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
‘This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as "Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider taking part in the presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential elections after the November elections.
"Boston Globe" reported that the Masachuss democracies spoke about their future meeting with the public on Saturday evenings in Massachusetts.
Warren, who is constantly critical of President Donald Trumpa, participates in the re-elections held in November to meet with GOP's representative Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trumpo campaign Masaçesetse.
She was surprised that she could meet Trumpu in 2020.
Since Trupas became President, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke has been its 36th meeting with voters using a public meeting format.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and adjust the subversive government, and that must be guided by women.
Suspected in LSU Simso's removal case
The Russian police in Baton City of Louisiana reported on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect who was charged with arresting LSU crammer Wayde Sims on Friday.
At the 11 a.m. press conference in Baton Ružo, the Department of Police reported that it had been held for 20th-century Dytheona Simpson.
The police distributed the video on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was seen in it.
Twenty - year - old Sims was shot and died about five days before the city of South University.
According to "247sports", police chief Murphy J. Pauls reported on Saturday that Waydeʼs Sims had been shot into the head and died of injuries.
Waydeʼa stood up to fight a friend and Simpson pulled him off.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was in a crime scene, had a gun and was taken to Waydeňá Sims.
The Simpson is held unrepudiated and has been closed to the police department in the East Baton district of Russia.
198 cm before the final course, a student named Simsa grew up in Baton Ruze, where last season he played 32 games, 10 of which started at the beginning of Friday, spent an average of 17.4 minutes in the field, gained 5.6 points and recovered after 2.9 inches.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton joined the World Championship title when the team ordered him to give a victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valteris Bottas hit Lewis Hamilton on the sixth day of his qualifying trip, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes command on the plane would be very important.
From the start of the race, Bottas started well and, arguing his position on the first two expeditions, did not just stay in Hamilton's camp, encouraging Vettel to attack his teammate.
The first came to a two - story garage, left Hamilton and he went to the airport in the shadow of the return group, so it was crucial.
"Mercedes" ordered two corresponding garages after the train and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton, after contact alone, stepped forward when the Ferrari driver followed a double manoeuvre in order to save the position on the third floor, did not want to release the inner half of the track.
The 21st birthday of Max Verstappenas began at the end of the union, but by the end of the first cycle, the seventh had already taken place.
He was the fastest part of the race because he was driving without changing his gear so that as fast as he could finish, he surrounded Kim Raikkonen and finished fourth.
At the end of the 44th century, he ordered two parallel garages, but in the remaining eight years he was unable to increase time and the fourth round of the Raikkonen finish line.
"It was a hard day for Walter, because he was well followed all week, and when he was asked to forgive me, he seemed like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and got two first places out," Hamilton said.
It was a really dirty body language.
President Donaldas Trumpas, during a six-day meeting with people, quoted Senator Diane Feinstein as saying that these opponents rejected Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which a candidate to the Supreme Court is accused of sexual harassment by Brittas Kavanaugh.
In speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's statements to the Senate's legal committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are unwilling, unkind and unjust.
“What has happened and really happens in the last days of the Senate, when you see the suffering that people are suffering, unwanted, unkind and unfair,” he said.
“ When you see official statements and statements, and then you say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you out of your way?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she delete the document? “Oh, what?
Not really.
I didn't do it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we find out... no, we didn't?" he added, showing the senator.
Another letter was received by Feinstein, in which Ford’s charges were detailed to Kavanaugh and who had been dismissed earlier September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been withdrawn from his office.
According to The Hill, the Feinstein Committee said: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations and her history I did not fail."
"She asked to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
However, on Saturday evening he said: “You know, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen."
The president further challenged the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying that democratics used their claims for their own benefit.
‘They shall endeavour to restore the authority by any means necessary.
You see indistinctness, inconsistencies; they don't care what they want or what they have to move to get power and control," said the President's statement "Mediaite".
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyers at the dance with the Dandi Giants club won two prizes
Dundee Stars returned for a five-day defeat in the Italian league and won the six-day rounds in charge of Dandi's performance 5:3.
"Giants" earlier emerged when Patrick Dwyers and Francis Beauvilliers won the prize for two years.
Mikeãs Sullivanas and Jordan Cowneys were a comparative result before Dwyer re-examined the Giants.
French Bouchardas from the Danish team compared the result, but later two Lucas Lundvaldo Nielsens won the victory.
Adam Keefe’s men suffered a third defeat this season in the Elythian league, before that Friday night in Belfast and ended the Danish club result 2:1.
This was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous teams won the Giants.
Two of them entered the first entry in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer and after four more minutes, Beauviliers doubled the excess of David Rutherford's transfer.
At the hard start, Sullivan returned the family of the arena to the game by winning the prize at 13:10, and after the transfer of Matto Marquardto Cownieś compared the result to 15:16.
Dwyer was worried that Giants would leave for the first stop by the first time, and at the end of the first call, he won his second night fare.
Having a quantitative surplus, the family of the village resigpated and Bouchard re-balanced the result 27:37.
Cownieës and Charles Corcoranas joined forces to help Nielsen to pull out Dandi's command first at the end of the second call, and confirmed the victory by winning the fifth command entry in the middle of the last call.
"Giants", who have already lost four last rounds of five, will trust the Milton Keynes team next Friday at home.
The pilot died to help hundreds of passengers escape from the earthquake
The head of the Indonesian flights was released at the time of the death of several hundred passengers safely to the air.
More than 800 people were killed, and the majority were considered to be more than tenacious after the fifth day of the severe earthquake struck the island of Sulaja.
The village continued to be hit by strong repeated earthquakes, and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues escaped while saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavanas Agunas refused to leave his post on a heavily changing management bridge at the port of Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri in Palu.
He remained at his place of work in order to help a 6321 flight to Batik Air, which was at the time on the ground, safely to mount.
At that time, he was driven out of the air, feeling that flight management was a mess.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, a representative of the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Johannes Siritas said that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We flew him off the coast of Kalimantan to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we don't make it this morning, we don't get to Pula.
"We know this without any further pain," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of deaths can increase to thousands, as the country’s disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangalos, Sigio and Boutong are seriously reaching.
“It is expected that the number of victims will still grow, as many victims are still under heavy conditions and we cannot reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the agency.
Up to two feet [6 m] high, they marched out of the city of Palu; there will be a full moon on the next day.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and spare parts.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, said: “Sky News every minute of the fast cars bring the victims.
There's no clean water.
All wholesale retail sales . "
Janis Gelfandas CNN, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can worsen."
On Sunday, the Indonesian President Jokas Widodas arrived at Palu and called on the country’s military: “I have written all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evading tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one person who hit the plane is big
A flight that ended in an emergency at the border of the Roman waters of Micronesia now tells us that one man is a giant, although he previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the crashing plane.
The report Air Niugini said she didn't know about one traveling man on Saturday.
The air lines indicated that when looking for a man, they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers.
The air lines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, for example, his age or population.
The local authorities helped to save other passengers and crew when the plane was trying to land on the island of Chico.
On the fifth day the officers reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The air lines said that six passengers remained in the hospital for six days, all of which were stable.
It remains unclear why an accident occurred and what was the exact outcome of the events.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had crashed into the plane without such an explosion.
Some Witnesses have found that they have not been able to hide their plane from such an explosion.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying from very low to low.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to get out of the crash on a plane and before the accident.
He said that the pilots had panicked and cried, and he himself experienced a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy reported that in recent years their submarines have also helped to rescue people who are supposed to be driven to the coast before flying to a distance of about 30 metres.
According to aviation security network data, over the last two decades, Papua New Guinea has killed 111 people in airline accidents, but no one has been independent of Air Niugini.
Analyticals occurred at night when a woman was burned alive, following events
The prosecution presented the facts on the sixth day of the case of the repeated man who was accused of embezzled by a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlettas testified for several hours as an expert in the field of review.
He told the audience how he used mobile phone records to connect in total to the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 9-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers' death march on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlettas said he received local data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which was contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers when he said he had been with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to visit Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he had not been in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis told the truth by saying that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was mad because his truck was in Nashville."
Another surprise was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Mobile phone records show they knew each other next week.
Rowlettas said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis from his phone removed Chambers' messages, calls and address information.
"He removed her from his life," said Haleah.
The defence is expected to start setting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would be handed over to the defendants later that same day.
"The High Breed": What is a sensitive hypothesis?
A third of Hippo wants to change the negative view of this genre by publishing positive news.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hypothesis has disappeared from the causes of political know-how and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the hypos and repopulate the mental hypos.
Such actors as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently reborn in the United States such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The victim of New York City appealed to the court after he was fired from work on the news of the "resistance"
The victim of New York City appealed to the court for an exemption from work on discrimination after he received a notification from a mother claiming to be "one more black".
A few negative spotts and search were called "invasion".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was surprised to learn that the new child overseer Giselle Maurice was black when he arrived on his first working day in 2016.
‘NIEEEEEEE, ON THE ONE JUDE OF JUDAH’, wrote to her husband in a statement by Mr Plasco-Flaxman.
But she was sent not to her husband twice, but to Mr. Maurice.
On the basis of the New York Post, after understanding the indisputable experience of Plasco-Flaxman, she gave up her job and said that the former victim who was an African American had done his job badly and she was hoping to win the Philippines instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one work day and she was sent home by Uber Car.
Now Maurice has submitted a case to the court requiring compensation for an exemption and intends to contribute even after 350 USD per day for half a year and work in a client's home for which she was initially advised by someone without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things can't be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
On the other hand, when Maurice was convicted of racism, she said that it was wise to forgive Maurice from work because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had been raped.
"My wife sent her what she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not found," says Joel Plasca's husband "Post".
"Would you trust your children who were not tempted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
No one."
Plascas said that the woman had taken a baby only two months ago and was “very difficult”.
You're trying to prove it?
This is not very nice behavior," added investment banking specialist.
As far as the court is concerned, the media are reluctant to interfere with social networks, critical of their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers do not understand the language mix
“ It’s hard to feel another place reading the book for the first time before it was released, ” says Bondo’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
It was said that her father, who worked at the BBC operator before she received an inspiration to write a book about a blue bear, would not have been too far removed if his work had been dismissed and added that the 60th book release year after his father's death was happy and sick together.
Speaking about Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father was making a lot of progress.
"He was a very nice man and he didn't like to listen," she said.
"Because Paddington was so much like himself, he felt like he had a child who had something to do: grow up to him, although it's not your job.
I think he's pretty much appreciated Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruits of his imagination, he was always generous toward Paddington himself.
My daughter was missing, and I had to call her back.
Her daughter was quickly taken to Nicos Louis Pasteuro 2 hospital, where doctors could not save her life.
"Nadas kept calling and said that the situation was really bad, it is unlikely that she would survive," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nado who called to tell her that she was still alive for two minutes and I had to rehabilitate with her.
And I'll say goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to doctors who kept her heart free were slowly discontinued and removed from her body.
She died a little earlier and it was over.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it's all going to happen.
I couldn't raise, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in my head."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, now raising his dead daughter, entered the plane with other passengers who are not aware of the difficulties she needs to face.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was broken, and all the time I wore shoes.
It's hard to explain why, but I mean, I was going to the airport for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The opening of pregnant women is aimed at preventing suicides on the toilet
Two women who have not committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are on the Velso bridge with exciting news and phone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he was depressed, and he killed 18 years of age.
"I don't want a single parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
David, a 45-year-old man living in London, said that her son was very jealous of his boss, who was putting him out of prison.
“They all knew him because of his smile.
They've always said that his son-in-law is missing the room."
However, he did work before death because he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11, found his murdered brother.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm just afraid that a spinal reaction can happen."
“ So that people would know that there are people in the environment who can be contacted and talked, even if they are friends, ” wrote Mr. David.
Don't sit in the back, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, did not run away with his 15-year-old partner Mark, who had recently resigned from life after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, and never blamed anyone,” she said.
“A few days before Kalada, we noted his changed attitude.
The situation was very bad during Christmas: when the children came out of their gifts, he didn't look at them and didn't react at all."
She said that his death was a major tragedy for them, but they had to cope: “It was empty in our family.
That's what's going on in our heart.
But we all have to live and fight."

When the FTB started the study, Bretto Kavanaugh's future will turn on his hair
I think if we could actually get something he asked for – a limited duration and scope study – maybe we could bring some units," said Mr. Flake, adding on the sixth day that he was afraid that the Committee would "have" in the hard-to-reading of the parties.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and the supporters of his republics not want the FTB to begin the investigation?
Their opposition is only temporary.
Until the mid-term elections to be held on 6 November, only five weeks will remain and, if it is expected, the Republic will appear to be empty, their efforts to select people in the Supreme Court will be very weak.
George's W. Bush called the senators, trying to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, former Secretary of Staff.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, which currently has 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
I still do not understand whether Mr. Kavanaugh Senate may receive 50 votes in favour, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to withdraw his contacts and approve him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean desserts "lost" after the government arrived in Kimma
The law author of South Korea said that the number of North Korean desserts in South Korea decreased when Kim Jong-un arrived seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seugas, quoting data from the Ministry of the Association of South Korea, said that 1,127 deserts had been established last year compared with 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main factors had been hampered by North Korea's and China's border control and increased human trafficking prices.
Pchenjan has not given public comments.
For many North Korean desserts, South Korean citizenship is finally offered.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally killed.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the firmly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China spends time with illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced them back to their parents.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pchenjane with negotiations at which the nuclear-weapon ban negotiations had been closed.
This happened after the historic U.S. Presidents Donald Trumpo and Kim Jong-un met in June. In Singapore, both of them agreed to seek the Korean side to become a zone without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told the United States that their sanctions had not changed since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to face any international prejudice," said Mr. Ri, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh concludes "stirsky" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The head of the Roma minority, Nancy Pelosi, to the Supreme Court judge, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, called him "sister" and said that he was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court for his temper.
Mr Pelosi made these comments during an interview held by Ostine (Texas) at the Texas Tribune festival on Saturday.
"I just can't believe that if a woman did so, she would be said to be strict," Mr. Pelosi said his reaction to Mr. Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Committee on Judgments on Thursday.
B. Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that you had taken sexual assaults against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were still young.
In his introductory speech, when he spoke about family and secondary school, B. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unable to cry or quit.
He also fully noted the former democracies in the Committee, which he was accused of being "a gross and coordinated loss of reputation", which he did not organize for liberals, since Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
He argued that Mr Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had expressed his own view of democracy.
"I think he has discriminated against himself by his statements and by the involvement of the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
Asked whether B. Kavanaugh would be removed if his candidature had been approved and the majority of votes received by the Democrats in the Houses of Representatives, Mr Pelosi opposed.
“I will say so – if he is a member of Congress or the FTB, it is not appropriate to carry out the duties not only in the Supreme Court but also in the court in which he is currently working,” said Mr. Pelosi.
B. Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Colombian District Court of Appeal.
Mr Pelosi added that as a democratic she could be deprived of B. Kavanaugh's decisions on the Act or the ‘Roe v. Wade’ case’ because he is considered a conservative lawyer.
At the adoption meetings, B. Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be repealed.
“Now is not the time for us to say to the judge, ‘How amazing!’” said Mr. Pelosi.
End of which women should be used
This is a legal criticism, which lasts for months and even a year's heap of institutions that it cannot say without tears.
"When we wake up, we cry," after 45 years, I was told by a panel called Steine.
"I don't see this unusual thing, do you?"
She continues: “I was very helpful to one woman, the manager of a certain company, when she said that she too was busy, but she found a certain method: When she got up and took a bath, she told the man who was talking to her at the time: “You might think I’m upset because I’m a website.
I'm really fucked up."
And she just walked on.
I thought it was genius."

One of my most intense memories is of one of the first jobs in which I worked most of the time and where I had to work because of an unexplained introduction. Then I was struck by an older woman, an open manager, who was always so attached to me, and fell into a coma.
"Never let them see who you are," he said to me.
- They don't know you're in.
They think you're wrong, so you'll enjoy your success."
A member of the Democratic Party Congress of Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Harts was received by the visiting Monkey Business ship (aforism, which means a convenient time) and withdrew the candidate, Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not apply to the presidents himself.
“This was not a well-founded decision,” I was shocked to be told 30 years later.
– There were seven other candidates at that time, so there was no need for one more.
Someone called me "Sniegole with seven fingers."
After the campaign began, there was little time left for the collection of funds, so she reached an unannounced candidate until it was $2 million.
That was not the same fight.
She noted that some supporters, who made a sacrifice of $1,000 for a man, gave her only 250.
"May they think I'm getting a break?" she thought.
In speaking the language in which he announced that a formal campaign was being launched, it was so full of emotions – thanks to the people who benefited from it, a system of disassembly which was very difficult to collect funds and directly reach voters rather than representatives, and a struggle for sexism – that it was wrong.
“You will notice that I was nervous,” recalled Mr. Schroeder’s reaction to the pressure in her language.
– You would have thought I'd be supported by the Kleineex server business.
I remember thinking about what would be written in my memory.
"Did she believe?"
How the US and China trade route can be useful to Beijing
The US and China's first commercial army was created, and although we have not yet completed our beauty, experts say that long - term failure can be useful to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trumpas gave the first warning this year some of the basic products exported by China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The most serious opposition took place this week when new tariffs were introduced, affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) in value, i.e. they would essentially be taxed half of Chinese exports to the United States.
Pekinas responded to all measures the same: the most recent decision is to impose a customs duty of between five and ten per cent on US goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has been trying to fight the US tooth for teeth, and it seems that this second world market is not going to be released in the near future.
Vashington's sanctions would only be lifted if China complied with the requirements, but the US's public silence would be too costly for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that, if Pekinas is properly injured by its party, trade difficulties with the US can have a long-term positive impact on China because it will reduce the dependence of these markets on one another.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for which the economy of both countries would be affected is indeed much more dangerous than observers are aware of so far," said Abigail Grace, a member of the Institute of Sciences at the Asia New American Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in the recovery of a war-navigated country for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walidas al-Mouelemas said that conditions in the country were improving.
"In terms of progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues its efforts to restore the terrorists' retreats and restore normal conditions.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they had to be left because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions have been placed before everyday life and well-being.
According to UN figures, Syria remained around 5.5 million since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There is a need for humanitarian assistance for six million people living in the country.
Al-Mouelemas said that the Syrian regime would receive aid in favour of the recovery of the country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries based on origin.
Europe has won the victory of the Ryder Tower in Paris
The European team, following the final outcome of the US team 16,5:10.5, won the Reyder Tower in 2018 at the "Le Golf National" District of Paris (France).
The United States has already lost six times in Europe since 1993 and has not won Ryder Tower in this country.
Europe restored the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorno of Denmark gathered 14.5 points enough to win the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who had been closely following during the entire tournament, started a swim from the start right into the water at the end of the 16th and 3rd in front of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player F. Molinari was exaggerated throughout the round and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament acquired the current form.
U.S. Jordan Spietha 5:4 won the most recent European team player Thorbjorn Olsen from Denmark.
The highest rating in the world, Dustin Johnson 2:1 lost the English to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last "Ryder" tournament.
The eight-year-old Ryder tournament veteran of Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in this tournament, with 25.5 career points.
“I’m rarely online, but I can’t handle it today.
It's been a long time.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy. I'm very happy to have you back.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad I was able to help," said S. Garcia after the European transition.
He gives the statue to his father John Rama, who in the game on Sundays 2:1 stole the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I am amazed at the success of Tiger Woods – I grew up watching how he plays," said 23-year-old Rahma.
Woods lost all four of his swords in France and now belongs to the 13-21-3 Ryder's career record.
This changes statistics for one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 biggest prizes and only Jack Nicklaus.
U.S. commanders have not been able to apply for the entire week to the control board except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated high-level games throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furykas, after a rehearsal, said: “I am proud of these men, they are fighting.
There was a certain time this morning when we were able to press Europeans.
We ate.
I'm taking a cupcake against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder team, and we'll move first.
I love these 12 men and I'm glad I can be their captain.
You have to break your head.
Our opponents were prophets."
The news of "Roadon’s flood" is decreasing in pain, manat and Sarasoto.
The latest report of the Florida Fisheries and Rural Nature Commission (FWC) states that the total concentration of "redwater" in the Tampos basin is decreasing.
According to FWC, more fragmented Judaism was observed in Panelas, Manachi, Sarasotos, Charlotte and Colerie’s circles – this allows for the assumption that the concentration is decreasing.
The “Redwater Poison” shall cover about 130 miles from the coast of the north of Painelas to the south of Li.
Jewish areas can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Hilsboro, but less than last week.
"Radonnas dowries" was also observed in the Passover celebration.
Last week it was reported that the concentration in the Paneelas district and the center of its border was medium, the hands of the Hillsboro border – from the bottom to the high, from the Manaji district – from the background to the high, from the Sarasototo Square and the hands of the coast – from the background to the highest, from the Charlotte district – from the background to the middle, from the Li to the border – from the background to the height of the Colerio district.
There are still reports of respiratory problems in the fields of Painelas, Manachi, Sarasotos, Li and Colerie.
There have been no reports of such breathing in northern Florida last week.
