The social card of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the arrangements for the welfare of citizens using the social card of the inhabitants of the Ivan area.
As reported by the Press Service of the Government of Russia on the Ivan area, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger travel benefits and provide a social card balance scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 FZ “O national payment system”.
At the same time, the social card of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its use are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now set, not on travel as before, but on the amount of money, with the maintenance of the winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles during the summer period - not more than 800 rubles per current month.
It is now necessary for the holders of a social card to track the number of remaining trips and the rest of the money.
The cost of a favourable travel for citizens shall be one-third of the rates applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed to the area budget.
The chart of the social card's completion remains premature - from 24 months ago to 23 months now.
There will be a number of advantages in the new way of social travel.
Thus, it is possible to carry out a detailed account of the cost of money on a social card with accuracy to copies.
In addition, there is the possibility of the return of the estimated but unexploded funds.
We also add that the exchange rate scheme with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by a citizen, and the same amount is paid back to the carrier ' s budget.
No commission will be required to make a money card.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivan region, reported that more than 33 million social-carded trips were made in the region in 2014 and nearly 25 million in 2015.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget for the benefit of citizens using the social card.
As at 1 September, there were more than 312 million rubles.
During the 911 call, a teacher was admitted to killing a friend
During a 911-vote call, almost without the expensive gun teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that there was a need for staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there is a "pesic" at home who lives, but probably upset, and said that the contact of family members who died could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was written by hand in a white letter of the book: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could all go back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who won two online courses at the University of Delta, Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to a university campus where the police consider him to be the best teacher in the history of Ethan Schmidt at his office.
The Chief of Police of the University of Delta Linn Baford reported that the university staff had learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly thereafter.
At the end of the day of the victim, there was one more: Lamb finished with him as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day after the shooting in the school, the students and teachers were forced to walk behind closed doors, the authorities were still trying to put into one picture of the motivations that prompted Lamba.
The information shared by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me they were waiting for him with patience.
The police in Gothia, where Prentiss was killed, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal activity.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for “the beautiful people ” he had crossed into his teaching life.
They both taught at the schools of social sciences and history, attended by 17 teachers, and many students attended classes.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who had a good reputation for Lambe, Brandon Bevers, reported that he was also upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the school year 2014-15 told him how he had struggled with stress.
Previously, Lamb had asked the University of Delta to give him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university rules of employment meant that the level of doctor who was so busy with Lamb would not guarantee him an automatic position as a teacher.
The president of the University of William Laforz reported that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "it was obvious that Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked behind Lamba after he escaped from the camp when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before they could arrest him, Lamb shot 38 calibers from a gun immediately at the back of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the Crown of Washington, Metel Johnson.
His car with the engine was still on its way.
It was not long ago that Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those countries.
Lamb started working at a university, which included some 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctor's degree of pedagogical science in the same year.
One of Lamb’s early friends described him as a wise, charismatic, and happy man.
Carla Hayerson told me she was 15, and Lambu was 20 when they met with common friends.
She and her friend studied in the senior classes, and he was a senior boy who had been trying to learn to play guitar for years.
In those years he was successful in women.
All the girls were quiet when he was a few," says Houston, now 40 and now living in Jackson, the garden of Brendan.
Lamb and Prentiss at the moment of the events, we see they've met for a while.
At 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a song called Laitning, who lived with them in Gotay in a kripi house on the back side of the channel.
According to the police, dogs are all right.
Former Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they were still friends, and they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's all fucked up," O'Stin said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blue.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and poetry.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online at different companies.
Mike Shaffer, Barmine and Co-Co-ordinator of entertainment programs at The Jule Room for Haiti, said he had seen Lamba and Prentiss last night on 5 September when Lamb had finished playing guitar and losing money for a few visitors.
There was no suspect.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other and looked for each other.
I mean, they were both very strict.
Schmidt, the dead teacher, was a professor of high school seminars and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Goden Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, attended the Memorial of the Fire of Light.
His wife, Shimidad Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the events during which the University Hor came to shine Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The occupations are resumed in the middle.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforz.
The crisis is over.
Today's health.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare authors Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba's call came to service 911 after Shemida's murder and that, although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called in 911, information about their marriage was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that there will not be as much staff as during the holiday season, as in the past year, while the toys and goods dealer for children ensures that they will be able to work more hours for staff and temporary staff.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and public buildings throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start meetings with the claimants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still a few months away, companies are ready to hire temporary staff to have enough status in stores and to sell, download and supply goods.
Michael J. Fox's "switness" with Princess Diana.
The film's "Back in the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was still remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie and waiting for the arrival of the royal family, I noticed that the place with me was free, and here I was raised--with me sitting Princess Diana," he said in a trailer to a soon-to-screen documentary film "Back in time".
A movie starts, and here I come to the point that I'm literally at the distance from my hands and in a fake dress from seeing Princess Willy.
"Back in time" - a documentary film on "Back in the future" - includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director of the film "Back in the Future" and the executive director of Steven Spillberg.
The film's "Back in the Future" was 30 years ago.
"For me,," says Spillberg, "it's the biggest movie ever taken."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and some film theaters in October.
UN head states that there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General, Pan Ghi Mun, in response to the Syrian military support provided by Russia, stated that for nearly five years the “military solution” conflict had not existed, and the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions.
The Head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Mun stated at the press conference in the middle that he planned a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, “have created an unsolved situation”.
Mr. Gi Mun called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in the resolution of the Iran nuclear programme and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey that show that Donald Trapp is not mistaken
Some tried to bring him up with the insults of a propagandist.
The others got away from him, I took it as a joke.
And some people need scandals.
But no effort has been made by some Republicans to overcome the high position of Donald Trampa as a result of the investigations, and this has not been achieved (peace).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trapa in two significant figures, and some began to wonder what this meant for the Magnificent Inability of the chances of obtaining nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a selection cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance to nominate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that, at the time, Rick Perry had taken his place in 2011 as a leading populace in Germany, none of which had entered one state in the nominee process.
And there are many reasons why he would be fighting in the general elections.
But external groups, such as the “Political Activity Supercomputer” Jeba Bush, and the Economic Conservative Club of Growth, recognize the undeterred force of Trapa and begin to deliver their dollars to break it.
Here are some numbers of questions that say that the magnet of mobility is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratios of sympathy for Trapa were 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had responded positively to this magnitude in the field of mobility.
By mid-July it was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent early in August.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now in favour of Donald Trumpu.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are up at the initial stages.
The question of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans there had a positive impact on Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would set up a trampo as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either "with the second", or "with the satisfaction" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "stirred" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trap (43 per cent say they would be "with a second" against 40 per cent of those who speak the same way about Trape).
The next one at the east?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "disturbed" if they like Jeb Bush's residence permit.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of Trapa to be a problem.
While Trapa is critical of its coverage and degradation, 52 per cent of voters across the country believe that there is an appropriate temperature to be the President as shown by ABC News/Washington post on Monday.
The same figure is reflected in the first collection in the country in the state of Iowa, where 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he has the same person who may be the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
The Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they hope for their badges, the Republican voters think that Trump is a fraud.
On the question of who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trap was favored, according to CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like when four out of 10 put on Jeba Bush at the end of July.
Full publication: GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, four out of 10 Republicans were selected as the most likely candidate during the previous cycle, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romani.
However, this shows that most GOP voters consider the Trapa campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to pay for the second candidate, Trap continued to be in front of all the others.
Some indications indicate that such a dispersion is likely to be in favour of Trapa and that the non-Trapa support is equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical comparison of “one to one” between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trap is almost always supported by the majority.
He runs Carli Fiorino at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jacob Bush at 19 points and, finally, Randa Paula, John Kesic and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to deal with?
Ben Carson ran a businessman at all 19 points in a hypothetical equation "one by one".
More than half of Donald Trappa's supporters say they've been thinking.
A new CBS/NYT survey held on Tuesday shows that only half of the voters who support the Trapa said they were convinced in their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never thinks.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trapa at the moment is with colleague-in-aid neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've been thinking about selecting Trapa.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with the immigration treaty.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "enforcers" in his speech opening the campaign, the issue of immigration has become the most relevant topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the experience of Trapa will turn the key voters of Latin America from the Republican party into a librending party.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans said they agreed with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, before immigration comes to general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disillusionment by the Government is creating new businesses.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson now count on support for about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as austerity.
Six out of 10 Republicans said on Monday a new ABC/Post poll said they wanted a political audience rather than a person with experience in government work.
They're also stuck in Washington.
The question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Congress, with 54 per cent being "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "in summer".
The Government will decide on the number of pension indexes in October.
The Vice-President of the RF Olga Goldec stated that the Government is now seeking options for implementing the 2016 pension index law at the actual level of inflation.
She noted that the decision should be made by 8 October at the time of the draft budget for the following year in the Government.
In addition, the cabinet discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze the Russian pension.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension savings was equivalent to 350 billion rubles.
This is about the same as the full pension index for the following year.
According to the Vice-President, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to the socially protected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair for him to pay for it.
The former media reported that there were two options for budget balance in the cabinet.
Why is it so often admired and adorned by the ages?
Tatyana Levashov, a doctor of the Ophthalmologist, replied:
Our century is a wide range that protects the eyepiece from the many small particles on which they sit.
Having forgotten the regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffery.
Simple output:
Not three eyes of sinful hands, wear c as a special soft jacket for a century;
Do not consume 1-2 times a day to clear the end of the century from those buried in them for days of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures must also be complemented by warm concentrations of open medical pathways (salphea, rosmics) that survive the harsh secret of the irony and then massize the ends of the century, which should be carried out by round-footed hand movements;
Don't use alcohol.
They dry and carry the skin and contribute to the further deterioration of the secretion of the forest iron.
Phanyan claims that Korean nuclearists have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country - the nuclear complex in Yonben - is working “in full power”.
This was reported on the website of the country ' s Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that at any time CNDR is ready to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by both quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear-weapon test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
The reassessment plans of the reactor have not been reported since.
Phanyan claims he's been able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the CNDR has not repeatedly tested the average and low distance rockets, writes polt.ru.
Girinski needed to remove from the Russian gymnasium a mention of the brothers.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Girinowski believes that the mention of the Union of Brothers should be removed from the national gym.
He made this statement at the time of the meeting of the Lord, reporting on the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and killers!
"The eye is the longest game in the world, not even sportsmen," said Girinowski.
The Member believes that it is necessary to remove all four elements containing this line:
In 2014, Girinowski stated that the current gym should be referred to as "God, the King of Food", and the Russian tricycler to replace the imperial flag, writes Polit.ru.
Assad called on all the forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Barar Assad called for all efforts to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees but that it needs to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"In this context, the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue on behalf of the consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die until blood transfusions continue and people feel completely secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we win terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Remember, about 500,000 migrants, including from Syria, have arrived in the EU this year.
The Eurocommission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that there may be thousands of combatants from the extremist group of the Islamic State.
Members of the terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city set up a holiday for the refugees.
In the last month, Germany has been a refugee leader, although recent efforts have been made to maintain border control.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it a significant number.
Since September more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bi-bi-Si Jenny Hill came to Darmstadt, where migrants were warmly welcomed.
Jeremy Corbin Debt at the session of the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debate at the session of the Prime Minister is expected to be very impatient
The new leader of the Liberian Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon take the lead in the Prime Minister's session, first with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised on the second half of the day; he said that the press and members of Parliament would soon be ready to follow.
He called for “lower theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them with colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary trial of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will take place after the appointment of their tennis cabinet and his words at the annual Trench Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Liberians to remain silent during the performance of the national service gym on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, was criticized by a number of conservative members of Parliament and was the subject of several excellent articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision did not bring to the attention of the five state gymnasiums
The press secretary, Mr. Corbina, said that he had "standing in close silence" and recognized the "Heroism of the Royal VVS in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the Tenet's office, reported to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the five national leaguers "independence" of his belief in the need to reject the monarchy.
Almost ten Thai ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin ' s team, drawing up differences in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth of the members of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader.
Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "copying" in the lobbying party after Mr. Corbin has been appointed to serve in the European Union and to limit compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union Conference that the Leiborist Party had introduced amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
Several hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party because it was opposed only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth ledger of the league with which David Cameron will meet at the "curricular cave" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the lobbyists, who promised another approach to politics, stated that he had “attached collective resources” to raise Mr. Cameron ' s questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament in the district of Aylington North said that the issues raised by the Prime Minister were a great deal of conflict, and that he was also reluctant to respond and exchange quantities, rather than promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems faced by youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Igl, Minister of Economics in the Secret Office, would replace him with the question of the Prime Minister when he would be absent - for example when Mr. Cameron was outside the border.
He also called for the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had called on the Speaker of the House of Commons of John Berkow to discuss this matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of "mortal assessment", often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first transition in 1990, the question of the Prime Minister has become a key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the House of the Community and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although criticism has claimed that this has turned into critique and requires massive reforms.

Sterling's Font Grows Up With Increase in Payroll in Britain
The interest on the background of growth was paid in Britain, while the FTSE 100 index was raised thanks to the offer of SABMiller.
From May to June, the number of bonuses grew by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been highest since 2009, and it has been seen as a transfer to an earlier time of forecasting as to the potential growth of cotton.
The Sterling Pound increased by over 1 per cent in terms of $1,5505 and by 0.84 per cent in terms of the euro, by €1,3730.
FTSE 100 increases to 6229.21 by 149%.
In general, SABMiller shares were allocated, which increased by 20% due to the offer of purchases from AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two largest beer companies in the world, gathering brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9 per cent on the basis of encouraging news from the competing group of product producers of the Richemont luxury class.
The latest sales data from Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - on the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore's shares grew by 5 per cent after the proud giant declared that it had received $2.5 billion through the transfer of shares, which had been made under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's book production group and packaging materials were leaders of the index - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sale".
JD Sports has grown since the company reported an 83 per cent increase in the amount of income tax to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can slow down expansion.
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kaugill says that increasing minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing capacity in potential consumers’ cars”.
It is unlikely, however, that such purchasing capacity will lead to a higher cost of work, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports expansion plans, he added that it could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a low-pressure action campaign against Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The opposition food supplier for the initiative undertook the IGA-retailer market share campaign in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two complete warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of the following year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote the brand IGA through marketing in leading media and social networks and on Adelaide Show activities.
The campaign is accompanied by the IGA distributors and suppliers, such as the producer of Simmo's ice cream from Dansboro, who offers a discount in IGA stores, and the owners of stores selling short-term tickets to the South Australia Football League.
It is expected that Metcash will disclose more details of its strategy of protection on 29 September - the day when this total supplier of food, drink and economic goods will conduct its annual day of investor strategies.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for nearly 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA networks in eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to be engaged in normal routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA distributors than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in the USA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will account for 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first stores, taking up the amount of cash in all the games that are available, but mainly on independent dealers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kirat believes that IGA dealers can lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and 600 million on these markets, respectively.
The loss of income and sales of food products at the high level of the permanent cost of Metcash could cost companies about 13 million dollars to pay interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey revealed that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that sales of Metcash food products will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Chief Fund Manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could be very likely to disappear during the decade.
The company Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas ' s comments.
However, it is expected that Mr. Douglas was contacted last week by a member of the Metcash Board of Directors.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010, while Metcash's income from the food business, which the company provides to about 1200 IGA distributors, fell by 43 per cent compared with 2012 due to operational delivery and pressure on sales and profitability indicators.
However, the company does not pay more than US$ 150 million per year for the comparison of different prices in Coles and Woolworths at thousands of locations per week and for the aid of IGA distributors in the refurbishment of trade areas, as well as by offering a rapid increase in the range of fresh products and a wider choice of food companies.
Director General Metcash Yen Morris says that the price comparison and refurbishment of trade areas is a trade and hopes that companies will be able to increase their net income in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli
Tanasy Cockinakis deserves starters, not criticism of his conduct.
Tanasi Cockkinakis has suffered from recent scandals around his friend Nick Kyrosa and deserves more than criticism, as President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli says.
Cockinakis, a young man in a talented duette and often called "Special Ks", was at the center of his attention because of the backward movement of Cyrus with Stan Vavirinko on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a fire-qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge had to distinguish Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona twice, while Harrison said: "The war had to be placed on the bullets of Cyrus, and I should have put on the bullets of this guy."
C The time that Cockinakis last saw a devastating rocket after a judge in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly was reportedly protecting Cockinakis.
Junosha is currently in Glasgow, meeting Sam Grotto for the right to be second after Bernard Tomica in a single-level semifinal Cuban Davis v. Britain.
"I'm seriously surviving one thing, that's what Tanasi's been involved in the conflict," said Hilly.
He really broke a rocket when he got his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first game that broke a rocket when the hopes were broken, and I know Tanasy's good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact he's been very well in enough provocation situations in the US, with Harrison and so on, and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think it's a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very hard, he's a great team, he's never had any problems with other games, he's out of court, he's intensively trained, he's in a great form, he's a highly targeted and developed young man, and I think he should be valued.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kirros because of an important match that began on Friday, thinking that "consent" was the right way for everyone, but considering that a boy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term game.
"First of all, we want the team to focus its attention on the match, not on the conflicts around [Kiroosa]," said Hilli.
And I think Nick has taken the power very quickly, that people of the kind Feder and Marrey are showing up on the public, he's making a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I need to take it out of focus for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
The migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary opened the border with Serbia to the south and stopped those who were trying to cross into the country illegally to keep the flow of migrants flowing.
Hundreds of migrants have gone across the border, and Serbia's authorities have responded very negatively.
He spent an indefinite time in the road between the checkpoints of two countries, the people who fled from armed violence in their family broke down the palaces and stood on the ground.
However, frustration has increased.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted in applause to the Hungarian police for a special appointment.
Some in protest refused food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the "impossible" expulsion of migrants from Hungary when they are increasingly from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the solution to the problem rather than a cause for harm.
We need to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the near future," said Ivica Dachic in Prague.
Releases to the Hungarian-Serbian border began the following day after a blockade from 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to hold a total of 40,000 asylum-seekers in Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year), an agreement would be reached by another 120,000 refugees from Hungary by Member States of the EU.
Germany's Chancellor Angel Merkel and Austria needed to gather the EU's external summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis covered by the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for rapid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave more authority to the authorities to act against the crisis, allowing them to open their way and speed up judicial cases of asylum.
At the time, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Sierto, said that his country was also planning to remove a bridge from the border with Romania in order to cross the flow of migrants across the country, now that it ended up on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners had been involved in the immediate work to complete the siege of the railway between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the main “low place” and the crossing point of the EU border for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban of the country insists that most of those who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of military actions that have the right to protect, and this view is rarely expressed by other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at night are now considered to be a violation or damage of a 4-metre (13 foot) fence from a railway fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison periods for persons accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency," said the representative of the Government of Sultan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament must still authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press report on the border has been monitoring the presence of soldiers in front of vehicles and dogs.
Derde Bakondi, national security adviser to Orbana, reported that 45 persons who tried to cross the border had been arrested by the competent authorities at the same border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the prison, were currently under police detention and were charged with administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are speeding up the siege.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia to block one of the crossings of a railway train equipped with a trailer.
The riots broke out on the main crossing the border of the city of Ríosca, Hungary, as the Hungarians set up a service room for people to pass through the metal container, and the crowds pushed one another into it.
Some 20 people have managed to get inside, while thousands have survived.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced refusal of food and water until they were left in Hungary.
2016 elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders was reduced by two in the national survey
Former Secretary-General Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double advantage in the run of democracy for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is coming to it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of primary voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential run, is supported by 15 per cent of the first democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the initial elections, the majority of democratic voters said that they were too early to say that they had been identified with the candidate they would support.
The Clinton parties are more confident in their election than in the support of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups and Sanders has received some bonuses.
Clinton maintains a great advantage between women and the disabled, but this advantage has been reduced.
Its support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders is leaving at least 5 points.
The preference given by Clinton Democrats up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton defeated Sanders for two large numbers of liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the first democratic voters throughout the country say they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm if she had become a candidate from this party.
The fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would only support her because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It is not surprising that the current party members of Clinton are more enthusiastic about her account than ever before.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more contradictory -- only about a fourth with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of primary voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, a smaller number of Republican voters speak of their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's parties are asked the open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer - that she has the experience (16 per cent), then that she is now the president's time (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
The Clinton side also speaks of the association that links it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called according to issues and opportunities for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the first democratic voters would like him to join the race, although the third believes he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see in the second place among the party's candidates, the first democratic voters in most cases call Byden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Byden second, more than Sanders.
If Byden decides not to issue his candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden among the participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democrats are seen in Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, this figure has declined from 78 per cent in the past month.
According to the Bayden indicator, there was a high drop in second place, but the percentage of those who considered it to be the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, in response to the question that most importantly in the candidate, democratic voters choose alternative options other than opportunities to be elected.
Similarly, in the past month, none of the candidates for democracy or potential candidates are unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results from some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Byden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
The Bayden of all three is guided by honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in its leadership qualities.
Thirty per cent of primary voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who speak the same way about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on this account.
First Democrats are also generally considered to be similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Byden.
According to all these measures, about four Democrats have no idea of Sanders.
Although questions about the personal mailbox and server of Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed by its Secretary-General, most primary voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their overall view of it.
But that's all the other story in American society as a whole.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this remained open in March shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the issue of e-mail had nothing to do with their general view of Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their view had been distorted.
In particular, more than six of the 10 Republicans claim that their views on Clinton have been distorted.
Even though Clinton is considered to be honest and worthy of trust by voters from its party, this remains a problem for it among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent consider it fair and credible, at eight points below the previous month and at 15 per cent compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and worthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country are not considered to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trap both, however, receive good notes on leadership.
Six protested candidates from Byden, Carson and Bush showed a better result of honesty.
Most see Sanders as a more honest man than not, but as Carson, many have no idea.
The error rate for election from 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampu
Ben Carson came to Donald Trump in his latest CBS/New York Times
The two candidates gathered half the votes of the voters in a new interview, leaving all the others in search of shelters under their feet.
Elections throughout the country continue to support the Trapa, which has increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey, which was conducted in the past month's Fox News debate, up to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson took from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The question also showed that Carson was supported by all demographic groups, which pushed Trapa into a group of high-level voters.
The other candidates, except Carli Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, were back with Governor Viconsina Scott Walker, who supported 10 per cent last month until 2 per cent.
Former Governor Florida J. Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, are working together with 6 per cent.
An error for the election of 376 voters in this new survey was 6 per cent plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey was held in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing support for 19 per cent of the Republicans, with 32 per cent support for Trappo.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that the Trap was significantly overrun by Carson.
As for the increase in Carson's support last week, Tramp had made a number of critical failures to the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for his suspicion of Trampa's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brothers were charged with the death of the former Collegiate Baruch
About two years after the death of a college student during the ritual of the dedication of the Poko brothers in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was filed against five persons.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psy Brothers of the New York College Baruch were brutally attacked by Michael Deng during the September 2013 campaign and did not bring him to the hospital in time that led to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that the student with his eyes closed and a 30-pound walk with his back leg had been interpreted several times while he was trying to reach his goal of walking around the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Brother Pi Delta Psi didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and expected more time before he was sent to the hospital, they spoke to the police.
However, they found time to change Denga's clothes, find his symptoms in Guglie and contact Andy Mengo, the national brother-in-law, to ask for advice, as the head of police officer Chris Wagner told the press conference.
“At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to receive personal property, in fact, as the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng,” said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't save it, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the Resurrection Report, Deng received several stupid headaches, headaches and abdominal pain.
“ Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity rituals, as at least one student dies every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fairberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must take responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Moro's sworn graphs were in favour of a third-level charge of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, are charged with violence against a novel and criminal contract.
"We would like to draw on responsibility not only for individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally," Vagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
College Baruch prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a rise in rates, and the “bike market” will collapse, debt will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
We don't know how long it'll take to get there, and how long it'll last.
For the economy, history has little to do with time.
The recession took place 11 months after the first increase in rates and for all 86 months.
The strength of the Federal Reserve to raise rates is often, although not always, determined by the economic and financial response.
The Administration of the Central Bank of the United States is therefore so insistent that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates and on how much adjustment it takes.
Actually, there's a lot of change in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the seats around the rate increase are oversized.
“The first increase in the federal reserve rates with the emergence of a global financial crisis will certainly be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the era of "fashioned money", reported Julian Jessop, chief international economic specialist at Capital Economics, in his comments to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low level will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
That doesn't mean it won't work.
Here's how some areas of economy could respond depending on historical trends:
As you have seen in the last month or around the past month, the expectation of a higher rate may lead to some degree of instability.
However, when the rate is increased, the effects are usually not such as dramatic.
"It is unlikely that the income from shares would be tarnished for 12-24 months after the first leap, which is likely to reflect delays in monetary policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts have said in a recent study of the increase in the Federal Reserve rates.
If, in particular, the market for the last 35 years is rapidly changing - around 14 per cent - by increasing rates, it remains sufficiently high within 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), then, within 500 days, 14.4 per cent of the average income is returned to normal with the latest six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main trade strategy specialist in New Asset Management published in Barron's.
In Deutsche it is said that the result for the price books is not a tendency to become more pronounced at the rate-up stage, and the share income is beginning to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute to it.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that were not previously existing and may accelerate the recession.
In particular, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point during the existence of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, only 2 per cent of the nominal annual GDP since 1950 has been under 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 per cent, few believed that it was long, while in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent of what Atlanta Fed said.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background may be at risk and may raise the question of “if this is the second time” reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the rates of the federal reserve system throughout the year, including their view of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, the fair trade is only about 25 per cent likely.
“In our study since 1950, all the rates increase cycle up to this day were in the supercycle of a growing financial asset at GDP covering pre-recerection peaks very quickly after recovery,” says the report.
On the contrary, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it has been 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being done for shares.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than that of shares when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that income changes immediately after the first increase/decreasing rates in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in the rate of liability rates, the rate of liability falls immediately," reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that increasing rates will lead to a closer approach to long-term and short-term liabilities by making more flat.
High-performance obligations often lead to better conditions in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of income fluctuations", says Katy Jones, an analysis of fixed-income income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system ' s policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market is building on a more robust monetary policy perspective”, she wrote.
The interest rates for short-term loans have increased, with more flat income, more credit advances have increased, and more volatility has increased - all market features in terms of strengthening the federal system ' s policy.
In general, companies leading their major business in the United States are benefiting from an increase in interest rates and local production becomes more attractive.
International debt companies are in a worse position, as growing dollars make their production more expensive in the world market area and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"History shows that "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the market over the first three months after the increase in rates," Goldman Sachs reported to customers.
Firms with a stable financial situation have mixed the company with an unstable state as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 per cent.
High-performance capital companies as well as low-voltility shares have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent paragraphs) respectively.
The debt will become a big issue.
A high-percent debt company loses more than anything, says Goldman.
In addition to the pure exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from growing dollars.
The indicators could also be seen through higher income, although experts are spending on how fast this is going to happen.
"BC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," - adopted by a member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham
Parliamentary Conservatives member Andrew Bingham criticised the "Strengthening of Standards" station
It proves that it is becoming increasingly different from the commercial competitor
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just tied up with Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who was attacked by The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said the head of parliament, encouraging the television company to prove that it is doing something that business companies don't do.
The Conservatives Member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham, also said to the BBC leadership, which seems to be the public radio station "stupid" and is becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards prize held last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here's two examples that first came to my mind that you're just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General rejected the charge, claiming that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of his commercial opponent when it came to live music and audition.
What I know about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his devotion to live speech and the creation of music will not be equal to anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, that the interest of Radio 3 in the pursuit of new music and in the promotion of new productions," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Alan Davy said that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who had been attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the Parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical show of talents that BBC purchased at the Dutch Talpa Media for a price of 22 million pounds of sterling.
See why this programme is often discussed with regard to the lack of originality and the absence of different drawings?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which as judges were attended by Palm Fayt and Boy George, was done in "the typical BBC style".
He added that it would like the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home horse" the next time it starts a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new season The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay for the licence collection in other forms of entertainment.
The increase in internet sales has been largely slowed down in August, and this may lead to the Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, an increase in online sales was observed by seven per cent.
Last month, there has been the most slow growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been activated three years ago by using mobile equipment for shopping
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help to prevent loss
For some ten years, virtual shopping has been testing a bomb, turning many central streets in Britain into a city of sight.
However, experts say that there have now been signs of online sales imbalances after the latest data have shown only a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown a minimum growth since their beginning in 2000, with an increase of only five per cent.
Experts say that there have been signs of online sales since the latest data showed only a semi-percent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the pace of growth in the previous years and return to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkchi, editor of IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales had been activated three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online and that they could do so under any circumstances, for example, by sitting on the couch.
But now it's going out on the plate, and you can see a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing down.
Experts believe that buyers could be prevented from buying out an event that took place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times as high as the average buyers have been able to access computers in order to make good use of their offers, thus damaging a number of vendors' websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers enter this fight for profitable purchases, could force people to abstain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pounds of sterling per 5 pounds is spent online.
With regard to such goods as television and steel machines, more than one third of them are sold via the Internet.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and dress online than in fashion shops on central streets.
Muslims buried dead when the crown fell in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family was penalized
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead people on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people in general were also injured after the hurricane.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the country have gone to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the damage to the main Mecca tomb.
The prisoners, mainly in white, who were present at the funerals, filled a passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead who had taken their last way to Al-Moissem camp.
The construction process went beyond the sacred site, where several days earlier, the building crane broke down and fell to the ground.
The bodies were handed down for burial, and at the same time the king of Saudi had destroyed a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family, which also had 394 injured.
29 bodies of people killed in the destruction of the crown in the Main Hall were taken across the streets
Among the casualties was the father of four children, Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the Palmyon when he broke his skull.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Meeting with his parents before the start of the annual event.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the march in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the gun that had been fired at the unemployed.
In the Arabic version of the decree published by the Government agency Saudi Press, Binladin Group states that it is a part of the blame for the breach.
The English news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to explain the reason for the fall in the capital camp, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were injured in order to go to jail this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about damage to the crown, and its representatives did not appear to be available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of non-use of modern security measures and inappropriate coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Tens of the crowns are surrounded by the main mesh of Mecca, under the extensive construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The Laden family has been a close family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
The late leader Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was the son-in-law of which the family rejected in the 1990s.
The disaster occurred at strong winds and rain in a few days before millions of people came into the kingdom for their participation in palmism, which is mandatory even once in their lives for every hardworking Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million Rials (about 174,000 pounds) to relatives who lost their lives, and the same amount would not be recovered.
The remaining injured will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronic Lori, Britain is increasingly looking for repair specialists
Number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe is growing
Results - opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher has closed 60 B&Q warehouses throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent Daily Mail
Britons are said to have retired from milk and dairy kitchens, and instead they hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do domestic work.
If you're able to contact a kid or a wolf to paint a wall, it's like you're a minority in our day.
Because, according to B&Q, the British are increasingly recruiting teachers to carry out house-to-house work.
Veronic Lauri, new Director-General Kingfisher, managing the household equipment network, reported that this trend is a significant trend for qualified teachers from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specializing in master goods and close 60 B&Q stores simultaneously.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q magazine staff, as eight out of ten decisions on the purchases in the magazine were taken by the representatives of the weak sexes.
At present most of the staff are men.
It said that the latest demographic trends, which were characterized by increasing the number of households belonging to single women, were more likely to be used to equip their homes than in the past.
Ms. Lori said: "In our shops, men are still working very well.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods obtained are taken by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in the role of leading British companies whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers, which was obtained from the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and the Director-General.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women in the Board of Directors was not difficult.
After the group had taken the cost of closing shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profit and profit sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops
Time of decision on the percentage of the United States Federal Reserve
The World monitors the United Nations Reserve Bank meeting, which discusses an important decision within two days, whether to raise or not for the first time in the last decade.
The question of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would be going to do so now believe that it would still be timed and maintained at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we agree that the main bank can draw from zero notes and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Anhal Kille, head of the Peterson International Economic Institute.
The U.S. economy works effectively and economic benefits add trillion dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared to change, but all of them spoke of their conviction that all chances of such a move would be counterproductive.
The decision will be announced at 2000 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" the hundreds of refugees in the Horgosh crossing point on the Serbian-Venger border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for immigrants.
Refugees are already starting to break other routes in the EU.
One of them is located across the border with Serbia.
Secondly, through Croatia and Slovenia, in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The leaders were authorized by the authorities to follow without delay.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboja Stepanovic believes that his country is doing its best to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people to ensure a humane relationship with them.
But it's already a general European problem.
To solve it simply, no country in Europe alone will deal with it, and therefore a smaller country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has not proposed:
If someone is called a refugee, he should fill in Serbia the necessary documents for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country because Serbia is completely safe.
Hungary has already carried out a 175-thi-kilometre border crossing with Serbia.
But Orban remains unintended: he plans to bring the same siege on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangleis Meymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vangleis Memarakis has been involved in the law centralist governments, which, in the view of the left, have brought the country into financial crisis.
Now he has become the time leader of the New Democracy Party, and he's facing the challenges of Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Eronius.
Evronius: Mr. Memarakis, please welcome to Evronius!
Vangleis Meymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euroonius: Nine months ago your party suffered a devastating defeat by entering the Syrian coalition, but now, the judge on the question, "New Democracy" compared it with its popularity.
What's changed in this time?
Vangleis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece benefited from the budget and economic growth prospects.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors went away because Mr. Cyprus missed them.
In the last nine months, Greece had been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Cyprus ' s false promises.
And now they can easily compare what has been promised to happen.
The daily life was significantly lower than in January when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens doing so.
Eurionius: But you say that if you win the elections, you will strive to join other parties, including the SIRIZ.
Vangleis Meymarakis: The fact that, as we have seen in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where there have been or are still programmes of salvation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme they have agreed not to give up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only cooperation between political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euroonius: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement or will you at least try to change it?
Vangleis Meymarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece on a European road, because we are well aware of the harmful effects that the EU would have on its exit.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the Hungarian package and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost without a treaty with Europe.
But the current serious economic measures have been the result of Mr. Cyprus's negotiation.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to make arrangements, acts reasonably and understands that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am convinced that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can become a subject of negotiations, but only within a limited period of time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we can return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continue to benefit from EU funding and the greater investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus had not provided any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have clarified in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not about fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that ministers of Cyprus never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euroonius: If you win the election, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Uncker, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Would it be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangleis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried our best to implement the 2012 agreement with its sharp angles.
We've been moving ahead of reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we were in an emergency.
The market fell, and there was no apparent potential buyers ready to pay the price imposed by the Greek Government.
I was the speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree with the views of the three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the majority of the Government.
Despite their serious ideological differences in key legislation, we had a working Parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that had taken place.
And we were able to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not interrupted by the temporary general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euroonius: The last weeks on Greece's territory have been a massive stream of refugees.
What do you think of the situation and the reaction of the European countries in which these people are seeking?
Vangleis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a bomb of slow action that we should have to deal with after the election victory.
The reason for the failure of the Syrian Government to act in this situation was the case.
Such issues should be taken into account because, if you are faced with a problem, there are only emergency measures.
And we're in that situation right now.
Even the interim government that changed Sirizu has done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus has done in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the Interim Government, which are invaluable to the President of the Republic calling for an EU summit, will allow him to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and we need to see how many refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, victims of some of the extraordinary events that took place with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will maintain the positions that European policies should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at EU summits, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this serious problem.
Mr. Memarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangleis Meymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Dražkovka Donatska, during the course of the Chief Military Investigation Officers, the area was established and detained by a 34-year-old Ukrainian military officer from the city of Kryvoy Rog (Dnepropetrov area), who was late at night during the joint use of alcohol and the conflict in the village of the Upper Yasinovat region of Donatkin, which had been shot out of the car in his opposition.
The report of 22-year-old boy's injury came from a hospital where he was hospitalized with severe foot wounds.
As described by Artem Vasicki, Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigation of the Chief of Police, during the operational activities of the law enforcement officer, the figure was still involved in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operators found that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local population, which led to a fatal head injury.
The following Division of the Friends of the GMO opened criminal proceedings under articles “Muslim murder” and “Muslim torture” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detained person is threatened with deprivation of liberty by 15 years.
The Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility and reported to the Danish police station.
Two of the inhabitants of Novosibirska, who decorated the Ukrainian flag with several Soviet monuments, including two of Vladimir Lenin's monuments, were sentenced by the Russian court to prison.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to deprivation of liberty.
The prison term for the inhabitants of Novosibirska was sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years of imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons were deprived of their liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirska recognized the four towns as guilty of vandalism against the Leninan monuments located on the territory of the KPRF and on the Trikatajan Road and the Memorial of the Monument of Praise.
In the last case, the catechism plant and T-34 tank were decorated.
Remember, on the night of December 12th in the Russian Novosibirsk, the unknowns decorated the Ukrainian flag with military technology at the Memorial of Glory.
A civil wife of the popular Russian actor Eugenia Ciganov Irina Leonov was born to the seventh child.
A girl appeared in the light at one of Moscow's clinics.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Remember, the Chicago and Leonov have recently disappeared.
The comments were rejected.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions.
Eugania Chiganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theatre Master Peter Fomenco.
Films known as "Progulka", "Cosmos as a precaution", "Brestle courage", "Ottepel" and "Farza".
On 8 September, Eugenia Ciganov was recognized as the Acter of the Year and as the Man of the Year of the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
A man who opened a shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
After his friend was shot and killed in Mississippi on Monday - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he "spent" about the first murder and wished to "get back" the authorities informed on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gotai, Mississippi, reported that the teacher of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 o'clock in the morning.
On Monday, he reported he shot someone.
Lamb told the inspector that the police had to send people home to him.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "peachy" in the house that "no-one will go down" but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the gun.
When he arrived at the crime scene, the police discovered Amy Prentiss' body, 41 years old, and a written note from Lamba, 45 years old, saying: "I am sorry I wish I could return everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
In writing the note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and on Monday night when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
The director of the University of William Laforz reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lambo and Schmidt, but "in Mr. Lamba there was obviously something smart."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb proposed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday that “no information or evidence” was “not available”.
He called Prentiss a "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They got divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "unsuspecting."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "close friends."
According to Lindsey Noulz, whose newspaper San Gerald calls his close friend Prentiss, the last one worked from home via the Internet.
Noulz told me that Prentiss had a hot dog on the Leaching call and that she met Lambo for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say "he won't go to jail."
On the same night when the police arrived at his six "1" station near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, escaped into the woods and shot there.
According to a summary on the university site, in February 2015, Lamb was awarded a PhD at the University of Delta.
The Stars Who Lost Their Success
The actor (left), on the photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year life satellite Farru Fosset, who died from cancer.
The actor was reportedly also suffering from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008.
All of this, of course, played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United chose for several months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the Battle of the League of Champions, in which Manchester United won PSV in Andean.
While the protector survives because he cannot go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during the indiscriminate defeat of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw returned to the PSV penal zone.
They helped him in the field for nine minutes and gave him oxygen before he could get into the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's in a double beat, and he's in the hospital."
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or later, and then they'll work.
It was a terrible young man who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, overcome great difficulties and became fantastically playing, and it happened here.
There was a oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double beat, it's for six months, and the boy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Moreno said he didn't get a red card and no pens.
Arbitr Nicholas Riccoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a pencil and a red card.
It was a very bad foot-and-mouthed suit.
She writes in her Twitter: "Thank you all for your messages, don't describe how I am relieved, my way of recovery begins, I'll be back stronger than I was."
More on: Manchester United survives an accident with Luke Shaw when he hits the game with PSV
The English protector will be further encouraged to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Philip Koku, a PSV trainer, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any game comes with such trauma, it's all very confusing.
It was never our game's intention to rape the opponent.
Moreno transferred his leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gala at the 2014 Peace Championship.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," said Koku.
I didn't have a chance to see myself.
The only thing I could see was the sword that flew in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreneo) had kissed him, but I didn't see a clue under Luke.
In a discussion with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know it's the one I know how hard it is to carry.
I'm really tired, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guaardo from PSV was also transferred to the hospital after he met Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorakse?
Each parent takes one thing very quickly: If your child likes a book, it will take some time to get to know her almost unwelcome.
Let's see if you're not just David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the company dealing with child rest in Canicula, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental statement written by Dr. Süzo in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the company SuperCamps website, and he continued: "This is a happy, attractive, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always contains any picture or message we pass on."
It would be all right, in addition to the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to reexamine the contents of the book, but in fact it is related to a single film taken in 2012, with new personnel and details added to diversify enough short original narratives.
"In the high-walled town of Vsmenujville, where there were no greens and even the air was sold for money, a man named Ted is hoping to strike the heart of Audrey -- the girls of his dream -- to see this tree," we read in the text of a love story that Dr. Suuz (now Theodor Suez Hazel) died in 1991.
If this seems insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost like a short presentation of the "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Vsemnujville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Audrey - girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameroon, in general recognition, is an active parent, so unaware of the contents of a book that does not name a boy, learns how to destroy the environment of a wild-grained tree breeder and of the Nahokins, despite the protests of Loraksa (called the book) - a funny substance with all those who “speak on behalf of trees”.
Soon after all, such an uncomplicated PR task was assigned to the executive, who never read a book about Loraks 20 times.
The representative of Dajum-Strit stated that the text was supposedly obtained from the Cameroon office in the electoral area.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text had been obtained from Cameroon's headquarters but no further comments had been followed.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that there was no risk of falling into England, but that was still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you see the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the re-connaissance in the 3-0 test series, which took place last time, I do not think likely.
I wouldn't have excluded winning on my field either.
Commander Alister Kuka may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are games to be played with virulent rounds, and collective thinking strong; they will not bring with them frames from 2012 but only youth's position.
With a sword, Moen Ali turns into a revolver, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown test level figure, is an offensive option.
More on: Adam Lite chose from England for the test call and replaced by Alex Heelz
The decision to exclude Adam Lita from me, his main trainer in Yorkshire, is understood to be difficult to analyse.
Its seven test matches had two good attacks in complex conditions, and it was obvious, but the harsh reality is that games in cricket are evaluated by judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this declaration because (and I mentioned earlier) games were the best choice.
The couple were broken, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own trial.
Let's hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main trainer in England, Trevor Bailles, spoke well of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he was primarily a team game, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the test critic leaves himself a hard question.
Lite played seven games, like Sam Robson to him, and Nick Compton to nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on his foreign field.
The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lite was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity was in the past.
There's Alex Hills, and he's the one I highly value.
He's an unpredictably cricketist that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he hired 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
At least he must be given the same opportunity as those before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
My wish to put Moena along with Kuko as an open witness would give me an opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, keeping four fast fighters, I think, and I am not against it at all.
I don't see why the current game can't kill a sword there, but the left has already shown that he's a good cartoonist.
Moen, maybe not all he needs for his own graffiti, but it's a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches with "third hitsman" before leaving as an open in 2001.
He won at once three hundred and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari is coming to a meeting as a reserve spinner, and soon I became very promising young man to him.
People can look at his example statistics - on average 31 with a bit and 35 with a sword - and think that this is a risk rate, but among the spinners who voted "for" a little, and elected youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make practical additions to the training process.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, Sri Lankan poet, as a consultant for test kittens could be a master step.
He's one of the best guys in the game that will bring her the richest experience of all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where white swords are used and will provide both energy and free pace in the web.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international crisis, whether it is a game or a training work, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the section, even if they say what has been said earlier, can give new forces to the team.
My colleague Collie on Darema Ben Stokes has been left for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break with Australia, and I do not, for example, try this problem.
Although not all agree with this, coaches and players do not specify the schedule.
And you have to remember how games, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The United Kingdom's Euro-Association Camp can be won if the economy is depressed by 2017
The unprovoked policy of David Cameron to resume the negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU every day is experiencing more and more difficulties, even with regard to the choice of generic Jeremy: "Yes or no?" -- Corbin, leader of the Liberians or non-TUC on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their corbins and Nigel Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained on days that, in the situation in which the EU is currently experiencing various crises - not all of its own production - some countries parties are sitting on the roof of the British self-centered agenda of the current set of assumptions and disturbing agreements that they do not want in particular.
At the annual meeting in Briton, TUC decided that he would not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the Dave and George Self Program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are shot at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves on the background of a known local memory, in or without local identity companies, then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to keep Britain's external contacts under the European Union's roof - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - suggests that foreign ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when everything is equal, we will stay or go.
Angela Merkel, a very careful German Chancellor, is a Union, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation gets worse for her, as she has been disappointed with those who sit in her place of Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, the Netherlands, stands before the re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power, too.
Poland can soon receive the Nationalist Government of the Right, Spain, to the Left.
It was difficult to see them falling off their skin to help themselves, whose energy could be lost to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - which they also do not want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue a non-profit note in the style of SNP during the 2017 referendum campaign in Great Britain in order to follow the EU's exit process, my friend assumes.
"Review was an idea-fix" and "British got nothing valuable from renegotiated negotiations".
Europeans in their poverty know what can be the Fleet Street, and how the media-magnati are designed for the EU, unlike the Tony Benn referendum launched in 1975, which supported our introduction in 1973 to 2:1.
They may be sad to remember Boris Johnson, a Euro-porter indicted, who was celebrated by his "indirect EU bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a shooting company from fear-induced juicy taxes, telephone hackers and pseudo-neighbourishers, who hold most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same idea of them, but he reported that when you're in a fight-gun cell, you should give her bananas to pull her off and don't give her a lunch and a cup of tea.
In fact, Millibend was more committed than Blair himself to the idea of Cameroon's referendum, as Blair was guided by the principles of the EU's repealed constitution, which were buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But poor Jeremy Corbin, who got me behind the back of Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't have time to take it on me -- looks like he's risking repeating the 80th-century "Merdoku Boy" strategy -- a mistake, and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marrom, who is exactly where he sits in the VVS.
The official position of the Corbin for Europe is that I deliberately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
In fact, most people outside the traditionalist trend of the Ukip and a wider circle of "little English" parties in the middle of the tower can probably say yes.
It's the same thing that Hillary, "Benn but Not Bennet," said on radio and TV this week, while his inner fighter refused to admit that the appointment of Corbin, the "Ten" finance minister, John McDonnell, was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s when his great-father was on TV for infidelity with his colleagues at the Liberian Cabinet, not far away and did not lose his post in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the fight to remain “in any circumstances” - Benna’s phrase - is not what MacDonnell said, and not what J. K. spoke to the press and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general.
To tell us about democracy and "your boyfriend" Corbin, remember, he has even taught me - the discipline of messages remains important in the roundabout seven days a week, especially in water social networks, panic attacks and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameroon to leave Europe so simply, allowing it to accept as appropriate the support of the Liberians during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks so.
But MacDonnell's and Corbin's main error in EU membership - within the "Bennit" economy of the restored stability - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among the left dissidents, for which Narcissism, born of a minor difference, is a central principle in doctrinal disputes.
With regard to his errors about Nato-Tom Watson, the J.K. will not be aggrieved by the exit, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it home to their leaders.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspicious voters - at Britain's approach when this could be pointless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Tori has reduced the costs I have been reminded of on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of public health England ' s electronic cigarettes
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less valuable than smoking have resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to tobacco industry as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) along with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - "reversible cow" last month, calling it "the overall review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed out that some experts were involved in tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized "excessively dry evidence" on which PHE had built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements were "hard or weak".
Martin McKiy, teacher of European Health Organization at the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less valuable than tobacco" are based on a detailed selection of evidence and models.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria analysis model to sum up their views on the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are presented in scientific publications.
McKi and Capewell reported that one of the congregation sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously been informed by the Director-General that he had received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
It also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced that he had received funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, who was not aware of the funding he had received earlier from Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the election of members of the Council, but there were several known electronic cigarettes parties, some of whom also stated that the industry was funded by the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by a tobacco director at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group "explains" that there is a lack of "high evidence of the adverse impact of most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKi and Kapwell said that PHE's statements that "there is no evidence at present that electronic cigarettes are expensive to bring children or non-smoking" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less valuable than tobacco."
One of the two smokers has died of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility for informing the public about what it proves and what it does not prove, especially where there have been concerns about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and NHS is spent on 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only bear part of the damage caused by smoking -- we are carrying out our tasks before the nation.
Former Chapter Channel 4 considers that BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop issuing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, pointing out that their business competitors would have much to do with the successful show, such as the oil opera on the "Albert Square".
Johnson noted that licence collections should only be used to establish programmes that are not issued by other British television companies.
He was critical of the company's public awareness transfer, which the creditor sees only a small part of the audience, at a time when competitionrs come to show with high ratings, and on channels like BBC4.
After told Director General BBC Tony Hall that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had failed to cooperate with BBC during channel 4.
"I cannot separate from the idea that BBC is preparing for launch and transmitting transfers that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the Chamber of Lords in the light of the further ruling of the BBC.
If you maintain a licence collection that I do not believe to be a good decision in the medium and long-term perspective, companies should leave only those programmes that are not issued and are not intended to be issued by other companies.
Show The Voice is going out in the air in the spring because the creators want to get as much support as possible in the future.
The idea that no one else would ever show it again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be financed by transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would be too much for her.
I don't understand how this can be public awareness.
I don't think that's something that's going to bring down BBC.
Major entrepreneur Johnson, head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of being being “abstained from staff ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on BBC's most popular show are echoed by the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture at MacTaggarta in Edinburgh in 2003, proposed that BBC sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that lower public BBC transfers " continue to go to BBC4 where they are often unable to assess the audit, but that is why the company's function is carried out, and this can be presented as an argument in the hanji sermons justifying income from the licensing collections of 4 billion pounds: "Well, of course, we do all these infinite transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a castle where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing collection, Johnson told the Committee: "I call on you to find a more restrictive system with regard to who will receive more.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people with 150 pounds a lot of money, I'm interested in them because they don't look very much and listen to BBC.
Former Executive Director for Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for "information, education and recreation".
He noted that only a small part of the BBC outputs are now formally classified as educational - it is said that 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on radio - and that the company should support the initiative of Australian and Canadian real estate companies with “information, lighting and entertainment”.
Elstein noted that more efforts should be made in areas such as the “Translated concerts” (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as in alliances with commercial intelligence companies to make them available for online review.
Sonogenetics enables the brain cells to control sound waves
The video shows how different movements change at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses.
Scientists have removed red with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
Cross-sectional disorders change the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high, so that the human ear can hear them.
Impulsions are affected by the activation of neutrons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on: Researchers manage brain activity through the world
Scientists have said that reds demonstrate the potential of a new method called "sonogenetics", which is used in the use of ultrasound to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is available outside the body.
Sri Lankan, a scientist at the Institute of Solca, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain - an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into the human brain and which is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Red nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in fluids containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the lungs are intensifying ultrasound waves that then penetrate the red body.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the structures called TRP-4 ion channels discovered in the membranes of some red cells.
The ultrasound waves force these ion channels to open up and stimulate cells connected to them are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create a non-module that can be managed through ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic changes to the reds, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were made up of microscopic tubes and introduced into red organisms by enabling modified motor neurons.
This approach is similar to what is used in optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani argues that compared with this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light supplied to the desired brain by the eyelids, low ultrasound waves pass continuously through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to be carried inside the cervix.
"We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will enable human neurons to make ultrasound signals sensitive at the time," Chalasani said.
He added that the methodology could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is right on your side!
Advertising is made available on British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's role in protesting the arms race.
Screaming drones!
A devastating wave of rail canals!
The tape bombs!
Electric light bulbs causing irreparable pain but not leaving traces!
The bold voice and painted animation leave no doubt that this declaration of the greatest international arms show is a bridge prepared by Amnesty International with a view to drawing attention to the British Government ' s intention to "repressive" arms by means of an exCeL-centred demonstration of defence technologies and security systems.
More on: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes go to London
However, the special campaign also led to the sudden appearance of many posts on bus stops and on metro trips that required their attention again.
"An important declaration going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" was written in one of the letters of the London metro with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a number of arms dealers are burning at the DLR line. Passengers are asking for help in reducing the exposure to weapons.
300 posters were drawn by artists who performed their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in the Banksy Dismalland Park.
A collection called the Special Patrol Group has helped to spread them across London, using the “computer of advertising sites”, the 6-point set of key keys, which is said to be “providing access to about three commercial space on the bus stop of the planet”.
London transporters are not happy with such “wandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the family statements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go to a real world because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons that welcome passengers by metro.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a VCCP agency working on bonus, attracting a graphic designer and sound artist who also works free of charge.
The creative director, VCCP Matt Lever, was hit by a silent round of arms exhibitions - passing the ExCel calendar - and he thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "filled her home with bright colors and animations has become more exciting".
"They have certainly helped us to focus on selling illegal torture equipment on exhibitions," said Tom Davis from Amnesty.
We now need the Government of Great Britain to take action and to ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold directly to our enemy.
It is possible that the most creative art on the subject of weaponry is within ExCeL, where participants are selling fantastically falsified products.
In the press release Saab disclosed the order for "AT4CS RS for shooting with a stick", issued by the U.S. Army.
It includes “non-analogous convulsive warfare, which provides uninterrupted internal defence action”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student communities
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student community as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in pregnancy and moral relativism, but I'm just now remembering the many long-term complaints I have made about others.
The main thing I've learned is the eight simple rules.
The transition to society can vary from one that is active on the nerve to one that is totally scary.
He encourages pain: to tell people where you took your academic leave and where you did it, whether you supported Corbin and why you're "true, I don't love, I hate "Marmat", because, seriously, the boy, it's just a friendly HAHAHAHA extract, I'll be with you."
Breathe.
And help others to breathe is also to ask questions and show interest.
This will help you find people who like you and who would never even talk to you, even if they burned your shirts and sold you as a burnt offering.
Let's give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, seminal cinemas and public places, but they are also the place where people dress and dress lower whites.
Still on the subject: You don't even want to start training at a university when you're in a relationship
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room should be a shelter, but many communities form a culture of living in one room, which contributes to friendship, community and long-term friendships.
It can be a human for someone who is trying to regain power.
There's nothing in culture that makes you say, "I like you, and I want to keep you friends, but I need you to go out, and I've been able to restore the energy I've spent together with you."
Try to feel when the offender is upset by the crowd, not getting in touch with him, but sending text messages.
Come on, come on. Do it.
A young man in my community followed this principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to go.
He saw something.
Make friends by taking care of them.
Since you're starting a university life on the stage of the popular Bake-Off show, I'm going to put people in the door to introduce and teach you a chocolate pie, - no more such a weird act, not to mention the 1950s with them "Well, we're neighbors, I've got something for you, and now you're going to get down and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home facilities is a great way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to kiss you, and as a result, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course it depends on how good you are.
Badly covered pieces of pain, drought and thirst will soon make people fall asleep when you meet them.
Eating is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, the use of a chicken is a cow, but is it the same thing as a cow - take a feel-a-a-a milk for a tea?
Call the milk owner.
Sooner or later, he'll offer you not to be distracted, even if you're in a hurry.
If someone comes up with your stuff, it's embarrassing, and I feel like you. But try to take it back to an adult than my neighbor who put it in his milk so that he can get rid of those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise that's gonna make people sleep or learn.
Not only to be a suitable man but also because you're the same people talking about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to enjoy the sound of the drum and bass guitar, as it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor's response increased the tension.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours and then stole his music and locked the door behind him, headed for a three-hour exam.
Isn't it romantic if your future husband lived in the same society as you?
On the other hand, it would not be extraordinary, until the locker was broken, even if you had taken a neighbor for your future husband, got in touch with him, had relations with him, and should have seen him every day, and perhaps watched him turn his back on his side of all your common friends?
Of course, you won't show your heart, but if your burning neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool your own sand.
At that interesting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside your own locked room, the gap between the play and the trauma is more intense than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns into a contradiction for the seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson about safety, and I've got something -- but don't ever pack any room with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
Close the foreign door and drop the keys into the water tank that you're gonna put in the freezer -- but don't swear another thing by the Blue-Tack claret about twice.
iOS 9: how to set up a new operating system on iPhone after an Apple update
A new operating system can be requested to choose General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, your phone will allow you to jump and set it up.
Some have faced problems after installation when an error report appeared telling them that “Renewal of the application has not been made”.
In order to avoid this, users are advised to either wait until they are healed or try to recover through iTunes.
The phone calls will allow you to pass the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase free space, but Apple has reduced the likelihood of this action, reduced the size of the update, and has also facilitated implementation with the assistance of a special utility that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
You can be sure that your phone is damaged or there is a set of devices to prevent the battery from running.
If you are too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone order in the process may lead to an update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary John Kerry called on his Russian colleague Sergey Lavour to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support given by Moscow to President Assad is only due to intensifying the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia ' s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secret Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Asada from Russia poses a risk of deepening and widening the conflict and has a negative impact on our overall objective of combating extremism - unless we continue to focus on ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of authority," the representatives of the United States Department said.
They also noted that Kerry has repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to fight the “Islamic State” in coalitions from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in its efforts to oppose the Islamic State".
Last Friday, the representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
In fact, the press secretary of the White House, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: "When the President decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the trumpet and try to make the call."
Sam Barak Obama considers Russia ' s decision to increase support for Assad ' s “progressive rate” regime.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that Asada's continued support would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and the situation got worse," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts shall be exempt from payment of customs duties.
Mini-economic development is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other swimming facilities for rest and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes in the list of goods for temporary non-permanent import were prepared by the Ministry of the Government of the RF.
In this regard, Elena Laškina, Assistant Minister for Economic Development, reported on the " Emissions " .
In June 2015, RF Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev ordered a number of departments -- Miniconravitia, Minénovation, Ministransu RF, Mincultura, MID, MICs, FSB, FTS, Rosturismo -- to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for hunting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance.
Owners prefer to keep their court outside the border - about €200 million are being punished every year by European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of buildings.
Russia ' s Mining Development has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on "To make changes to the List of Goods temporarily imported with the full exemption from customs duties and taxes " requiring full exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported goods and other floating instruments for rest and sport.
According to the Ministry, this will undoubtedly help to create favourable conditions for the development of heating in the coastal areas of the country, Laškina noted.
The question was addressed to the Customs and Non-tariff Sub-Commission on Customs Control, Measures to Protect the External Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September and was also approved by the Chambers.
As the representative of the Minoronomic Development noted, the proposed measure for the full conditional release of imports was in its entirety beneficial.
Thus, following the adoption of the protocol to the meeting of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Minoro-Democratic Commission would submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EFTA States, Laschkin explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from customs duties includes the goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance, and so on, among them, official equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control equipment, drilling equipment, scene equipment and decorations, transportation laboratories and master cars, motorcycles, motor vehicles, sports equipment, books, magazines, magazines, magazines, magazines and magazines.
In the press service of the Red Cross, the Red Cross "Effects" reported that they had prepared mandatory regulations on seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Fedosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small, sports and sailing vessels at seaport.
The Mintras instructed the Captains of the Seaports of Crimea to make use of the simplified procedure for the approach of small-scale, sporting and long-term vessels to the seaport and the exit of listed vessels from the seaport.
Montrans has also prepared projects by the Government of the RF Government on the approval of the coastal limits of the coastal ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Fedos, the remaining members of the agreement were already in place, as noted in the press office.
According to Mintrans, Governor, Classification and Evidence, registration of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it was extremely difficult to get by because of poor infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, that is the whole of the ever-growing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, however, everything is in place.
Our coast is a small, one-off coast where we can operate trains around the year. It's the Black Sea in the region of Sochi, Holland, Novorosie, Anap.
However, it is a major challenge that border service rules are very strict in this area: a mass of permits must be drawn up in order to travel.
At the same time, within Russia, you were even somewhere to go.
Two days she can go with her heat, and then a problem arises where to take it, says Nordmarine Dennis Novikov, the sales director.
With regard to the place of storage, there are now special gears for the summer up to 30 hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also being sent to the warehouse in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Newspapers noted that buyers were rich people, but at the beginning of the crisis, demand for harvests declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the international organization ' s press service.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures for the implementation of the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," he said.
The Director of the World Bank of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimyao Fanan, said that bank sector reforms would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and had observed the first signs of stabilization in the World Bank.
However, because of the serious problems Fann calls on the Government of Ukraine to speed up reform.
In the past, the Polish Government approved the provision of a loan of €100 million in Ukraine, giving the RIA News.
Prisoners are asked to create separate blocks for transmitters.
The Public Council of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Rights of Judges in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate block blocks for transmitters and forwarders.
A member of the Council of Vladislav Grib told about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who have not been convicted of adultery, individual cameras, blocks or even (if there are many such offenders) may be provided with a special column for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to determine the fate of civilians in such isolated places only after the conviction of the relevant medical experts, which prove that the criminal is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Governor Grib was convinced that the isolation of transmitters from other prisoners would ensure the safety of the punishments.
According to him, the proposed practice is successful abroad: the SIZO (where the accused are before the court's judgment) has separate cameras for transmitters and the correctional facilities are special blocks.
Today it is the only way out of working with such criminals.
They must also be isolated, since the presence of transiters and transmitters in normal rooms is dangerous for them, that is suffering for their families and the sea for FSIN staff.
The downsizing of traffic on the part of the socammers is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of offenders with an indefinite gender, it is necessary to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZO's separate cells don't need only cameras, prison blocks.
Yeah, a separate column is possible if there's a lot of transmitters.
As Grib explained, 50 or 100 persons can be held in the block, and if a specialized body is established in Russia alone, prisoners of sex will be able to escape from any region.
Citizens are in SIZO at the crime scene, so the arrival of smugglers or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and judicial process is unrealistic, and this is how Grib feels about those who have already been convicted in a separate colony.
Remember, it was not possible for law enforcement officers to determine in which case a male or female insulator was detained for the use of 24-year-old Dmitria Kojukova, known as Alina Davis, why a man with a girl was not arrested outside.
He's been released from the house under a visa.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, as there is no mechanism for the containment of transmitters in SIZO and colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, activist LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nicolai Aleksev supported the idea of setting up special places for the punishment of transgenders, noting that it was also possible to identify people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own will.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is very small, but the problem exists, as is the issue of security for homosexuals in prisons, says Aleksey.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be done on behalf of homosexuals, more than they were in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexev doubted that there were many citizens in Russia who were willing to give themselves out for transsexual purposes in order to survive in a different way from the usual colony.
Of course, medical evidence can be provided before people are placed in a colony for transgenders, but not always identical.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning, looked like a man, and already in prison, said he wanted to change his mind, Alexev said.
A man can feel as comfortable as he can.
However, while there are no specific places for the punishment of transmitters, I doubt that prison officials will be concerned about the safety of such persons and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the International Health Expert on Reproductive Health in the Territory of RF Boris Lordkipanide noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could seriously delay the beginning of the sentence.
The Commission is created, which is a matter of sexology, which is a long-term observation by psychiatrists, not a test on which high-level conclusions are being made.
Today's psychiatry possibilities allow this.
That is why, even before changing sex, potential patients are always undergoing such experiments -- they show exactly whether changing sex with surgery is the necessary measure, says Lord Kipanide.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the accused, since the average of such an investigation is about a month.
Doctors, although the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals was generally supported, are also concerned that, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to believe that there are no official statistics, but if there are around 5 per cent gays in Russia, it can be said that transgenders are even less than those who have this refusal and still commit crimes, at least a small number, Lord Kipanide said.
At the time of application before the administration of the Gomosexuality colony, the transgenders may receive certain conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won a junior peace championship on chess.
In Hunty Mansieska, a peace campaign was concluded among the young up to 20 years of age.
The conclusion of the premise was more intriguing than it was.
The winner was determined only on the last tour and became Russian Michael Antipov, who was able to push the Jana Kshistof Dudu, which would probably go to the title.
In the girl's victory, the Ukrainian chessman Natalie Bucks celebrated.
The World Chess Championship, which took place in Hunty Mansica since early September, has already been in the middle of the tournament, said to have lost almost everything, since the representative of Poland, Jan Kshistof Duda, released a series of four victories (serving is conducted by the Swiss system in 13 tournaments), certainly took the lead.
In view of the fact that Duda was a prime minister's rating, although it is generally considered one of the most promising young shhammatists, the likelihood that he would lose his good fortune was very small.
And even when Duda got rid of the trade and allowed Russian Michel Antipus to reduce the rest of everything to 0.5 balls, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight against title.
In order to win the leader, it was necessary to win the 13th round.
But it wouldn't even help if it didn't help to win Doda's party.
In addition, this obligation of victory could, of course, be attributed to the game of the Russian chessman and lead to unwarranted mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was sure to have a meeting with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for his party to end with Doda, who met Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipova, the Polish chessman brought opposition to the Dutch last night.
Thus, the Antipos and the Dudas collected the same number of eggs - 10 out of 13 possible ones, but Antipoov had the best additional indicators.
The leadership of the Hunty-Mansiian autonomous district, which Natalya Komarova has traditionally given great attention to the development of the shahamat in the region, has given the main prize.
And there were no intrusive girls in the encounters.
The tournament leader, Natalia Buckse (Ukraine), was not able to win the title enough in the last round, which she did successfully.
Thus, the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, did not allow her to beat Alex.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with a distance from the championship in 0.5 balls.
The gap changes the regional structure.
The company combines the Privoj and Ural region into one of the largest regions of the Volgic-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East in the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Director of Impelcoma, Michael Slobodin, noted, changes are being made to "be a strong market game", to develop a company "in new, not always favourable external conditions".
Mr. Slobodin, in his telephony, Mr. Slobodin, explained that they intended to reduce the "ten per cent" of staff in Russia.
The headmaster checked 78 Moscow's delicious Burger King and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, a restaurant in the Volocolamas has been charged with 50 thousand rubs, and the High Tull Street has been closed for 90 days, but it has resumed its work since all the violations have been eliminated.
43 officers have violated the requirements for premises.
Among other violations were inadequate sanitation and hygiene facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, some plants were detected by the bacteria of the fluid cell.
France on the brand Burger King is owned by OO Burger Russ, owner of the "Schocoladnica" network, Alexandra Colobavo, and works 293 restaurants in Russia.
Igor Artemev, head of the FAS, said that the anti-indication office was 10 per cent of freight and gas subsidies, as requested by the OAO RJD.
At first they wanted 17 per cent indexing, now they wanted 10 per cent, and also billions of budget subsidies, he says.
We're saying it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much, you're going to lower your costs, you're going to learn to save, you're going to give up expensive features, football teams, your own TV, you're gonna stop spending money on the left and right.

In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumer up to $80 million (a difference between the price of the issue of shares for Sumer and market shares), which may be taken from a free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement options or to require additional payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was set up for the purchase of Polymetal project "Kazill" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtor: Address food assistance will not become an analogue card in the SSR.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, said that the food aid programme would not be an analogue to the food distribution system existing in the SSR.
This is about the current address of food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to look at the word "food card".
In particular, it should be noted that the proposed product cards should not be accompanied by a total deficit, the card distribution system, with the number of products obtained.
We have still proposed a concept if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," said Mr. Evtukhov.
" E " previously wrote that the food carding programme for poor people was introduced into the Government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1,000 Russian Managers" is conducted on 16 occasions.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of the Russian managers of the upper ear, the study results from the work of the Russian authorities annually, identifying leaders in the industry and in the functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of laureates dating last year.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year ' s rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the original list is invited to appoint up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the total number of candidates.
It is possible to move the following executive directors from the company: Financial Director, Business Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Relations Director, Authority Relations Director, Corporate Management Director.
Each expert proposed by the manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to appoint its management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The promotion of industrial applications is based on the industrial classification of the Association of Managers: information technologies, commercial banks, forest and forestry industry, machinery, media, metallurgy, multi-professional holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications, consumer services, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceutical, energy, and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a login and password for access to www.top1000.amr.ru where they see information about other participants and can submit their evaluations on the basis of the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
Based on the rating building methodology, the principle of "Best Choices": Top Managers appreciate top managers, functional managers appreciate functional managers.
Such a principle would allow for the maximum authentic assessment of the professional reputation of a colleague.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year's rating and many candidates for the previous year are invited to attend the expert commissions ' open meetings.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission on the approval of the list of senior managers and eight functional commissions.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly in accordance with the internet assessment and are closed before the publication of the rating) or to update them in accordance with the list of available reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules and rules of the Russian language.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies can be made.
Comfort rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April of the current year was 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Following the panic over the end of 2014, the amount of GBS loans declined significantly in 2015.
The reason is understandable: rapid increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from funding under 25-30 per cent of the years.
If an earlier bank could raise all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it is not possible to do so now: rates and so on.
For business, the current level of MBS credit rates is unencumbered.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their acquisition.
The rate level of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive income.
How much do you estimate is the demand for credit holders?
After the decrease in the percentage rate of the CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have been treated with a lot of credit.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one output: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and region.
More attention should be paid to the current results and control the movement of funds.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernise equipment, reduce production costs and energy security.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to make production more competitive and to keep business even in an unstable economic situation.
What key trends in the SME credit market will be strengthened and will impact its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The average rate reduction forecast will depend much on the central bank's policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, there is no need to expect a radical decline in the price of credit for SMEs.
In the current situation, first of all, inflation is an increase in the percentage required to obtain real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the rates of CB decline.
In terms of the threshold level, traditional small and medium-sized enterprises that are limited both in terms of cash supply and in terms of economic behaviour adjustments will, of course, pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, lacquery and at the same time difficult enough for those who are accustomed to kirillic or Latin.
As well as the new crossover CX-5, such as, of course, any other model of the brand: without any ambiguity, technically completed inside.
Japan has just been able to bring its "Japan" into line with the products of the Eastern Sun to its full state.
How appropriate that arguments be made for the use of cars from other countries, and the person even agrees in principle with these arguments, but the whole sentence comes from the final phrase: "But this is the same Japanese car!
And don't argue about anything!
Such people must probably love not only the technique but also the Japanese.
To quote from the base, to prepare a massage, collect cats and dress your marriage, not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashions: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Please, Japan's school form is the only form that girls have with satisfaction and after school.
It has amazing properties: simultaneously and sensitive, and strong.
And the older the older the older, the nice step.
The main change in external CX-5 is a five-horizontal radar grid.
But where the shape of the car is more powerfully changed by a new paint and background, the car is currently known in the flow of the car.
As in the past, Mazda CX-5 looks very convenient.
Siluet is harmonious, shapes are sensitive, but its externality is strict.
There's no need to call the police.
According to the CX-5 role, one of the most secure in the world, only permanent Japanese peace can be tested.
The diesel engine of 2.2 l provides a high speed time in a wide range of speeds.
At this cost, the engine's fuel consumption of 175 C. - all 5.9 L. is compiled by a strong aggregate exclusively automatic transmission and full input.
Black boots, black money, black bag...
To add a little black hole in this picture, you can select the logos with a print from the Not Cross police.
However, in Mazda you have made maximum efforts to prevent you from being on your own DTP.
In order to further enhance comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, they redesigned the construction of front and rear amortizers and optimised the form of front-hand plugs.
The system of full introduction is adapted under Russian conditions.
The level of noise from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A buyer in a flower or basket is as expensive as a budget seat.
It's another case if a girl hangs in a buyer with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter's genre.
Her attention will then be drawn to no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 improved construction of both front and rear seats, which provides optimal space storage and for large plates, and for long legs, who has what it has.
The longer it is estimated that the pressure in the front of the central tunnel is now mild and does not be on board.
The largest set of active security systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
To identify the potential danger, radar, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is also a suitable lighting, a warning of a collision, a monitoring of dead zones, and a safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best luggage in the class.
It shall contain at least 561 p.m. The rear seats shall be in proportion to 4:2:4 p.m. - each section shall be supplied with a separate output box - and shall increase the baggage segment by 1560 p.m.
Hero multifilm costumes in Japan are called "cygurus."
It's particularly sensitive to the shape of the monkeys.
She's got everything!
Of course you're asleep.
But it's still fun for young children.
Or just to blow up such a beast on the street...
Well, that's so good when it's possible to choose a dress, a behavior or a car.
Thank you for helping prepare Kawaicat's material.
Kiev destroyed the atomic union.
Kiev officially rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the supply of Herculinic AES.
The Supreme Council, in the middle of its second attempt, has still voted for a breach of the agreement with Moscow.
The third and fourth blockage agreements were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was not yet implemented.
In the middle of the Supreme Council, Ukraine adopted a law disseminating the agreement between 2010 and 2012 with the IMF on the construction of a third and fourth block of the AEE.
The draft legislation introduced by the Government was passed only by a second vote, for the first time by 210 Members at the required minimum at 226, but then by 234 Members of Parliament at the time of the draft vote.
The CSSR Hmelnice AEC on a specific project should have counted four GVT cells with VEER reactors, but only two could be built.
The accession negotiations with Moscow led to the conclusion of an Intergovernmental Agreement in 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was expected that the blockade would be awarded to the Russian side, but the funds would not be allocated.
After the conversion to Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent freeze in relation to the two countries of Kiev began to develop relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the Hemmelnic AEC and on the project to build a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations were maintained was the remaining RF fuel purchases for active Ukrainian AECs (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as long as the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoat" replaces Russian supplies with something.
The Hmelnicko AEC delivery plans with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been rejected: negotiations with Czech Skoda JS were still under way in Kiev in 2014.
The United Nations has opposed the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
At the press conference, UN Secretary-General Pan Ghi Mun reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"No military solution," the AP replied to the question of Syria ' s military support from Russia.
Mr. Gi Mun also reported that he would hold a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of UN Security Council permanent members on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the IUDs of the United Nations permanent members of the UN at the latest this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Previously today, Vice-President of the Russian Federation, Nicolai Bodnanovski, told him that Genthab was not excluded from the possibility of establishing a future WWS base in Syria.
There's no such plan.
"But it can be anything," said Mr. Godanowski.
Former U.S. reported that the United States did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was needed to combat the terrorist group banned in the RF.
For more information on the United States of America's concerns about Russian aid in Syria, see the article "E" "The Russian military presence in Syria is worried about Washington".
The OSCE reports on a possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-eastern part of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," said Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and "to return to the normal life of our countries".
In his view, it was possible for the current dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the "Normandian format" or in the form of a contact group on the OBSE field, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, according to politics, all forms of dialogue are supported in Kiev.
The former representative of Ukraine, ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Danish and Luganese Republic had not largely changed its position on the triangular negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties gave orders.
Yesterday, the Lower New York Electoral Commission had resulted in elections in the municipal area by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were caused by the representatives of the CPRF who accused the election of “infection of counterfeits”.
The comments of the opposition were not adopted.
The following election was rejected by the Communist Party of Russia in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of payments for the Capremont of Multi-Square Houses.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the mountains of the Netherlands New York City on the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1,03 million people were included in the list of voters in New York City, 746.7 thousand were issued for voting in the local commissions and 268 thousand were voted for.
More than 11.7,000 booklets and 24 lost were identified as inactive.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties depending on the votes they had received.
Six seats in the mountain are listed by "One Russia" for Dmitria Suatkov, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasiliu Supranov, Elizavete Solonchenko, Vacceslav Rasterieev and Igor Nagorna.
The only mandate of the LDPR was the leader of Vladimir Girinowski's party.
The two mandates of the CPRF are divided between Vladimir Bulan and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev's MP.
Three "Justice of Russia" mandates are available to Alexander the Great, Igor Goddan and Mikhail Shaulugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will work as citizens in the city: if they refuse the mandate, they will move to the next candidate on the list.
The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Alexander Maceev, informed members of the Commission that he was introducing deserts for "the sending of the telegram to Girinov and others" for the purpose of rejecting the mandates.
In adopting the protocol on the outcome of the CPRF elections, the representatives of the CPR stated numerous violations.
A member of the Gorisbircoma with the right to a meeting vote from CPRF Leonid Krasnokutski proposed that the results of the vote should not be recognized in the four districts No.21-24, bearing in mind that the headquarters of the administration of the Sormo region was closed to the building of the administration where four circuit commissions were available.
Within a long time, neither the MPs of the House of Commons, nor the very candidates, nor the observers, could go through, and the rational scandal with the noise of the radio department's doors was shown in the telefer.
All observers and members of the commissions had the opportunity to attend meetings with the right to a meeting.
Their head ceased access only when the vote was completed and local commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"After the head was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," said a member of the top voter, Natalie Andrušin.
The communists argued that in the blockade of the administration, more than four hours had been unlawfully detained by the MP of the Human Aristov Congregation for the purpose of making a statement to the Research Committee.
The opposition also complained that on the day of the election, a number of WICOs began to print urine at 6-7 in the morning, placing them on the ballot cards for a temporary vote.
The members of the commissions, with the right to vote and observers, had not been informed, so they had arrived at the beginning of the elections by 8 a.m.
The communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations in the urine, ballots could be uncontrollable.
However, in the election that has already considered more than 124 complaints for various reasons, Alexander Maceeva said that he has not found any violations of unaccompanied ballots.
The members of the Commission did not support the proposal of their colleague, "Justice Russia" Maria Popove, through an effort to come out with amendments to regional legislation, so as to clearly establish time for the inclusion of ballot cards that then fall into the urine.
"In your own initiative, talk even to the CIC," said Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samakhin, complained that the election had ignored dozens of complaints and had been mistaken in the election.
"You're not here for questioning, be careful!" said the president of the election.
The Protocol was therefore approved almost unanimously.
The general results of the elections should be approved by 27 September, followed by the first three weeks of the first city meeting of the New York Sixth Assembly.
In addition to the definition of the results of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party of the Russian Communist Party in the registration of an initiative group to conduct a local referendum.
On the basis of the documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues: whether they agree with the fact that meetings for the roof of multi-square homes should be "cut off immediately" and the rates for housing-communal services "dwelling by 2020".
However, lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the treatment of "Russian Communists" was contrary to legislation.
FedEx has a mixed character, a decrease in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported the unsatisfied results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the annual income forecast due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increase in costs in its unit of land transport.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 per cent on the provisional market in 45 minutes before the opening of the medium course.
FedEx Corp. stated that it was planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ended in May next year, less than 20 cents in the previous forecast.
The analysts proposed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
Despite an increase in the average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, the decrease in the forecast is observed and the increase in land transport charges for heavy or abrasive goods, which begin in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase interest rates compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely with the weak, relative to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The plans to hire labour force at holidays were announced on the following day after the contestant, UPS, that they planned to hire additional 95 000 staff, about as much as they had taken up work last year.
For a quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income amounted to $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 for the share carried out by Zacks Investment Research by 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5 per cent, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a decline in the sector of long-term international transport, which has led to a lack of growth in gross income in its unit of express transport.
However, the boom of online purchases has greatly improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport has increased by 29 per cent, but operating income has remained largely unchanged due to high costs for major travel and self-insurance.
The unit of express transport received higher income due to higher basic rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to higher labour costs.
In the provisional markets, about $150.15 per cent of FedEx's share price fell to approximately $3.85 per cent or 2.5 per cent.
They closed on Tuesday, fell 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent lower records since 11 June.
At the most expected meeting of the Heads of the Federal Reserve System for a few years, two days this week will be held at a 27-foot table from the Honduran green tree, deciding whether to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At the same time, the United States will have a very well-established meeting room in two stages.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the country's economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received two orders from the Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the Heads of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in almost a forecasted decision that will be announced on Thursday whether the United States economy is ready to move out of the unprecedented incentive that has been providing almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even when most data show reliable economic growth, recent financial market shocks can also be kept by the federal system ' s careful leaders to increase volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even at the fourth percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Peggs, chief economist of the Brooklyn company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"Then I think that if they were to seek a reason not to raise rates that would increase uncertainty around the world enough to give them further justification," she noted.
There is no consensus as to what is done in the Federal Reserve System, which itself causes financial market collapse.
About half of the economists recently questioned Bloomberg predicted an increase in the percentage rate this week.
Financial markets, however, are expected to maintain the federal system, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the risk of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a downturn of the share market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not slow down the promise that the next increase will soon be.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Johns index rose to 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
It was hoped that people who defined the federal system's strategy would leave the rate this week, said John Londonski, the lead economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system increases rates at this time," he noted.
If this is the case, "they will have to go far into adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they will not panic."
Other experts argued that the increase in the rate could calm financial markets, as this would create uncertainty about how the federal system would work.
A month ago, the Federal system was expected to raise the rate of 0.25 per cent this month by taking the first small step in slowing down financial conditions, which could confirm the validity of the recovery of the United States.
Yellen stated early in the summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the Liberal complaint that there was a need for greater economic progress.
Although new jobs were delayed in August, the growth in the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment has decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest rate of more than seven years, almost at the level that the federal system considers to be full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the target central bank of the annual indicator at 2 per cent, the federal system ' s leadership stated that it was a key factor in the temporary decline in oil prices.
The economy "can also be managed at higher rates and needs them, taking into account the decline in the labour market," noted Ian Shelfardson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world became three thirds at the end of last month, after China had invested its currency.
The Dou-Johns ' average index for industrial companies ' shares fell to 16 per cent on record high value in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could hamper world growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent of the highest value.
For the guidance of the Federal Reserve System, market recovery is further difficult to calculate when interest rate increases.
"In the absence of information on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been closing the doors at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve System Officer.
Now, according to his estimates, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty about what consequences may have for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the last events in China,” said Olyner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the federal system, and it should not be taken into account in the decision-making process.
However, the federal reserve system has become the world financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the federal reserve system could "close" its financial expansion has caused market disturbances worldwide.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly interfering with each other, it could be expected that the Heads of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process was “faster than science”, noted Zakari Karabelle, director of Investnet Inc, a company dealing with global governance strategies.
Jeffery Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System there have been cases of excessive response to the movement of the financial market which appear to be not linked to economic principles".
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, for example, drew decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to a fall in the federal system at 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "in spite of limited identified effects on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
Following the fall of the federal system leaders, these cuts were lifted.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only during major crises, such as market abuse in 2008,” said Adam C. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England Committee on Percentage Deficiency.
The last panic and almost never approached this level, he said.
"You would, of course, not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of growing rates because the markets are under stress," Pozen, president of their World Economic Institute, said Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not think they should be affected until this changes.

Mr. Sergey Narishkin, Spicer, admits that the United States is aimed at destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that refugees can flee to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulan Bator during the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's annual session.
"I am not a party to conspireological theories, but I ask myself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"A believer has assumed and knew that the flow of refugees, these unfortunate and displaced people who are rescued from death will be stopped in the EU's beneficiary countries," he added.
Narishkin asked: "Did many European political leaders openly express themselves about the causes of this crisis, this concern for refugees, which is now literally affecting their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to remain silent," he noted.
According to Narachkin, NATO is in favour of many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has been looking for a long and unpredictably long period of time and looks at how the military soap, which is based on NATO standards, is also exhilarating moral ideals and basic principles and norms of international law,” he stressed.
Government forces and their loyal military formations are opposed by mercenaries who are mainly Islamists.
Later, a terrorist group banned in Russia by the Islamic State was joined by the Syrian Government ' s opponents.
The United States dollars are supported by rebels who are against Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called for the illegal West to Russia.
The claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact based on their being sovereign States.
This was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Barar Assad in an interview between RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Asada, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to pick up one person and place another in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his family.
Assad drew attention to the rapid development of Western media with the beginning of the transformation in Ukraine.
In his statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from the other West into an enemy, a king, a dictator, who has voiced the Russian opposition that has come to power in a non-democratic manner, despite having been elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin called on the world community to join Assad to fight against the “Islamic State”.
Commenting on the Permanent Statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President would come to the people ' s consent through the elections and, if so, at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the President will stay, and if he does not, he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly and reminded them of their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with its neighbor Iraq.
With regard to military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that it supported the Syrian State in politics, economic and military matters.
He challenged the claim that Iranian military units are being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's giving us a war technique.
"Of course, there is room for exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them when there is a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of a so-called anti-terrorist and anti-terrorist coalition known as the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths has risen to over 230 thousand, the number of refugees of 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was occupied by a terrorist group called the Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
The International Coalition in the head of the United States is airborne by IG positions.

Reuters reported on this with reference to the representative of the Department of the John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the debate was a conflict in Syria.

Borodha called the American newspaper a curse on Strelkova.
The former president of the Government of the declared Dominican People ' s Republic, Alexander Borodha, questioned the information published in The Washington Post, U.S.A.
He said this in a telephone interview with the Lenti.ru correspondent.
The observation at Washington Post is beautiful that everything's completely turned out there.
The former Minister for the Defence of DNA Igorya Strelkova, of course, did not connect him and he “went out” from the territory of the Republic of Donbassa in a very modest manner, without any credit, without the three forums assigned to him by various personnel,” he noted.
According to Bordoya, the issue of Ströllko in the interview with the reporter of the American newspaper was indeed gone.
"Yes, I said that Ströllkova had to be removed from the territory of the People's Republic of Denmark immediately," said the former head of the Government of the DDR.
Bordeaux stressed that he did not know why the US edition correspondent decided to write that Strallkov was exported to Russia ' s "related" territory.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's a strangely misunderstood word, because I stressed that the Arrows are gone by themselves," noted Borodya.
"That's the key to me and to Strelkova," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post, an article in which Bordoya’s words about his forced export of Strellkova to the territory of Russia appeared.
According to the issue, Borodya noted that he had to contact his partner.
The Polish authorities started looking for a trip with the gold Nazis.
The Polish foresters began to cut down trees on a underground tunnel where, according to some data, they traveled with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rail hearings with debris.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals on the inside.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Defence Forces Thomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that new evidence of the existence of a gold voyage was no longer convincing.
However, the authorities decided to seize the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Juhowski, said that local tenants had found the same trip with the gold of the Third Reich, mentioned in the legends.
Juhowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were discovered, they would be owned by the State but would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbji, reporting that they had found a trip in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The principal druglogist of the RF proposed that smoking be prohibited until 21 years of age.
Russia ' s leading drug dealer proposed that tobacco be banned until 21 years of age.
Eugenia Brown noted that "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - has been particularly harmful to this age".
So he said in the live ephemeral of the "Gourit Moscow" radio station, commenting on the fact that Spicer Softeda Valentina Matvienko had supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens at the age of 21.
Man's making a mess.
It's possible to serve in the army for 18 years, physically prepared for this.
He has been mentally prepared for a full life in society since he was 21.
"Of course from scientific data, the brain, its biochemistry, is finally starting at 21 years of age," Brown noted.
Former member of the General Chamber and project leader Sultan Hamzaev reported "Investment", that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age of alcohol sales and "has agreed with the General Chamber to raise this issue again at the top of the House of Parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federal Council for the drafting of a bill under the direction of Matthewenko.
The Bible has been requested to verify compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
Mr. Novosibirska called at the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible under the federal law on the protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development, with a statement dated 16 September, by the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the appeal stated that on 26 August 2015, he obtained a copy of the Bible in the Chinese City magazine of the Red Cross, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "To protect children from information that is harmful to their health and development".
The statement was adopted on 16 September to consider the city of Novosibirska.
The response to the treatment of the inhabitants of Novosibirska will take place within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, commented the complainant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, this is a fundamental problem that will divide society.
He will start to read the Bible as never before.
The Brazilian Federation of Pediatrics of Rio Grande promotes healthy food for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization of the SPRS has developed a scandalous approach to convince women of the need for adequate food during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of young people with breast cancer, which are described as harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all the nutrients they need in order to form a strong immune system.
With regard to the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased to about 500 calories per cent.
However, recent studies show that one rise in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of health at Bellor's College in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents their development.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of malnutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg a bus passed through the school.
Near Hamburg, the trip took place on a school bus that stopped on the road.
The 23-year-old driving woman, who realized that she could not get off the train, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a stroke on their eyes.
On the video one of the schoolchildren set it up.
Because of the emergency situation among the students, panic struck.
Some children started crying and running around.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger who had suffered a slight injury.
The damage to the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The guidance of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Browna-young.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown ended up in a trauma with the Philippinesinteger Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the defeat of Magali in the 12th round.
Brown fell into a brain trauma hospital.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was involved in a life insurance device.
At the professional race, Brown won 22 winnings, he suffered both defeats and one battle ended last night.
He's got two kids left.
This has already been the second case of a flight between Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March of the trauma of the race, 23-year-old Bridon Smith graduated.
AMA now recommends not to take this kind of sport, but rather, from its point of view, to prohibit it at all.
I understand that this is not going to happen, said Vice-President Steven Pernis.
But as there is now a box, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain injury that causes or causes death or serious injury.
That's why AMA thinks we can't keep living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure combining practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narachkin called on the OSCE to abolish sanctions against the IMF parliamentarians.
Mr. Gosdoma RF Sergei Narachkin called for the unlawful introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In this connection, he made a statement at the session of the OSCE in Ulan Bator.
We appreciate this as unacceptable actions, such as the entry into the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," policy said.
In addition, Narshkin called on the OSCE participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get back to politics.
Let us return to dialogue and the right to practice international community.
Let's get back humanitarian ideas in the democratic peace order.
"Doubling was never done well," he said.
In a speech from the Court of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian Gosdom called on parliamentarians to convene an Inter-Parliamentary Contact Group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to allow the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our Inter-Parliamentary Group," Narachkin said.
He also noted that it was necessary to assign the appropriate OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalise the situation in Ukraine," policy stressed.
It was recalled that the session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan Bator and will be extended until 18 September.
He's been enjoying a couple of days.
The World Championship for Easy Athletes Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old lightball from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
It has managed to win a total of 110 metres from its root distance with barrierers at Europe's command, to set up several records, and to become the world's champion, the first in the history of the populace.
In addition, a sportsman has recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking a third place in general.
The New Investions asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergey, is your season not over yet?
Yes, I'm going to talk about World War Games that will take place in October in Korea and then I'll think about it.
It's true, I'm going to be home in Barnaul now, and being home is quite different.
It's easier than to fight for peace every week.
You're like you said the autumn is a favorite time of year for you.
By the end of August, early September is a wonderful time.
After the main start of the season, the burden of responsibility is gone.
You can be satisfied with the "failure".
Plus, you know, it's about time for a break.
What about resistance?
However, the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The stability to the end of the season is always complicated.
And it doesn't matter what he did more-- he won or won.
Every conversation is a stress.
Permanent flights, flights, all of them don't happen to the organism.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I've got feelings, of course, on my mind.
Yeah, I'm just happy there!
When you're finished at the Peace Championships in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's going to be.
Yeah, you reporters, don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the bad sportsman who lives in the old wins is driving his successful escapes again and again.
He's been enjoying a couple of days, and he's got to move on.
Was the preparation for this remarkable season quite different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We were ready to start in December, but I missed the winter season.
He started home in Barnabas, then to the congregations, then to the house again.
It's all normal.
But the trainer was assigned the task of trying to get out of the new level I had not yet been.
Almost all winter time is spent on setting up a base.
They ran out of cross dogs, practiced general physical training that included weight, presence, and back.
Then they took the barbaric training, and they worked very hard.
How did the opponents respond, followed?
I'm always trying to do this, well, there's nothing wrong with the Internet.
He saw a winter European champion, and there, in a barbaric spring, all five of them took French!
I thought I needed to do something to enjoy this company.
With every start in this season you acquired and acquired results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons in the same scheme.
It's not like I ran into 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always twist my shape gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is avoid 13 seconds.
All the work has been aimed primarily at this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to move and you're not always ready to show your willingness.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, if it's true, that semi-final escape (Shubenkov couldn't get to the end. "NY") tried to forget right away.
Ready was really good, I could really get out of 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best result at the moment, it would be a bronze example of Game.
But it didn't.
Remember your first world champion?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get to the end, that's the maximum program.
And he got off the front of the morning, in the early runaways.
Then he realized that cutting and carrying his head would mean never to escape.
Two years later, at the World Championship in Moscow, he's already gone to the end with a better time.
How I remember my feelings before the decisive escape: I wanted to win the gold!
How is it possible to avoid losing one’s mind by developing a relatively fast pace?
And that's the most difficult thing to do.
You need to be very accurate, focused on technology so you don't want to lose your barriers.
He noticed that when you worry about the results, it's much easier for the process.
And the worst thing when you're feeling like you're running away, and it's all getting yourself!
A honest word, it's worth it.
Many of our deep - rooted athletes are trying to move closer to the capital after the first major successes.
Didn't you ever think that way?
The house's still getting better.
I don't even know where I'm without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe, and it would be good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C. You've been together for a long time?
When he was 12 years old, since he came into the light attic.
In fact, I started training his wife, who worked with the children, and then she already handed me over.
I started out with the spring, then in the distance, three times.
The children's majority were when the sword was blown, they came from a distance...
At 14, he tried to run with the barriers, and I enjoyed it.
From the first escape, it was possible to implement the second adult standard.
That's what's left of it.
There was no fear in front of the barriers?
Sometime I got to deal with them.
But there was always a lot to do about the technique.
How much he suffered over a single sentence!
But it's never going to happen from this routine.
The technique has to be turned off all the time - so I can wake up at night, I'll get up right away and run through the bars.
Everyone who saw your escape in Beijing says it was a very beautiful escape.
Thank you.
I enjoyed it myself.
I usually don't look at my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But there are no limitations on efficiency.
Don't you be afraid now that winning a year before the Olympic Games is on the shoulders of a heavy cargo?
As they say in such cases, I try to be reasonable.
Once you've chosen this road, it means you've got to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: If you're not weak, no additional burden should be felt.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not so jealous that I'm surprised at the reaction to an interview in Ukraine.
People are upset, I understand, their bread isn't bread.
And although I wasn't involved with the flag, at the same time, millions of times I spoke here, and I didn't call anyone directly, I did.
All my psychotic friends got involved in a second where they got divorced.
The pressure I'm facing is so strong that even I look like a couple, I think people are tired.
It's gonna be fun, it's fun, it's crazy, it's got a crowd on you, and it's not gonna bother you.
But you need to know me, I'm not a roomy eagle, I'm a doll, I'm a goubic, I'm old, I'm afraid.
Another case is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
The best thing I've ever had was self-sufficient, so enjoy it.
And giving passports to tools like Fred Derst or Monson can only be made by hand.
I'd better have a better journalist work out of my mind.
Last week in Kiev, Otar Kushanašvili briefly described the cream events:
What they did with the Crimea is the Crime.
That's what they call anaesthesia.
I believe that the reference to the undercrowded Cross has been trying to sign something, which is never included in the general picture of human society.
It's like coming to the neighborhood and taking his living room...
The war from Cremla is gone, and it's only going to end there.
I am almost 100% convinced that, as in 2008, it began with a call from some kind of sight from the Kremlin.
I have a guess who that might be...
Cobzon isn't so much alive anymore.
I don't understand why he's the greatest artist he needs to cut Putin's hands.
What, he's losing his apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And peace now depends only on Vladimira Vladimirovica.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite the attempts of the Nine to light up the losing of leaders in Today Show
The withdrawal of Carla Stefanovic and Liz Wilkinson in Canberra to clarify the impact of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's position has not been able to raise the rating today.
The morning show of the 9th was broadcast from the capital of the State after the explosion of Malcolm Ternbull by Tony Ebbot.
The Sunrise competition, led by David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, has been held in London in the weekly series of international awareness, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture seems to have little meaning for Australian TV operators, while Sunrise's audition had 397,000 viewers in five largest cities compared to today's audience at 339,000.
Today has taken a little more than its rate on Monday (317 000) and on Tuesday (283 000), but its figure has been lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today's break with Sunrise in the last months.
In August Today there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 divisions.
By September Sunrise had 349 000 views against 314,000 today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine. Thank you for explaining.
Today was published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the striking debate on 800 Words from the former star series Packed to the Raffers Eric Thompson.
The new drama on the recent home - father family, which decided to move to New Zealand along with its two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million.
Critics argued whether Tomson could handle a popular show alone without the stars Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a big answer to yes.
The X Factor VII remained in strong positions with 1,136 million audiences, easy access to The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the seventh, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) was a new television set by Andrew O'Kifi, where 446,000 viewers were gathered.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) drew to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuar. (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators and the second half of the 720,000 spectators.
Hot Seat gathered 620,000.
The decline in Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the ninth to admit that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the exchange of millions of dollars minute that couldn't play McGuyra show.

Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is an ideal guy, but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jevon-Fellouz, Sara McCay and Snow Markosski may have given you an opportunity to see who wins at Holostaka.
A woman who finally stays Sam Wood in Holostaike is surrounded by a mystery.
And the three who came up to the girl's end, of course, are keeping the secret of who's the last of them.
But when we met Sarah Mackey, Snow Markski, and Lana Jeffons-Fellow, the day the three girls were supposed to be two, they might have suddenly given a hint as to the winner.
Sam Wood kept quiet until the end of the fourth.
All three women come in a lirelike mood, explaining why Wood is an ideal man who remembers his sense of honor, ambition, family values, viability as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his satellite.
But in their answers to the question, "If you don't, who should be the last rose of the Wood?" they could readily identify which of them really touched the heart of the "Holostika".
Jeffons-Fellow and Marcoski no doubt named Mackey the ideal pair for Wood.
The first day of Sarah’s life, there was good relations between her and Sam.
"From the moment I was in attendance, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and realized that they were very kind to each other, and during the entire show there was no doubt about it," said Jeeves-Fellow.
"Sara is a very open man, easy and fun with her," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really tension between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackey thinks that Sam Wood and Sam will get a good pair.
Mikey himself said that because of the house witness last week, she realized that Wood might be "the same person".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
The question of who should choose Wood if it is not her, she answered with a nod.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow and Lana deserve it at the same time.
Show The Bachelor is on Wednesday at 19.30 on Ten.
It was originally published under the name "Sara - the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Gerard Heine had several options to start a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested after his move to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent applications after an impressive open day of training last year.
But Hein picked San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula, and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Heina on the back of the game for the rest of the game for the lost sword, which the former Australian League of Regiba had allowed for the first round of the Panta in the winning game with the Minnesot.
But Tomsula believed in his game and gave Hena another chance to get back a pen, as well as to work him in the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula showed himself on the right side and then after the game, in the divisor.
Instead of creating a distinction between the news in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Heina at the post-mortem press conference.
The Special Rapporteur of the 49s Cam Inman Club reported that Hein had also received support from the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost sword and think about the next game.
Jared Hein lost his sword at the back of the Minnesot Wickings team at the first quarter.
At the beginning of the debate in NHL Hein and its numerous Australian worshipers were apparently not counting.
It was seen as Hein ran off the field after losing his sword, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not present himself with a more unsuccessful career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hein.
Hein compared his speech with a debater in the original game series in 2007, when a bullet blast in his home area led to the test of Queensland.
As a result, this experience has proved very useful for the 27-year-old game.
Hein photographed the Australian flag and fans after the game and presented photos in Instagram.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of gays
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at the risk of using weapons at Siberian airport.
Openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkski was convicted, his oil company "Yukos" was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
On the border of Hungary, contact with the police has been made with migrants.
Refugees filed protests at Serbia's border near the Hungarian people's Resca, who had grown up in contact with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police have been using hydrogen and exhaust gas, transferring Reuters.
The migrants are killing police stones and are trying to catch up with the prison border.
In response to aggressive acts by migrants and their attempts to break the border, police are aimed at providing support.
According to the Agency France-Presse, refugees were able to escape through police lines, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Venger border on their buses to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports Bi-Bi-Si.
The authorities have allowed migrants to arrive in Croatia and to ensure that they are transported from there to the country where they are needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament passed legislation on migration and border protection.
Amendments include the participation of the military in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for considering asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one immigrant as guilty of the illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serb border, which will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament is also planning to consider the issue of the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces on the protection of the country's borders.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a road bridge 175 km along the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The largest in the history of the U.S. cyberattack was recognized by Russians.
The largest in the history of the United States cyberattack, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to over 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court, New Jersey Drinkman agreed to a deal with the aim of obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
At the meeting, Russian spoke on a deal with three Russian citizens and Ukrainian citizens who were accused of cyberattacks by 15 companies.
The total damage to the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman was threatened with 30 years of imprisonment, as well as with a fine of $ million.
The court will take into account the recognition of Russia and may reduce the time limit.
Drinkman's sentence shall be announced on 15 January.
Vladimira Drinkmana was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitri Smilánez, was taken to prison.
He rejects his last guilt in his crimes committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk in support of the Russian Barara Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian media, Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary John Kerry, warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Barazar Asada was furthering the conflict in the country.
"Secret Kerry has shown that Russia's support for President Asada is at risk of deepening and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on seeking a solution to the conflict in Syria with the help of an effective political transition," says a report published on the U.S. Department website.
Kerry confirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the “Islamic State” group (activities prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary, Assad “can never be a trusted member” of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
The arrest of the press secretary of the White House of Joshua Ernest threatened Russia's isolation if he did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition, which carried out an anti-terrorist operation against the “Islamic State”.
In recent times the media have often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian MID Sergey Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped the Syrians acquire technology to use it against Islamists.
Four deaths were reported when the police discovered the shooting of rifles on protestors in Nepal.
Four men, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting at the firing squad in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said in the middle.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandaya district, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
Basno Prassad Dhakal, the head of the local police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters were gathered in one of the police offices, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had been using explosive gas and then shot in the air before they were fired.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why retinal bullets, which, of course, can be killed, but they are traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, have caused such high mortality.
This meeting was the last few weeks of intense protests in the southern part of Nepal, where the representatives of the Madesi people said that the new provinces of the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
The protests also reached the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in brutal attacks, starting with 10
On August, when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, it was a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that led to thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft Constitution in Katmandu this week, and the officials stated that the new chapter would be signed.
Sayansk plans to create a business at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest town in the area of Irkutsk.
It was seen in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with a development of infrastructure requiring system support.
Last year Sayansk led a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
With regard to the results of the first year of work, he told the Correspondent of the Area on new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valerievic, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I was familiar with the results of audits of financial and economic activities and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
A municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been the reduction of documentation by five days.
Previously on Institutes had been able to walk for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and to optimise expenditure.
In November last year, a meeting of the Government was held in Sayanska, where issues of socio-economic development were considered.
The city had no project-accounting documentation (PSD) on any facility.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started training on roads, children's garden, North Canal Collection and Water.
Road work in two areas is now underway.
How is the country implemented by the President of the RF for the construction of children's gardens?
In July this year 105 children were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of security in children ' s homes today is one of the most relevant.
Since 1 September, children's capital repair No. 10, calculated at 320 locations, has been closed.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
He never received such funds.
In the past year, following the repair, the children’s garden No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children, was opened.
The repairs were made under the terms of funding from the regional and local budgets, which cost more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, furniture and equipment were sought, assistance and the “National Initiatives” programme.
There are plans to start building a new child garden in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children from the age of three years.
We don't have time for children from three to seven years.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be done, above all, by the Sayan companies, i.e. they must be provided with work.
A 60-quarter-room house for orphanages in the Leningrad micro-area is already under operation in October.
With regard to construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Prianggarya, which has entered the economic class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 blocks will begin in the near future.
We have all declared the construction of 10 billion inhabitants who wish to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions for housing should not be less than 30 thousand rubles per square metre, which includes the "key" section.
If we deal with the amounts involved, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
In its territory, Sayan swine complex was built, which was sold in 2004.
We're working with the Procurator for this deal.
More than the land under the property is in federal property.
Working with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 ha to the regional property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to restructure and launch project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the pig complex, we're going to have 900 jobs, which will become a great support for the city.
In Sayansk, the Institute of Social Partnership?
We have 140 social and economic partnerships.
Few projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Sensible support is provided to enterprises such as the Vostok Centre, the New South TEC, OO Sayanski Broller, OOC MDF, the leadership of these companies is rejected for all treatment.
Just before the OOO City Day of Sayanski Broller hit the city of the child city, the West Centre had been remodeled by a horse court, where children were treated with hypathy, costing more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorships, the territory of the city of Zagsa was well established.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s Day.
As in the old good times, there was a meeting with city councils and organizations.
The city was released, the book of Sayan poets.
Early construction workers and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska have been given jubilee medals.
Mecenances are also involved in the work of the urban welfare fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months more than 800 thousand rubles were directed to support talented children, helping children in need of expensive treatment to support children from small-scale families.
How are social problems solved in Sayansk?
There's no doctors and pedagogists in town.
The provision of housing specialists is of great importance in the decision-making process.
In the past year, we had five rooms for the doctors, and four bedrooms were provided.
We are working on a housing allocation programme with the possibility of privatizing it within five years.
Plans are the replanning of the building, with eight additional bedrooms for the pedagogues.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the "Gile for the Russian Family" programme.
In the context of the construction of a house for budgetary workers.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city that I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential in Sayanska and our region was large.
The Duma introduced a draft law on the indexing of savings taking into account the increase in prices.
A bill was introduced in the House to index social pensions from 1 February each year, taking into account price growth.
The author of the document, a member of the “Justice of Russia” Alexander Lomakin-Romance, also proposes an additional index of pensions on 1 April if the rate of growth of the livelihood exceeds the rate of growth in goods and services.
The index of pensions, under current legislation, is produced from 1 April each year, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner's living minimum in the IMF last year.
The draft law introduced in the lower room provides for the indexing of social pensions, taking into account the pace of growth in consumer prices.
The first index shall be carried out on 1 February and the second shall be held on 1 April.
The Head of the OSCE has declared Mogerini not to be allowed to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union on Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini Spicer PA OBSE Ilkka Canerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the activities of the Assembly would not be allowed.
The journalists were informed by a member of the Russian delegation at the opening session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator, Nicolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, with support from the position of Canerva, European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were gathered.
"There has already been enough support," Kovalev said.
He stated earlier that the Head of the OSCE had spoken with a view to gathering the signatures of Members who indicated that they were not allowed to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev said that Canerva had promised to raise this problem at the level of the EU's leading structures and to "send the relevant petition".
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone to the south of the Red Sea is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low-pressure area is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Green Sea is likely to be 60 per cent in the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday at the National Centre for hurricanes of the United States.
Another well-defined low-pressure area, approximately between the Green Moss and the Little Anthyl Islands, is also 60 per cent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports the Mayian synoptics.
Google is launching a double-rate campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a resurgence campaign for 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations assisting European refugees from war-distributed and united countries.
Google has used a non-characterized personal approach by announcing the collection of donations in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, who had fled from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on suspicious trips and buses, endured hunger, famine, cold and fear," she wrote.
I got it.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Victims will be transferred to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugee and migrant assistance: "The Returns Without Borders", the International Committee for the Rescue, the Organization of the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on Google.com/refugeelief would reach $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest crisis with refugees since World War II, which has resulted in most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people over this year.
Many are also fleeing the armed conflicts of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low light may help with radiation surgery
The beneficial effect of post-life surgery on people with mild type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetes with small bleedings live longer than those with non-serious surgery.
"The statistics of death are not immediately shown," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on radiation surgery, who wrote about a new study in JAMA Surgery column.
The urinary surgeon, or bariarthritis surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to eat.
For several years, bariarthritis has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphine clearance with body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, a relatively growth weight measure, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that man has a excess weight, and people with IMT over 30 are considered to be light people.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Hotel Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariarthritis surgery with iron and gistrectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with minor light.
The average value of IMTs in those who underwent surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains approximately 29.
Of those who transferred the operation, 36 per cent had been completely cured from diabetes and 28 per cent.
In the group receiving medical treatment, there was only 1 per cent complete treatment of diabetes and only about 2 per cent partial treatment.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LPNP cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group," authors say.
Researchers have also controlled blood haemoglobin levels of A1s that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
The haemoglobin A1c is better maintained by less than 7%, says researchers.
Following surgical intervention, the average haemoglobin of A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8 per cent.
However, the best glycaemic control indicators reflected by the good levels of the A1c haemoglobin have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and his colleague.
The study group also compared the mean results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group receiving manual gastrics, the group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), increased IMT (at 7.4 versus 5.1 kg) and A1s (3.1% against 2.1%), and was closer to the total remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there are assurances from the study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment is actually leading to an increase in life expectancy, reports Blackstone from the College of Medicine at Finix, University of Arizona.
According to Swedish studies, the risk of death over 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this had led to fewer than 35 IMT people interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low IMT group where there is no increased risk of death or early illness," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously their weight as long as the IMT of the patient falls into the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to force people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that just as they copy genetic changes that start their bodies with light and diabetes, it's very difficult to turn it back.
There were 9 million rubles from the mine house in the Motishah.
In the Motistas, the kidnappers attacked the residents of the submarine and stole 9 million rubles and three women's shoes.
Interfax is informed of this with reference to the MDR press service.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns, through the open door, entered a house located on the street of the hill, contacted the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatened with both knife, grabbed 9 million rubles and three beads.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, which had been initiated by a criminal case under the article “Razbhai”.
Fantasies from Europe are at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Football Championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still not allowed.
Experts believe it's a very disturbing sign.
In front of the world empire, the authorities must immediately consider how to expel all the guests of the city.
It is believed that the cost of renting the living quarters will increase by 10 to 30 per cent, and that after the summer home campaign, there will be a reimbursement.
The World Football Championship drew the authorities ' attention to the situation of Russian visitors.
According to the law written specifically under the preamble, each Peterburg hotel must pass the classification procedure and prove that it is in accordance with the declared number of stars and levels of service.
It is now clear that not everyone can do this: the waiters are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents at the request of the Federal Anti-Federal Service to Petersburg.
As told by UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the public has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to file 34 cases against visitors, many of whom simply did not respond to anti-temonymists.
There are signs that the leadership of three ten companies has been misleading citizens by placing some other number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that no number can be lost by 2018.
Officials suspect that all peterburg hotels will be occupied during the football team.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 305,000 numbers.
According to Smollo, in Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100 two-star and 550-one-star.
According to the first Deputy Tourism Development Committee, Nana Gwichii, only 23 hotels were currently classified, so many checks were carried out by Peterburg.
And here is whether a hotel has ordered such a procedure for regional enterprises that are not known for the amazing circumstances of the situation.
There may be more to the previous classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last few years of the hotel have not been very hard to classify," acknowledged North-West Russian Union Tourism Office Director Ekaterina Chadskaya.
This is explained by the high season during which the hotels work more money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is that budgets that did not include audit costs, and the procedure could cover hotels depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
In recent times, however, hotel managers have become more active and have started to apply for classification, Chadskaya said.
Fathers must succeed until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay taxes but also not yet have the right to work on the campaign for peace.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed number payment will be made during the tournament.
The formulas to be calculated will be published in the following year.
This has been done to prevent price increases of 200 to 300 per cent, such as in the time of the Petersburg Economic Forum.
There is a need to have a conscience and not to allow improvements in two or three times, but also to be allowed to work.
"I think there will be up to 50% growth," explained President Gennadi Lamshin of the Russian Hotel Association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is involved in economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's the best journey ever," he said.
I don't know what's going to happen with popular cheap hostels.
Members of the House have introduced a bill which provides that hostels should be prohibited from living in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or applied to Petersburg.
"We will defer the point of view that hostels should be maintained," Nana Gwachia says.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-telephones should, in any case, be prepared to adhere to the Housing Code.
If the Lord had so approved the bill, about 80 per cent of the hostels in Petersburg would have been closed and 1.5 thousand numbers would now be available.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hospitals of the North West Leonida Garbara, in Petersburg there are no two- and three-star hotels, which are once and consumed by football patients, so there is a cross-section on the side of a hotel with four and five stars.
The situation is similar when "75,000 elephants sit in the 80th millennium stadium".
This can be fixed as a time for mini-telephones.
Their possible prohibition is, "Idiotism," "I think it's weird that some people can live in rooms, and that's why they can't do it."
If the host is used as a community, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests arrive for a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are at risk of missing the world's football champion and because of their indistinctness.
Hundreds of small hotels are simply unable to pass the classification, and they are self-inflicted.
By 2016 all of the city's hotels will be ordered.
"Companys that can carry out this procedure not so much, so they will reject less paid orders from the mini-vehicles and will choose those who travel," noted Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in several cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of checks carried out at this moment are significantly higher than those of Petersburg.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is associated with the permanent suspension of the Government ' s tourist block, which does not support the work in question.
Experts believe that if the peterburg hotels are not enough, attention should be paid to local hotels and restrooms.
For example, 300-year-old Petersburg can mobilize a river fleet, so there are tournament guests who can live in the cabins.
In addition, many patients are prepared to get to the gymnasiums in which they can sleep.
"The main thing is not to make so many guests that they can then leave," said Gennadi Lamshin.
There will also be increased popularity during football.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of quiet rooms.
Retirement rates will rise by 10-30%.
"From the point of view - the first to go to live near the stadium," noted a development agency rental specialist and research in the immutableness of Larissa Bragin.
The rental price may not return to the previous level after the seminar, especially in sleep areas.
This would also contribute to the construction of new transport links outside the city, she stressed.
It is also important to remember the human qualities of men.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Peterburg has always been a hospitable city where people don't just show the way, but they can still make a mine trip.
There are also difficulties.
In 1970 my dad met a family from Murmanska -- a father, a mother, and two children.
At night, they found it difficult to sleep with the guests.
"And the pope brought them to our municipal apartment to sleep," said the constable.
True, he added that there is no such thing in the city right now - to call home a mess of consequences and terrible consequences.
But might the mistakes of the hospitals and Governments have to be recalled in 2018 after the failed decisions of the Lord?
Girinov's "Sil" Amorian area.
He looked up today at the Girinian clan in the Gosdoma.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers and is still in excellent shape.
The subject of the statement, of course, is "LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amorian area".
The protocols do not interfere with anything; other protocols, except those signed by the elected elected members, are in the LDP, a judge at all. No.
This is the second of the two Ibrahim (Ibrahim) who proclaimed: "You are indeed the winner of the Al-Abrahim (the Day of Resurrection)."
And there's nothing here about the family, and then, after the change with the president, he brings a fraction out of the meeting room, literally "You're all in front of your nails and doors."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on scandal and demarcation of the fraction as a result of this scandal and degradation.
The real Wolfovic was beautiful and elegantly swirling the Amorian area along with Abram.
For the whole country, this is a regular tour of the Girinovian style of the "Podonics!" rather than a political party protesting the results of the specific elections.
And the group formally appealed, and the elections, if we believe the party site and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is clearly coming.
He sends the dead to Amure himself to protect his dead, and he himself welcomes the "One Russia" in general and in no way worthy of the family.
An excellent decision not to lose the person, and in the present and not the shown scandal, not to go.
Another case is that Abram himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition to the fact that he did not expect anything from the authorities, there were no alternatives.
He was not focusing on the public, on the one hand, and on the other, on the shortest circle, he became a formal cause and an insult to the respected champion, and, more importantly, the Hamish Explosives to the EE and UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiaries of the elections, regional policy No. 2 and candidate No. 1 can be converted into money that has successfully been used by its own party leader and super-departurer for the same UNIF and foreign party leader.
That's not exactly what Jirinov would have done. He should have thought about it and almost watched it.
It's still growing and growing.
It was news that LDPR would return to the room during the next plenary session.
It's a bathroom we've never had before.
Only Abram's subject was buried under him.
That's really nice.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe." - Darley-lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
The question of the continuing refugee crisis was raised at the opening of the Dalai Lama Cooperation Centre in Oxford, on ethics studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this was also a source of refreshment, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not an adequate situation.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his own words.
Dali-Lam, while highly critical of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must think about long-term solutions, such as making this world and this development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States had launched a series of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in letter to President Bush and told him that the solution could be through non-violence.
I know his intentions were bad, but he used force, and this had unexpected consequences," said Dlai-Lam.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have lost their hands in the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have had a disincentive for high respiratory tract activity, as reported by the City of Georgia ' s toxicological centre.
According to Dr. Harold Lopes, director of the State toxicology Centre of Georgia, cases of children under 12 years of age with whom hand-deficiency was reported in the toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more often contacted with these substances and, unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the emergency office,” Lopes CNN said.
He said that some children drink detached fluids especially, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show how adolescents drink desicptive fluid as a soft drink.
Teenagers were reportedly mixed with alcohol-containing fluid to get a more solid drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smells of desensitizing fluid.
"The kid doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopes reported.
Many of the most attractive (defined hand fluids) are those that are flavoured.
There are desensitized fluids for the hand with the scent of the club, the wine stand, the orange, which is very attractive to children.
Undefinable hand fluids contain from 45 to 95 per cent of breath.
For young children, in particular, a number of abortions can lead to alcohol abuse.
"It's a high concentration drink," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicological center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave this room out of reach, but people would keep these disinfectants in their hands, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently lost her hand in school with a club flavour in about four outbreaks, was sent to the emergency department.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179 times higher than that of an adult who is considered by law to be an alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, a medical doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
I found her words and she couldn't walk when she was sent to the emergency office.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic so as not to miss any signs of brain trauma, as a girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchi told her.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortorio Scott, Naji's mother.
That could have been fatal for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-explosive substances or disinfectants, in addition to removing detached fluids from the children ' s reach area.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detached fluids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after they lost the disinfectant containing an unexplained toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a mortal agent rather than an ethyl alcohol that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York spoke to reject their "opposite" teacher by “the proliferation of antibacterial substances in the class”, according to a police report.
The teacher had strong allergic reactions to hand disinfectants, and she refused to keep them in her class.
The police consider that the failed plan was "empty talks", and addressed matters of discipline to the school area.
As the oldest child library in Barnaule became a family club.
On the back of the stairs at their local children's library, N.K. The Red Cross is a strange room.
Young people who come after books are trying to feed it with their suitcases.
It has been in this library for over 95 years.
In the 20th century, the first readers of the book of the Bible had collected a collection of books here, put a show on the Maya text, conducted literature victors, and rewritten with Lenin.
The list went on for four years, and, as The New Stalice newspaper of 1939 wrote, every day “a friendship between the Hope of the Constantine Cross and Friends of the City of Barnaul Children's Library” became ever stronger.
The hope of Constantine even once sent his childhood photograph to a far - off Barnault friend.
And when the Barnaulists asked if the Constantinov hope for the library to adopt its name, she wrote that it doesn't.
The letter was long burned at the museum, and first - century readers had to explain that it was a serious profile that adorned the library’s walls.
In the years of the reconstruction, people often called out, wondering: Why is the child’s library not named?
It'll be a library of the name of a good child writer without a political class!
The library staff lived in the village, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Crustic" is, please, the most famous and beloved library in Barnaule, like "Linca" in Moscow.
On the ground in the library is a road from the eager kiln.
"The Volleyball of the Immaculate City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oly Moscow.
Ola used to be the manager of the legal company, she came to work at eight, she went to five, and all the other managers were different from just love to paint.
And then she found a statement on the Internet: "You need an illustration for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl named My Cancer Mommy.
Ola made an illustration, and she thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracle in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, pictures the books of the writers of the world, and makes stories her own.
Traditionally, children seem to be losing interest in the book that they're growing up in some virtual space...
But to us, children are reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of the library of Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years we've even had such a moment of confidence that a child library is needed, and it's going to live - kids coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library has a large exhibition with an up-to-date photo exhibition.
Once in the neighborhood, new photos of readers are taken from the library of the entire family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is pleased that the children have become more and more involved with the popes.
If the child has been reading all of the Chukova in two years, he needs more books at an older age.
But now there is a law prohibiting eight-year-old Underkind from issuing books from category 12+.
To obtain such a book, the child must be brought back to his parents - they come back, then they return, and gradually the "Crussels" becomes a family club for them.
In the library there is a hidden treasure - a red - and - white - haired red - eyed collection, which will bring the Kingenco into an annex to the magazine "Niva", the 1936 Mürzillki subpoena.
Now that we're not just the conceptual space of the temple of the book, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatyana Kushvid.
We can come together to respect, play, dance.
We've made a game zone for the little ones. The kid just has to play, and his hands are all tied to the book!
Some of our parents bring them in, and they are beaten with knives, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with bicycles, and we're glad that they put the library first among all the other places that have to come with the little ones.
Tatyana Kushvid says: Modern children like us sometimes like classic children's literature:
"The issue of extradition is now under way, and there is a lot of attention to authors who are related to generations."
And when it comes to small children, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to hang out with their heroes.
The library regularly issues booklets for parents who tell them what is happening in today’s child literature, which books should be taken into account and why.
The booklets are so attractive and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Bringing books outside the reading room to adults is prohibited.
This loving privilege is only available to children.
...In the next room of the library there is a square hole with an old wooden woodwood tree in the basement, in the library.
The stairs will be cut under your steps. It's a very old time machine.
From the book of your childhood you meet like an old friend: "Hi, it's good that we don't change."
Ellie still enjoys walking along the road with a zeal-encumbered cricket, the Tola Rizikov flight is full of wild boars, and Malchiš-Kibalciš has not spoken to the bloody Burguns of the War Secret -- that's what he's saying.
Such books as passwords, they can be found anywhere.
There are in the warehouse and the current bookstores - for example, the revolutionary collection was with food and vegetables.
Or take the Kingenco into the famous annex to the magazine "Neva".
Or "Murzyllki" support for 1936.
When the pages were old, they were beautiful in tea.
This publication is not for sale.
It's all about our future collection, I'm going to go to retirement and take a few children's books.
But kids don't act like this: and the beauty in the old books isn't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the communist.
Now it's said, "Why did we all write this "Pionerial Truth?"
But everything was equally interesting, says Galina Ilyasov, the Russian Planet.
The "Murzyllki" pages have been dark for ages.
Galina Vasilievna has spent her entire life in the library.
She knows what a beautiful doll in Buratino, which in the school year, Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindora's team at the race championships in which Carlson uses an audience for the bike and who works for the father of Alice Seleznevo.
The library pays little for the work, and anyone who can live without these books quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, pedagogues, book cults.
They can still be known for their beauty - it is thought to be the professional picture of the children's library.
If he got you down in the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I like children's books at all: as a librarian, I like them to be at all levels and beautiful, and I still love to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I'm reading everything: military, historical behavior, statements, fantasy.
Reading contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think I had everything else in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them so much, I was told that the library was a place of worship.
And I wanted to work where they all sat and read.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the knights.
And I'm glad our ex-readers bring children, and that's what our grandchildren...
Listener: There's no difference in Seltique
Griffiths discussed the differences in Seltice after Dahl's confession that Hups was in a bad situation, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the claims of the Scottish Football Association to Nelson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that could break the team's unit.
Dons increased the advantage before Seltic up to five points.
Penalti Adama Runi in the first team gave Aberdinu a small advantage over Gamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to move from Seltic to five.
Griffits discuss differences
This led to hearings of differences in Seltique, which were interrupted by Griffits, who said that he and his teammates were not suffering from any stronger criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the games are working on it.
The Dutch are disappointed because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur.
Former Rangers and former member of the Dutch General Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch footballers had lost interest in Seltik because he did not meet the title of the Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajaxa, said: "In the Netherlands there are no more exciting moments of the Seltic game, and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The Old Company games are very exciting, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltik was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach was trying to change everything.
As a result of the defeat of Malmyo and the departure of the League of Champions, he was soon following the 10 footballers Aberdina, who are now on the top of the table.
However, Dale said, "In "Seite" there were bad times and before, and we'll get out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very embarrassing, and there were no people very, very bad or confused about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need Seltic's support because this game is getting much better.
Stay together now is so important.
Warberton is waiting for the January transfers.
Despite the views expressed a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the purposes of the January transfers, Mark Warberton's "Ranger" boss was allegedly referring to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former Frontford attacker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to games coming in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The command works really well.
Sometimes more harm comes from adding unnecessary toys to what you really need.
A mouse who's interested in Seltik has been forced to finish his career.
The attacker Sunsi Mitch, who was associated with Seltic at the time of the transfer window, insisted that he could leave a football after the end of his contract with Lebedam.
The 29-year-old game suffered from a boat problem for two years, and I couldn't leave Wales that year.
Harts is going to oppose SFA for Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said with account 2:1, when they removed Patterson, and they started playing 3:2, but later canceled the protective red card; this is the third red card Collum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson is not rebutting his words, claiming: "I didn't doubt ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths tried to escape the Tanks.
The direct game of the Hybernian team was given after he admitted that he had sung a song with words of regret about the former game "Harts" Rudy Skacell.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn region in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Denmark in March 2014.
"It was a drill, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going back to Dinkasl if he didn't play "Seltik."
Donnelly: Tannadis Council Trusted in Dandy United Management
Simon Donnelly argues that the Danish United Council of Directors remains convinced that the management team will change the situation better, but it is agreed that the deterioration in the field should be done.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids out again," Donnelly said.
Makines is glad he won "unbelievably" at Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team Aberdin had to fight Hamilton Assisi in an unexpected way to win the seventh victory in the first line, which placed them on five eyes above Seltica, above the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first team.
MacInness said, "There's no command here that anything will win -- a cube, or a league champion who won't win a meeting like this."
Unemployment among Scottishs does not change as it grows in the United Kingdom as a whole
Unemployment in Scotland remained at the level of 164,000 people for the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased from 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 people in three months, while the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has decreased to 74.0%, which is higher than the average in 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
In commenting on the latest figures, Scotland Minister David Mandel noted: "The Government ' s long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy".
It has been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market in Scotland in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why am I a witness to the murder in Oklahoma?
Today, from a later stage of legal intervention, I'll see how people are being punished.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in a visual gallery of the deaths in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossyp will be executed by means of a death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique course.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the U.S. executions, and since they often want more than a place, the results of the dark lotteries decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of places for the press decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he'll look at it without any emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll sit with my closest friends Richard Glossip, and we'll have our own relationship with him after a couple of months of phone calls and a visit of two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a block and a hand to record what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being rude to Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes to get access.
I begged her.
She admitted that she herself could "be better formed", but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with anything I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I couldn't do it even if he was talking.
I told him he could get me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international publisher to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement to undo the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the evidence I've written.
I'm not gonna be here in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossy is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez are responsible for the crime.
But I believe there's a lot of chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this course, I'll see how he's gonna die.
I can't say I'm going to be quite objective.
There will be other reporters that can be contacted.
From me you know what it's like to see how a person I like dies without need.
Followed by the human police have been ordered to flee the Canning River
A survey from Canning-Wilt City has been able to negotiate a man to pick up from the Canning River and to remain dry.
The mayor of Perta was planning to leave the police, but he did not hesitate to stop in the rough water for a few yards from the police officer trying to "bet him out on the beach".
The Canning-Willa police were called on Tuesday because of the illegal investigation into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by jumping into Canning.
But he didn't run away.
"He stood in the water and said "I'm not going out, let's get me," said senior Sergeant Chandel Casldian.
Laklan Perhavec's constituencies did not want to take shape, so he used a safer reception -- "talks with good police."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said senior Sergeant Casldian.
That's what Ben Kazins football champion did and remembered.
In 2006, Kazins went to the kitchen to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to rehabilitate Suon.
His efforts were brutal, but the local people were moved to excommunicate the fake "Batlon Ben Kazins".
Peter Mudi accuses Stuart of attempted spying and threatens to leave the horse sports
Peter Mudi accused Stuart Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his horse last year and threatened to leave the horse immediately.
His car was stolen by members of the Racing Victoria ethics department, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start of the drug use on the day he started, in the middle, became the last slom.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in jumps, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Leader's test on football, which he could not explain.
He kept language about suspicions in the spinach for years and didn't want it to look like a green vineyard.
"I didn't want to talk about it, and I've been suffering for a long time, but sometimes it's so hard on you that you don't stop," Mudy said.
They know it's gone.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to face the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home today and get some sleep.
I want to go with my head high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that's not true, I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
Former Mudi sensitically said during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart lived in a room with a man I call if they ask, and they offered him a job in my horse so that he could give me information about what I'm doing in the horse," Mudy said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a witch.
If so, they all must make statements because they have failed to understand me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Mudi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondy, current Executive Director of RVL, knew about it all the time and are now aware of it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's going to be a personal matter?
Should not RVL be courageous and respond to what is going on in this business, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Is that how bad I am for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
They may have to get me a license and get me out of here, and I don't doubt what I'm talking about right now, they might think about it.
But I've come to the point where I'm all right now, and that's how I'm gonna get it.
I'm so sorry about this.
I will give them pressure and responsibility for decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The trainer's staff only grew up in a long investigation into the case with Cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the bad news from the start forced him to say that he could "roll his license on the table".
Mudi, the most famous of all known for the preparation of the victorious Black Caviar champion, called for the use of medical preparations on the day of “smoothing” after the pressure on the feet of the ills was brought from the clay, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of jump rules.
"I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my fault employees made her stick on her leg.
She could've got a compression last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday as it was.
She was with him the day he ran away.
Muds may be disabled for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medical preparations on the day of the coagulation of the pressure by which the steroids opened the investigation.
It's the anecdotes.
People who create these rules know nothing about bad things.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Mudi.
The driver who visited and hid from the scene in Cuba was arrested
The police arrested the man who had stolen the motorcycles in Cuba from the scene.
Motorcyclists took him to the airport at the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after he got his car on Murray Wally Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcycle.
On Monday, 50-year-old residents of the city of Natalia were sent to the police in Sheppartton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene, refusing assistance and violating other traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, lives in a stable hospital.
Trainer "Melburn Storm" Craig Bellamie has been charged with the use of violent arrests by opponents.
The trainer "Melbourn Storm" Craig Bellamie called the criticism of his team's capture of the sword as "agreement of the agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL.
The "Sidney Rusters" coach Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed "Storm" to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" at the end of the qualification game in Sydney at Friday night.
The coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made a clear look at "Storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at "Nosern Queensland Caubois" on Saturday night when he called this game "typical" for the League of Regiby and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "too successful" in hand-cuffing.
The Whites protected the capture of the sword by their team and said that they were simply focused on contact, with the capture of the sword.
Bellami added that he was convinced of his team's criticism by two leading trainers, since this meant that they were worried about possible defeat by the Storm.
"It's still going to rain--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the harsh receptions when they played us with account 24:2," said Bellami in the middle.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything throughout the year in our systems or protection techniques, just in the last six weeks we have given special attention to contacting dogs, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he's clearly training a different team, so he's probably not used to playing, and that's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this is always going to happen this year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of "the impressive football" and reminded his teacher that "St. George Illavarra Dregons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing "the football."
Wayne's talking about an undercover football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and see how impressive their game was," said Bellami.
I remember that in 2010, St. George wasn't criticized, calling it a cowardly command, and Wayne said that he wouldn't care.
But now he has a command that can show that he thinks it is an impressive football, especially for his young defenders with their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play.
This gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're worried about a few things.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they were going to big games.
Bellami also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rusters" were a combination of a lot of glasses than the game "Broncos" and "Caubois".
The Bronchos game was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was it? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts -- and what, is this really an impressive football?
Or consider the impressive obstacles and failures?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means we can meet them there at some point.
At the end of this weekend, as they won the right to receive Nort Queensland Caubois, or the Royal Sharks, the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park Pre-final at the AAMI Park stadium, the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Detained Serbs are released at $200,000
A man who was threatened with life imprisonment for trying to hire 40 kilograms of cocaine delivered to Queensland by a contractor was released at $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of the five persons arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the island of Solay, from South America through Vanuatu and smuggled into Kumer in August.
During the whole morning, Maximovic and his reporters saw them on the docks, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite the threat to Maximovic ' s lifetime of attempting to acquire drugs in sufficient quantity for sale, counsel Maximovic claims that there is no evidence that the last attempt to seize the whole party was being made and that the man could be in the coffee without any intention.
The Supreme Court's judge, Peter Flanagan, questioned that Maximovic had to resign.
Last time there was contact with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court in the middle.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about where he was found.
The mother and father of Maximovic were invited to submit a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
“It is evident from both of them that the amount of the $200,000 deposit is too much financial burden for them,” said Judge Flangagan.
One such measure, however, is insufficient to guarantee that it will not disappear, has been added by the judge.
The maximum permit was granted to be released on the condition that it will arrive at its Australian and Serbian passports every day and observe the command hour from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Fotois Cacicaris: "I'm proud of Greece's collection which was before the last second."
The Chief Trainer of the Greek Collection, Fotos Cacicaris, gave his command after match 1/4 Eurobusket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the court of the game had made some mistakes.
It was a big game -- quoted by AFP Cacicaris.
We were ready for a great game to play with the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defence, but the defence errors identified the trial.
It's a lot of fun, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freyland, "I'll be charged with the office of law in the CSCA."
CSCA newsman Joel Freyland said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to overcome the negative trend and finally win Eurolog in the next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this year and, of course, after I joined the team, "R-Sport" of Frilland. - Actually, I'm going to be charged with the functions of Sashi Kauna, who left the team both in protective buildings and in a three-second zone attack, and I think I can handle this.
Yes, I'll need some time to re-establish the central position, but I played forvard more in NBA.
Now it's going to be more difficult to resist a bigger central opponent, but I've been doing this before, so I think I'm going to do it now.
The army won Eurooliga for the last time in 2008.
Since then they've been going to the "Four Finals" six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's an opinion that the team has been heard by someone.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's hard, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its patients.
But we have a different team now, and if we're going to show us what we can do, we have a good chance to win Eurolog, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, and the Mosquiks have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSC.
As far as the vote is concerned, I'm not a fair man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you join these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before I play, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Louis Enrique, "I'm gonna have a fight with Rome."
The main trainer in Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome on the 1st tour of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the instructor, his current and former team will be far from fair.
Remember that Luis Enrique trained "volkov" in the 2011/12 season, but did not show up on the best side of the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years ago, after which I gained some experience. The official website of WEFA contains the words of Luis Enrique.
I have a very warm memory with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it doesn't matter.
The main thing is to start the League of Winning Championships.
The August meeting at Cubak Joana Gamper does not affect the action of the team in the next match.
I'm waiting for "Rome" game that she showed in the A series against "Juventus".
It's a strong command that can press and know what to do with the sword.
Vadim Script: "Grasundar" has various options for attacking.
The Chief Trainer ' s responsibilities, Urala ' Vadim Sripčenko, in front of the 9th Prime Minister ' s round with Krasundar, noted the diversity of the attacker ' s command.
According to the teacher, there are several models of the game in their arsenal.
The week will be 21 September and will begin at 16.30 p.m. by Moscow time.
As we play with "Grasundar," let's see what the official Urala website says.
We've got a whole week of training.
This team has various types of attacks, many of which attack itself, while we are not slow, so I believe it will be a very interesting game.
In front of this game, given that Krasundar is playing the game of the European League against the Borusia Dortmund League, we are trying very well to get ready to win.
Roher Canyas: "The House of Astana can pick out the eyes of whom it fits."
Astana's protector Roher Kanyas, after the first round of the team tournament of the League of Championships with Benfiko (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the opinion of the Hawbek, in his field of asylum, he can pick out the eyes of any opponent.
Although the match has been hard for us, I can say that we played well, the official WEFA website says Kanyas.
"Benfica" is higher than class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick up their eyes.
It's completely real.
But she had to start thinking about Galatasara and then about Athletics.
In domestic matches we can pick eyes in any way.
Raphael Bennetis: "How much more convenient: Christian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Chief Trainer Raphael Bennetis expressed satisfaction at the great victory in the 1st round of the League of Championships tournament with "Shahter" (4:0).
The Specialist gave up on Christian Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
The Match was not easy because the Shahater was able to control the sword, the official website of the WEFA word Benitsa.
The contestant had few moments, but their contracts were always hidden from danger.
I'm not saying that Real played perfectly, but we had great opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the cat and killed four.
Christian Ronald has confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world. I'll repeat it a few times.
Jordi Alba: "Christian Ronald can't be compared to the Messiah."
The Barcelone Protector, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare with his sole clubmate Lionel Messi.
According to Spanish, the "Real" forum for Christian Ronald can't do that either.
The Messiah on five heads above the other, says Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: Barcelona has not only unique style but also clear individualities.
The champion of Rome, Daniel De Rossi, was the target of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of competitiveness and insurance in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will be tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 p.m. in Moscow.
Remember, CE will carry out its text.
"Barcelona" is a special opponent, a good team with great games, citing the official website WEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-grains because they have not only unique style but also bright individualities.
To leave them, we have to go through all the fighting and give each other a sense of security.
The Messiah has almost always been successful when he comes into the process, so we need to keep competency and organization.

Holkiper SCA Ilya Ejov stressed that it was expected to enter the start of the army at the next KHL championship.
Ejov went on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen at the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the brooches on his door, the fourth floor of SCA missed after the door was replaced by the sixth field game.
The next team match will be on the way out against "Slovana".
I hope I'll go out in the next game in the start-up, "R-Sport" says Ejova.
I'm not an expert at the door, I'm a doorkeeper, we don't have any retraceable heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone had bad matches.
The command's gone the same way.
I'd better miss more, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to force the pedophiles to send photos
Pedophil used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to draw images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up a girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered in the Internet service where she received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the phone, and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogga.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew her mother's attention.
The police came and saw five images, followed by computers found at this address, and found “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it could " attract the pedophiles", and then he would "bet he's a cop to scare them".
Judge-in-law Elid Robertson told the judge of the sheriff in Denmark: "He said that it was an harassment, he was trying to scare people.
He recognized that he had made requests to the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to join the police to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and that he asked him to send more photographs.
He said he did it to deceive them.
He said he had a headache when he was five and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl discovered the photos on the phone, she called her mother, her children and cried.
She saw inappropriate images on the phone, and then the accused was given an eye rate.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used the computer and Pleistechn to talk to girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23 from Ward Road, Denmark, recognized himself as guilty of the alleged allegations of ill-treatment of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of the sentence on 25 January this year and not being brought before the court on 24 March this year.
Lawyer Gregor Sim asked not to include Hogga in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it could be shown that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alister Carmicel dismissed the sentence until October, before the social services were dismissed.
Hogg was dismissed under the charge of this case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on other cases.
It was included in the list of persons who committed sexual offences until the date of the sentence.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is not here in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the senior government leader of Africa, had earlier this year fallen out of the basement.
He did not suffer, but video clips were currently being distributed on social networks.
Parliament's opening was also outraged by the statements made by parliamentary oppositioners that they had received anonymous threats from Mugabe during treatment.
A month ago they informed the President during his visit to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of the Movement for Democratic Change Innocent Goneze said that seven opposition policies had received text messages on their mobile phones without interrupting Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not reflected but is entitled "Death", he told journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members of Parliament that inconsistencies would end in Parliament's building, and as soon as they left, Parliament's incompatibility would not work.
A member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Cwanggari was “not worried” about its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reduction of service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered at the company's base, separating computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and services sectors.
Estimates resulting from the proposed reduction of jobs amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, are contained in Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will ensure a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Mag Witman, President and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help move the company into the new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual allocation of over $50 billion and "will be focused on providing previously unavailable integrated technology solutions" to companies, reports the company ' s statement.
This is how the company, trained by the University of Stanford in the 1930s, Bill Hullett and Dave Pacard, for the release of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto has been called "the birthplace of the Crimea Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of reorganization with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a step, second in the world by the manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is a new event in this sector based on the conviction that specialized companies are doing better.
Captain Arsenala Michael Arteta says his alone clubmates should support injured Jack Wilshire before the game with Dinamo Zagreb.
In his discussion with Wilshire Wenger also stressed that only September was yet to come and that if Wilshire's restoration would be planned, he would not have anything to do with returning to Christmas.
With the most favorable development of the events, Wilshire will exactly miss at least four of the next games in England and, in view of what has happened, its participation in the European Championship next year remains the issue.
The most recent problem was that Wilshire was sure to end the previous season with a single trauma boat and was going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-school training.
Wenger: "This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not until the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about ships or traumas that happened before.
These may be related to medical considerations, but there is also the risk of additional trauma for any game returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, at Wilshire, 23 different traumas have occurred with him over six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 out of 157 Arsenala games in the league in the last five seasons.
Looking at Arsenala's layout wider, it can be noted that in six of the eight seasons beginning in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, most of which were spent due to the trauma of the day.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of early exposure, but in Arsenal, he believes that the improvement of the statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for a while, you need to regain your strength and acquire a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure he'll be the one he deserves.
Arsenal launched a campaign in the League of Champions in the middle of the race with Dinamo-Zagreb and continued it on Saturday with Chelsea and the following Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger aimed at rotation.
Rector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so they will soon be playing Matthew Debush and Arte.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kirana Gibbs and Olivia Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walt.
"I'm trying to keep a balance and give a little advance to the games that it needs," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has an unconditional favour in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most pressing in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost one of the 41 fighters since they were given the last season as "Infinite."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake of 3.2 ballasts on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is convinced that Arsenal has accepted the lesson received in the past season when the team has suffered defeat in the League of Championships from Monaco, and remains weak in hopes of bringing the club to victory at the final Cup of Championships.
"It's an incredible drive," observed Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that yet.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm on the move.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedian show that taught us serious lessons about sex
The absence of such stories is reflected, especially in the light of the desperate need for men in openness, now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men were three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of "Campia against Unlucky Life", in 2015, men announced that they would be exposed to cultural challenges that would not allow men to seek help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to take this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if there is a sufficient number of "normal" friends" in the patient, treatment chances are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends has both reduced the chances of mental disorders.
But, of course, to make a friend work, first of all, it needs to be her.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the quick response is often more valuable than content.
Our digital life doubles the need to be spoken of as a strong, happy and successful person, even if the king is truly one.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, imagery, social status, the cycle of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which strongly influence our mental health.
And as one billionaire, a video player, recently noticed, you don't buy any more luck for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each individual was identified, not by his work, but by the personality he had shared with his friends.
Yumor Joey and Chandler's constant arrests, moments of look at the football on comfortable chairs, Rossa's breathing on Rachel -- all comes from understanding that men can feel this, even if they often refuse to study their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer told me, "My role as a listener to people who feel depressed and suicidal is to emphasize how even the smallest public friends can benefit."
The men who call on us often feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old doctrine "live with it" is as strong as it feels that open discussion of problems can be understood as weakness".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose more working mechanisms for overcoming.
It highlighted the masomatized moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a sidewalk on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long - term support comes from a close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these exits, where the holidays are completely restored, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk?
Or even better - if you see a single person in Starbucks, relax and say "Privet".
Don't think about the benefits of friendship.
A series of Friends shows Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria's killing a bullet by helping the P.S.D. to play Malmya.
Angela Di Maria, along with Blaise Matthew and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the killings at the door of Malmyo.
Anhal Di Maria, de-debtting in the League of Champions, killed a bullet that made it easier for the PSD to hit the Malmyo on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the match and the reaction of the game.
Anhal Di Maria and Edinson Kawani did their work when "Paris Saint-Jermen" started their game in the League of Champions with a very comfortable victory of 2:0 against "Malmō" at the Park de Prens stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed a sword less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions began as a game of the "PSP" to attract French champions, but they lost a number of opportunities until they finally increased their advantage when Kawani killed him naked at the 61st minute.
In addition to Real Madrid and the Dutch Shahater group A, "Pari" had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions because they were not aimed at qualifying playoffs, but at continuing a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they came up to the four finals.
They hired glasses, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blane to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against the command from his hometown and club, where he started his flashing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests in the League of Champions, so to win with 2:0, to deliver problems to opponents and to play well in protection -- it's a good start, even if there are still moments we'll need to work through the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, even though I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two dogs anymore.
Ibrajimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing from 2:2 in the field of "Bordo" in the first league in the east, but he gave it back to Día Maria's back level at the fourth minute.
Argentinian attacker noted how a game capable of bringing the PSP to a new level in Europe had been bought at the Manchester United in the last month, and he demonstrated why when he fled from Marko Verarti behind the protection of Malmyo and successfully completed the attack by the sword outside of Johann Willand in the distant corner of the gate.
However, if anyone had waited for the easy and great victory of the PSI, they would have been disappointed.
"Malmy", which won Seltik's playoff to achieve this stage, with nine world-level games in the field at the beginning of the game, five protectores and two opposing semi-trailers in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the attack by Nicola Jüdžic, when the sword flew over the distant wall of Kevin Trappa at 34 minutes, they attacked very little.
Therefore, during the time of the PSC, he was subjected to inexhaustible transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to perform at least five attempts in the first half, and then was unable to process the sword killed by Cavani immediately after the game was resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skillful in the exact passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovic, who was sent by D. Maria with a knife tied to his head, which went to the train outside of Willand for 52 minutes.
The second round was finally killed after the time was recorded by Kavani, the warrior killed his sixth sword in the season after Ibrahimovich had set up a sword sent to the centre of the field from the left wing of Maxwell.
This led to the end of any idea of return to the game at Malmyo, and only the capture of Willand's sword from a nearby distance did not allow David Luis to increase his final account before the replacement of Ezekiel Lavessi was counted naked at the very end of the match.
Teacher Age Hareide later acknowledged that PSG was a class above his team, while a Norwegian said: "Our last game in the League of Champions was held in December last year."
Since then we've only played in Swedish league, not that level.
Qualifications are insufficient.
It's the glory of Paris!
That was a great match with them.

White House confirms her visit to Zzinpin in Washington.
The White House confirmed in its official report on Tuesday that the head of China Si Zzinpin would come with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.

From the men's injuries in 1989, the birth took place.
Friends of the victim of social networks reported that the driver BMW was running at high speed and went to the meeting room in front of the DTP.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the babokers had organized a motorcycle race from the Ward Mountains to the building of GUMVD Moscow in Petrovuke, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it was known that the result of the investigation had been maintained by the alleged DTP prosecutor.
In Moscow a man was detained in the temple of a naked man.

There is a second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus in Sochi.
From 17 to 18 September, Sochi was the second regional forum of Russia and Belarus, which would be attended by the Timorese delegation, headed by the Governor.
The upcoming activities in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation are described by the Honourable General Council of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Shugla, which is formed by the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Cochinium Forum?
The scale of activities in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the United States.
It is focused on fruitful cooperation between regions, which is an important element of relations between the two States.
It is planned that President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus will take part in the plenary meeting.
During the plenary and sectional meetings, it will relate to the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the legal assurance and programmes of the Union.
The Forum will be held by the Governor of the Tumen area.
I believe that this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of the ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian enterprises.
Trade brands and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be held.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new useful contracts and agreements.
I add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two delegations, including 19 Russian regions, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Temena and Minas.
The importance of our work also relates to the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumeni at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Russian Union and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region came to the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarus in training for agriculture, to identify additional focal points and to organize new investment projects in the area of agro-industrial integration.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of town administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tuman region, Vladimir Yakoshov spoke on cooperation between the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern circumstances.
The issue of the delivery of Belarusian agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they need to reduce the cost of cars for the final consumer.
The problems were discussed in the Berlin Timber Trade House and the options for the prevention of losses.
The issues are important, as investment projects must be clearly working and contributing to the region's income.
The further supply of the OAO "MAZ" passenger cargo technology was addressed by the development of the OAO "MAZ" service centre, which was established in TUmeni on the basis of "TPATP".
The discussion has continued to prepare for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another theme of the debate was the conclusion and signature of the Agreement on Trade and Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation in the Telecommunications Area and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relations promises to enter a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the regional centre.
At a meeting with the mayor of the city of Tumeni, Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the floor, so a new part of the vehicle from Belarus will be required to operate on gas, environmentally clean fuels.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator plant works with one of the leading oil producers of the OAO "Mogolyveliftmas", receiving the package.
In my view, this could become more active, taking into account new elevators programmes in the area centre.
I add that, within extended powers, the Consulate met with Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexe Kokorin, during which the issue of increased trade and supply of modern Belarusian technology was discussed in Zaurala.
At the end of September, a meeting was scheduled with the Man Governor.
The expanded consular area consists of five RFs, but the Tumen can be called its own headquarters.
The region is a pool for many future projects, including the work of the honourable gender community.
In general, such meetings are significant and good for enabling direct and rapid solutions to many problems by taking them seriously and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the business by continuing to work for the future.
The aim of Damon is to focus on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon argued with the U.S. President Effi Brown, saying that it was not necessary to take ethnicity into account.
At the time of the Resurrection Project Greenlight show on the HBO channel, a well-known actor beat Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view of the main black hero selected for the project scenario.
"Many things are appropriate when you're doing casting for your own movie, not for the show," Damon said.
Bronze Brown, who didn't believe his ears, insisted on calling out "Oh, nothing." Well, no" all the time while an actor from "Marsianina" commented in the immediate ephere.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Ben Afflict and Brother Farelli joined Ben Afflict's colleagues.
"I would like the participants - regardless of who will be the director - to think about what harmonies are going to be held," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute who beats a white container.
The film producer Dear White People said that film directors became Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancačcho; Damon was very opposed, saying, "We can therefore not get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks were exposed to negative comments from Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily said of the video: "The explanation of the magnitude of the crowd from Matt Damon is the only black man in the TACOE BELOE room that is sick."
Twitt picked up more than 5,000 revets and 4,000 lakovs.
Damon's statements appear once when grammatical education on the topic of race in the media is the most serious issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the Prince mentioned this movement at the time of the nomination of the candidates for the "Albom Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Alboms are still important," he said.
Like the books and the lives of black people, the albums are still important.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement leaders have issued an official statement in response to the question of Officer Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbek on whether this group will be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of business actors, vendors and media agents invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted an invitation and met Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
The professional scaler and assistant officer Isaac Caldero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, leaving home at $1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season that had just ended, none of the participants had been able to go through all stages of harassment.
At the end of the season, two participants -- Caldero and Jeff Britten, were in the final round.
The final task included a 75 foot stand stand in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the first task and took the time to become the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, last stage 4, but Caldiero achieved the task for all three seconds earlier, which made him the winner.
After winning the incredible job, Caldero, who was shocked by what he won millions of dollars, gave an interview "E!News."
"It's amazing to think about it, but I never worked and lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented to E! such a serious jump in my income.
And secondly... I've never even imagined myself like this... the future is unknown.
The executive director, Kent Wood, met with journalists The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britain, who first went through the process, won't receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, money is the fastest participant.
"If there's more than one finish-up game, it'll get the fastest one," Said Said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a change in life, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels that way.
He was happy about what he did.
He got tons of twisted calls from fans.
He's a great man and a family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" quietly handle "Minnest Twins"
Minneapolis - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers now takes the last place in the Central Division of the United States.
All I'm saying is to make a move, Tigers with a flash win on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with 5-4 on the Target field.
Twins had the chance of cutting off Houston Astros and taking the second place in the playoff of the number of glasses after the winners.
For detroitists, let it even be one night, it was the return of the word to letter F, which resulted in most of them in the second half of the season.
"All the players are happy, no matter how they get," reported Tigers Manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher Tigers, Alfredo Simon, made his contribution in support of the attack, which resulted in Detroit picking up three glasses in the first two innings and then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was drunk in 6 1/3 innn. He missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start after nine.
"I just want to end the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers can't swim in each game, and that's why I want to go into the game more deeply.
The appointed Tigers Killer Victor Martines was killed three times and two wounded -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattel Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked a good bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself (as a poet), much better in his play and kept this quality for the game.
I picked up three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, "Twins" took his best chance to get back to the game.
The central recipient of Byron Baxton opened up an inning double on the left side of the field.
Reitfielder Aaron Hicks, made a band, took the first base, and second Bisman Brian Dozer got a strike at Simon's height before he took his place on the left side of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surrounded Moera, the only game on the way, before a new appointed killer named Miguel Sano, who picked up a double "single" left from the right Drew Verhagen.
In the case of a couple of injuries not in a car and a similar wound on the second base of VerHagen, a third Bishman named Trevor Pluffa was able to be shot in a double plane.
It was the 27th time for the lead game of the highest league in this season when the Wolf hit the ball on the ball.
After Detroit added the insurance wound to the first half of the ninth inning, Moer hired RBI "dablom" in space between the outfields against closing Tigers" Bruce Rondona, and account was 5-4.
However, the right-hand game won Sano after three strikes and got his fifth seat.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary advantage of Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers worked three hours in the first two innings against a deserved drinker who was on the list of injuries before the game, missing more than a month as a result of an explanation.
"Of course not the start I want," said Hughes, "but as the game develops, I felt more comfortable and therefore I was able to carry out a few pretty good bridges in the third inning."
After the first building was built on the first floor, Hughes brushed off the second bassman, Jan Kinsler.
In two automobiles, J.D. Martines took out Victor Martines, who made a single one in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martines finished his zero-to-21 series with the racers in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Casteljanos, then made single, took another wound, but Victor Martines was shot trying to get closer to the third base, so the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers increased the second inning account by getting one-time Double from James McCann's catcher and two-way single-way central opponent Anthony Gouza, and it became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager, "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good, but he fell straight to the point he needed.
Huss, who was thought to have been found to be the third innkeeper, was then replaced by A.J. Ahter's right-hand relifer.
Huzo counted three shots for six hits and four shots.
NOTE: Pitcher-right Tigers Anabal Sanchez has been removed from the games due to the length of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchesu's field operation in 2007.

The original complaint of Kathirov on the book "Maybe to God" came to the South Sakhalin Court.
In the South Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal was received by President Chechny Ramsana Kathirov for the decision to recognize "Extraest material" of the book "Maybe to God: its importance and place in Islam", reports Interfax, referring to President Alessandra Chukhray.
The Court is now waiting for the possible opposition of the parties to the process.

"Let them comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor filed an appeal against Judge Natalie Percenko for the recognition of the book "extremist material".
The South Sakhalinska prosecutor came to the appeal on Friday night.
There are news: The prosecutors believe that they have asked the court to accept only the opinion of the author of this book, not the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor, the judge had taken a wrong decision," Chukhray reported.
The decision to recognize the book "Extremist Material" was adopted on 12 August 2015.
These are the verses of the Qur'an which are called: "We worship You, and ask for Your help," and "Do not call anyone else than Allah.
Katharivo called the decision-makers on the book "Satans and Prosecutors".

According to GBU Ritual, when there is a need to expand the area, the builders are trying to maintain existing forest masses as much as possible.
Green crops will serve as a living shelter that will divide the rest areas and areas that are taken directly from the places to be buried.

Economic News — Nobel laureate: Globalization
The printing of globalization processes should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in income in developing economies, on the other hand, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education for low-qualified workers, he is considered by Eric Maskin, the chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of NIUs, the Nobel Prize for Economics, 2007.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The parties to globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these forecasts have come true in a lot," Maskin emphasizes.
Thus, for example, China and India have received a significant increase in GDP in the population.
But not all are so happy.
Globalization is expected to reduce the gap between "poor" and "poor" in poor countries, which is marked by a large gap in income and more precisely the wage of work.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why did the global markets not reduce inequality in developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NIEW.
In conjunction with economist, Professor Michael Cremer Eric Maschin of Harvard University has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the gap in income in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, NIE W.E.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, the Machine has four levels of qualification for the rich countries - A and B, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D experts from poor countries were not qualified to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if poor C workers grow due to cooperation with B staff from rich countries, the D workers do not feel or their wages fall.
The impact that internationalization of production will contribute to increasing the wage gap between the two categories of experts in poor countries and, accordingly, the level of inequality.
The creamer and E. Machine offered an amazing beautiful model, an alternative riccardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alesserov, an ordinary professor at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the Department of Maths of the U.S.
And as every powerful theory, I'm sure it will bring empirical work into this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Erica Maschina, is to improve the level of education for low-qualified workers.
However, the students themselves do not have the means to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role.
The scientist noted that the developed theory did not, in any case, call for a halt to the process of globalization, which would bring and bring its fruit in terms of GDP growth.

At Homewood, there was a business game at the airport.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried to play the role of airport staff.
To that end, three aircraft models were installed in Domoded.
Young people not only observed and recorded passengers but also served planes.

The United States Mission regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The US Mission in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre ' s foreign literature library.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Mission in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government ' s unilateral decision to close the US Mission Centre at its Russian public library M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps recently taken by the IMF raise doubts about the commitment of the Government of Russia to relations between the Russian and American peoples that have not even been interrupted during the cold war and in other difficult times of our country's long history," said Ambassador John Teft, quoted in an Interfax statement.
The U.S. Centre has established a deep and lasting link between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It served as the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as as as a meeting place with numerous American-style actors, including astronomers, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“The American Centre has only conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities last year and has received more than 50,000 Russian visitors last year”, the diplomat stressed.
Teft recalled that it had been decided about a year ago to close another joint Russian-American project - FLEX (Fouture Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court was quick to settle.
Typical situation: Four officials stood before Judge Suvanter Kumar ' s desk, in obedience to his claims for work done.
The court is not fully satisfied with the quality of your work.
And We have not given you a commandment of 110 pages, that ye may be comforted over it, saith Kumar.
If there's one more cracker, we'll order all the existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NCT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the intensive pollution of the environment, which is accompanied by a massive economic growth in recent decades.
During this period, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution claims, dust collection, geological development, toxic waste and dust construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decided to terminate the building leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: over the past 60 years, India has been one of the most affected and polluted countries in the world since its declaration of independence.
The problem is particularly severe in major megapolis where infrastructure development is not conducive to intensive urbanization: the city is covered by massive droughts, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes from businesses and households, and few of the remaining living masses are destroyed by new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of the Green Movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticised by the Government of Narendre Modi, since it is often the main cause of the rejection of major investment projects.
Yes, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the court 'extreme' and 'unimplementable' decisions.
Sometimes the court's decisions are not really possible within the time limit set by the court, confirmed by an environmental lawyer Raj Panjvani.
However, there is also a positive side to non-executive dolls: at least they force responsible persons to wear.
"His main goal is to break this system," adds a lawyer.
The Green Court has repeatedly changed major lines: it has stopped the construction of airports, power stations and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also trying to remember: for example, during the trial of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Télagan, which contaminated the local river of Phtoroid.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," Kumar commented.
However, such explanations are not always understood by simple people who can change their lives by means of a single chapter of the trial.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital before the public compensation was granted.
Despite the very high popularity and lack of criticism, Svattanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Deli to provide statistics on driving and driving vehicles and suggested that 10,000 additional buses should be bought, first knowing whether they would be able to carry out such a order.
As the Court began to focus on pollution sources such as floods, fuel quality and even road accidents, people’s anger began to slow down.
But the most painful subject of the principal judge became the cleanup programme of the Gang River, with the campaign announced by Prime Minister Narendre Mody last year.
When it comes to the Gange, dedicated to the industries of the river, the judge often ceases to control his emotions and resorts to criticism.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone who drew water from Ganga into God's status, and there was a fever in it, a judge is burning.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of Ghana is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fungal bacteria in this river exceeds 120 times the norm.
Each year from 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million shoppers die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even contributed money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from selling his costume, where he met Barak Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists charged the prime minister with populism: the costume was purchased for $700,000, while at least eight billion was required to clean the river.
The parties to the Green Court agree that India should be on its way longer before it can call itself a developing country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be the environment.
"In the developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as unacceptable growth,” says activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden environment and development centre."

Si Zzinpin calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to achieve its growth, as President Si Zzyppin said on Tuesday in addressing a group that is facing the challenge of leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing openness policy," he said, calling on the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on the Global Intention of Reform.
He said that increased openness and deeper reform would give the economy a new impetus and life-force and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually detached through pilot programmes.
This is an important step since it will play a more important role in the distribution of resources to the market, in ensuring business legitimacy and in increasing transparency, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers conferred on it by its companies by ensuring that companies themselves will carry out their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More areas will be available for private investors in order to increase the openness of the sub-controlled state of the economy sectors.
“The delegation will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions”, stated the statement.
In addition, it will be easier to make applications for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", by optimising the requirements and simplifying the process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Ketan and Minister Liu Junshan and Jan Gaoli.
