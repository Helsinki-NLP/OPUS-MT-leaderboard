28 Deadly Found at the San Francisco Shopping Center
A 28-year-old man who was transferred to San Francisco recently died in a meridian hole in a local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother said, "The works were good for him."
The San Francisco Adli Tüp Foundation, which was located at the Westfield Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning, explained that the 28-year-old San Francisco uncle was identified as belonging to Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Emniyet Administration said that the cause of death had been identified and the investigation had continued.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the U.S. U.C. station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as chief of the department in Boston, had started working as chief of the department of the department of medicine in San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months earlier.
Sons & Daughters' authority stated that this death had turned itself into "a surprise and a last degree of regret."
The speaker found out in the statement "A small team working here like a common family and he'll miss himself very much."
At this difficult time, we want to point out that Frank's family wasn't alone and that our prayers were with them.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was in the hospital at the beginning and said, "So things were going well for him."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He's got a seat and he's dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he could be someone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a man of great heart, a native.
The way to build a relationship with the family has always been to prepare a cup for us and make us eat." Louis Galicia said.
He didn't like going into the store.
My brother, I've always been able to take care of myself.
He said: "This is a she-camel, which has not been worked in her want every day, while everything else is in error."
People with knowledge wanted to call the SFPD News Line from a phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors are in trouble: Call for a new job break
The representatives of the assistant doctors asked that the unions be allowed to slow down their work on the issue of a new agreement.
The British Tabular Unit (BMA) has been called upon to support the General Council of Doctors (JDC) General Council for a more slowdown action since the beginning of July.
JDC said the guards didn't take care of the deal.
He used a rare game in an agreement with the BMA for doctors and students.
This was rejected by 58% of the members of the vote.
In a letter published on Twitter on Friday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt stated that the government had remained "inconceivablely silent" about the issues of the government's refusal of the agreement.
He said, "In the light of this, the JDC Board of Directors used the vote to reject the proposed new agreement completely and was invited to reopen the formal debate on concerns."
The JDC administration has found a formal requirement to allow a program to allow BMA to slow down the work scheduled from July to July, as indicated by the government's silence.
Disagreements caused the assistant doctors to participate in six greves including the first group in NHS's history this year.
Dr. Johann Malavana, the assistant doctor at BMA, used the terms of the BMA's agreement after a rare play.
At the meetings before the hearing of the 44,000 assistant doctors and teacher, he said it was a good deal for BMA members to accept this.
After the vote, Dr. Jeremy Hunt indicated that the deal would be applied to doctors in England in a way that would be transparent.
Russia and Turkey: A 'unsuspecting'?
It's a crisis-end poison.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together to announce that the eight-month war that took place on Saturday was officially ended with words and economic actions.
But when Vladimir Putin St. Petersburg spoke to his fellow Turks at the exhibition hall, I found that the most wanted side was Ankara.
It's stuck. Yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was so weak and he couldn't say that he had any warmth against his own limited standards.
Instead, Recep Tayyyy and Erdoğan mentioned Mr Putin five times, according to one report.
I was surprised at your number.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would not be able to return to a level before the crisis, but would reach a much higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here said that Mr. Erdogan had done nothing wrong.
I think he was showing his soul exactly the opposite of that.
But in the cold season that Mr. Putin was around, he showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
In fact, the first thing she mentioned in her opening statement was the crisis: Turkey's invasion of Russia's warplane at the Syrian border.
Then the attitude of Russia was full of prejudice.
Mr. Putin, he accused Ankara of hitting Moscow on the way out.
The rage was so great, he thought he was a friend.
It's gonna be hard to rebuild in a real sense, maybe impossible.
In August, this changed the attitude of the people of Russia.
He targeted Ankara in a form of media, month-on-month and attack.
Suddenly, it was Turkey's crime of everything.
The most serious of these were the charges brought against the illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the Islamic State in the words of Mr. Erdogan's family in Syria.
He definitely rejected it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was about time to move on.
So far, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin's request for President Erdoğan was rejected.
Russia can view it as a kind of fortune.
The benefits of the fire call for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs friends after a failed job that's happening last month and is about to turn around.
The terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected her very much.
And there's also economic reasons.
Russia's operations have been frequented, especially by the laws of several million Russian tourists transporting to parts of Turkey each year.
That's almost 90 percent.
In Russia, the tour operators and the rental companies are definitely relieved of the fact that flights will continue.
They're in a situation that's linked to the end of the season in your apartment.
And this week, the government television, Turkey's productions were re-authorized to re-emerge fruit and because they would be reduced in prices.
We're gonna get a news report from the Vedemosty newspaper "Tourists There, Domates Here."
But your visit to Moscow had a different political value.
Ankara is angry at the attitude given to the labour market in the West for failure.
In addition to the long-term anger that has been felt over the long period of time because of the progress of the negotiations on membership in the United States, there is Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of his connections with the West and the current.
The Russian leader's call for the support of the elected authorities after the entry into office seems to have certainly been collected from Ankara.
It must be remembered that he himself was an inevitable prisoner for Moscow, who was a root cause of fear of the change in the regime.
This exhibition, organised in this exhibition building on the shore of the sea, represents an "inconsistencies" as an analyst from Russia and Turkey explains to me: the two countries that refuse and act badly are united by the West.
They're very different from each other, despite the appearance of this cross-section.
One of the most important things about Syria is that Moscow supports different sides of Russia and Turkey if it shows itself as a vehicle.
After almost three hours of the first meeting, it supports the fact that two others at the press conference said that this matter was not changed.
When Turkey's Prime Minister clearly refused to raise a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to draw the bottom of these.
There is no clear consensus on how to identify the common land in Syria.
But it's only months after a clear statement was made - and it's certainly good to see at least two leaders start talking about what happened when the member of Nato was in the middle of a Russian warplane crash.
The Icelandic Royal Bank is missing for customers outside of Scotland.
According to the head of the bank executive, the RBS mark will be transferred to the back office.
The Icelandic Kingdom Bank will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Iceland that the RBS market is linked to the global targets of the bank.
Eight years ago, almost all of this was about to take over and give up.
During this period, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This has been supported by millions of steroids for as many sponsors as Wimbledon Andy Murray from the Six Great Raspberry Championship.
But now it was decided that more national brands would be right.
The Icelandic Royal Bank will only be used by Icelandic customers but no new starters will be made.
All flights to RBS will be converted into NatWest except for central and bustling conditions in England and Galler.
The Ulster Bank brand is currently being used for customers in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will be much more powerful for the single bank; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave a report to a company organised for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC told Iceland: "We're no longer going to be a bank with more brands than we're going to be. We're going to be a RBS brand investor, and our staff are not going to be marked."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm not saying it's not global anymore, it's our local goals.
Each of these brands, they're going to come up in a slightly different way in the community, and our staff will work under the name of these brands with customers.
The RBS explained that the Sixth Ulus Championship would not run sponsorship and that it would raise the profile of different brands in the field of sports sponsorship.
The executive said, "Now it's time for us to understand the brand bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, we'd be a great bank for our customers and we'd find it interesting if we said we were gonna test these brands.
But I think you'll see a lot of changes in the work we're doing and not ourselves, but because we're focusing on the needs of customers.
We can redraw these marks, so I think that's why it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3,000 times the prize he won in Newmarket with Predillection.
Dettori broke the champagne after he reached the 3000th square in Newmarket with two success.
Jokey Frankie Dettori won the 3,000th prize in Newmarket on Friday.
On the ground floor, John Gosden's training with Predilance won his second night's career in this village.
Italian, 45 years old, is the sixth jokey to move to this square.
He's following the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Joyy, who found three champions in Ghaiyar before, said, "It's a special situation."
I felt so much because my family was here.
It really makes me happy to be in New Market 30 years ago.
This isn't an important meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - just a Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel tired and relieved.
Dettori accepted reviews by bringing Predilction after the earthquake
In the end, there were two jokeys that arrived in this square: the champion jokey Richard Johnson and 20 times the champion and the famous jokey who was successful in a full-time career over 4300, Sir Anthony McCoy.
Dereby's nine-time winner, Lester Piggott, has 4493 victory in his career
Frankie, it's not surprising that one of our best jokeys and only a few people have reached a mile from us before.
It's a tactical mind that has an element that makes it more difficult to print than others.
It represents its horse race in an unlikely way, and it attracts people for years with its excitement and career.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that he could have reached 6,000.
To be serious, Frankie spent a large part of the 30 years he fought in the United Kingdom that was so good to see.
It has a very exciting character and a very good feature for these English competitions, but it's also an unlikely jokey.
Frankie Dettori praised this mile of stone as a symbol of its fall with the inme movement
Of the contests that he ended, he moved as many as he could, and for half a year, Frankie Dettori became a symbol of English-free fugitives.
It's a way out of the way.
In 1996, the famous 'Great Eidili' race in Ascot took place in a plane crash with many great competitions that took place in 1996, and it was illegal for it not to comply with the law of medicine.
Three years ago this six-month extension period came back during the initial period, but he showed that he had a strong character to correct his suspects and to make the best possible return.
And it can go on for a while; Dettori said he wanted to continue the fight until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian Prime Minister Putin took on the task of special envoy Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin received an unexpected assignment from my special term Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the close circle that Mr. Putin had been trusting for years.
At the age of 63, he was now assigned as a special representative for environmental and transport problems.
In an explanation made by Kremlin, Mr Putin said that he had decided to end the responsibility of Ivanov for Russia's administration, but there was no reason for it.
Mr. Ivanov has been assigned to this position since 2012.
Vaino, 44 years old, is an old diplomat.
In 1972, Estonia's president, Tallinn, was born, was represented by the International Links of the Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) in 1972 and was responsible for Tokyo's greatness.
The presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel were later involved; expressions on the Kremlin website are this way (Russia).
After his assignment, Mr. Putin said, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think that the principal task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of the state through law enforcement and training.
Mr. Putin explained that on Friday, the Russian TV channel wanted you to be fired from Ivanov and offered Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are you kidding me?
This is a brain that admires Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest suspects for a long time and has been serving Soviet security forces to the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin and on public television, they both expressed their desire that my personal letter be removed from office.
However, despite the gaps that have been subjected to cameras, very few people are convinced of this, especially in this time when Parliament's elections are near.
And what about this sort of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
However, the official explanation of Russia's intention to turn its environmental policy into a possible president was very suspicious.
According to Kremlin's website, Mr. Ivanov addressed Mr. Putin as saying: "It's hard at the beginning of 2012 to say that it's a problem - I want you to trust me for four years.
Well, it looks like I've been in office for four years, for eight months.
Mr Ivanov took over this task in mid-2011.
He had previously taken part in his duties of assistance and defence oversight.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Forces such as Your Honor Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin KGB was appointed head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), who took the place of Mr. Ivanov.
When Mr. Putin crossed the line, Ivanov appeared to be one of the five most trusted.
Mr. Putin's third term was thought that since he was opposed to his mother's leadership, Mr. Ivanov was thinking he could be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
But this mission was turned into another close-fashioned Dmitry Medvedev of Putin.
Mr. Putin, three years later, he was president before he returned to his office.
The star of the criminal Minds series, Thomas Gibson, was shot after he hit the manufacturer.
Gibson, a physical fight in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who were responsible for the design of the directory, reported that they were fired from their jobs in a joint statement.
The Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, who showed up at Gibson before his funeral, published an apology on Saturday.
There were differences and inconsistencies about the creation of the Sette.
One of them said, "I'm sorry about what happened."
In ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, a group of characters played by Gibson will be given a date in advance of the detailed information on how to get out of a program that monitors the FBI agent.
Previously on Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old actor who took part in the Dharma & Greg status comedy, was still taking part in this program since the first season of 2005.
Gibson said to a brain released on Friday, "I love the criminal Minds, and I've been working with him for 12 years."
I'd like to stay until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the authors, the actors, our great team and the best supporters that can have a program.
The program is expected to return to screens on 28 July for the twelfth season.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
A man living in the Banff area was found helping to identify the fish that emerged in the Banff garden.
Kevin Bain thinks this 75 fish can be fish that are transported with my sea turtle.
Bain, who lives some 500 metres away from the sea, published her images in Periscope in hopes of keeping fish light in two inches long.
Queensferry Passed: The top is now connected to Fife
The $1.35 billion project must be completed by May 2017
Scientists have combined the north and the west of Queensferry, and this means that your brain is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four gates between "table fans" on each of the three corners of the neck.
The cut from Fife is 600 meters long and 30,000 tons weight.
10,000 tons of lead and 20,000 tons of concrete are made of 46 support cables.
The $1.35 billion project must be completed by May 2017.
Economicsman Keith Brown was one of the first people to walk across the street, visiting today's treasures.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in Queensferry's construction.
We're all witnessing to the design of concrete on 30,000 tons of concrete just to build this part of our brain.
Despite the potential size and weight of the closed cell space between the circle table and Viyaduk, it was a sensitive process that required the final level of tolerance for this application.
As a general rule, in the case of almost 79 % of the total table table, the first piece of the table's concrete dome will be carried out in Rossyth today, and this means that the whole table will be ready to be removed on top of the table.
Forth Gočit and High Commissioners Project Director Michael Martin said: "The first door is always moving within a very important mile.
In this adventure project, this gate represents the advance in construction engineering.
After the establishment of the last Royal Table and the connection to the extended North School level, we had to close the space on the north-or the Kara.
This was done by drawing up to 700 millimetres in the north.
It was so big but it was a very sensitive process at the same time.
The reason for its growth was that at 222 meters long, it was almost 6,000 tons of weight and it had to be cut at about 3% level.
The reason for this feeling was that the team was not very low on tolerance values; both sides were only a few millimetres.
Whatever it's all about.
Moelfre Körfze rescue team: Three men are lucky 'because they're alive'
Three men were lucky for their lives after they fell off the fishing boat in England.
Moelfre RNLI's air-conditioning station, announced at 13:20 on Friday after seeing Moelfre Körfezi's funeral, was announced by English writing hours.
Three men were trying to cross a safe area while the boats continued their own way.
Moelfre's cancer control officer said, "We've seen the train draw them straight, and we've been worried."
He said: "What is the matter with us, that we were not going to send them away until they are guided?"
When two people were rescued from a local fishing boat, the third man in his 60 ’ s was caught in an accident without having to eat.
All of them were taken to a lifeboat and brought to a lifeboat station.
Mr. Jones said, "It's lucky that the three men who came down to you were alive and never hurt.
There was an emergency stop cable in the train engine, but when the ship was being taken off, it must have landed in some way from the person who used the boat.
Some of these three men were watching today.
A type of fishing that is valuable to health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world changes.
It's been a sad situation for many people over the past ten years that we've been so sad about not going out to play games anymore.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move out of the canyon.
When you spent your attention on screens, you were exposed to video games and finally smart phones when you were confined to your head TV.
That's why it's really great to see that technology and open air move are not external elements.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, an application that was created for the main video game in the 1990s (which later became a line line line, cards and other side products).
Like a lot of populace culture, this new game became part of the world when it was served in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of the year.
Later, overloaded services were provided in other countries because of the concern of the authorities.
In days Pokémon Go Tinder reached the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
If you need to explain briefly, players get smart phones, go out to Pokémon, followed by GPS, and they can 'draw photos' (by taking a picture on your phone) or 'caught'.
The game was played by a generation of young men and women who were playing on the stage.
The game in the U.S. has provided a valuable increase in the number of actions that a "intervention" person has taken every day.
Cardiogram, an application developed for Apple Watch and followed by 35,000 users, said among the people who had followed Washington Post in the last two days before the use of the game, that every day the person who did 30 days without exercise increased from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; it's only able to see the data at the free level.
Many public health campaigns, which promote "30 minutes" of people, "up from the canepe" and "every day" have been observed because of the complexity of the public health message and the contact by people who appear to be missing.
But it doesn't matter how important your exercise is.
It usually reduces the risk of cancer or depression by people who do not exercise.
It provides assistance in such matters as regular, kilo-control, high-tanning and diabetic, and has a long list of advantages that cannot be listed here.
But Pokémon Go's beauty is to get out to do something that's amazing.
In this way, there are also three basic elements of health: movement, clean air and sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the hunt.
As always, there are un-fixed players who are going to complain about something.
And someone can knock on the door while walking.
What's the difference?
It's a big news event.
Although we've been watching smart phone programs like Fitbit, there's no reason why we're using this game.
The effect of youth will be over and my use will slow down over time.
But Pokémon's success will result in many games that will help people become more active, formal and healthy by combining their applications and visual reality with the activities in the real world.

Simone Billes has got the gold medal in her evaluation of the Gymnastic General
Forget the press.
Forget about your breath.
Simone Billes has forgiveness for all of this.
It's dynamic about playing.
It's money on the sound device.
Surprisingly with the earth.
It's perfect under the head.
And he's now an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnastics, who first completed the general assessment of Friday, made a clear distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina, a friend of the "Son Five" group, took 62,198 points.
A woman in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Green Olympics, organized by Simone Biles, Brazil, from the United States, performed performance in the sea at the end of the artistic Jimnastic General Assessment.
Billes became the fourth and fifth American woman who received the general assessment of her background and probably heard her name as the best of her own generation and perhaps all the time.
When the last group was released, it was wrapped in their eyes, and this mother was on a long journey to reach.
This success led to the same level of athletes as Michael Phelps in every generation that can reach new levels:
Billes has spent the last three years at the 15th World Championship on gold and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has been one of the most successful in this sport with the racing routines that have been called "the best gymnastics I've ever seen."
A final test was waiting for him in Brazil; this was between him and Billes and the other people in the area who were too busy to be with him and the big waiters.
Texas, it would be a disappointment that a family in Spring would be able to return home with less gold than a gold medal.
From the United States, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, edited in Brazil in 2016 by Rio de Janeiro Writes Olympics, followed by the general evaluation of artistic gymnastics women, and after receiving money, Pershembe, Aö.
Billes, the first international team coordinator, who was elected, won the Saturday day that Martha Karoliy performed as a sign of honour at his party.
It's not exactly right if you don't look forward to it this long run.
Part of the tour of the land is also equipped with Latin music that will provide a complete fit for Rio Olympic Arena outside the square.
It's not an accident.
A girl discovered by Boorman's mother became a force during a journey to a gym performed by Aimee Boorman when she was a child by her grandmother and her father.
Since 2013, this has not lost any of the general evaluations; it is a series of gynecology that needs to continue as long as you want to know.
It was a pasta if Mustafin was led on two rotations.
Billes has not yet been trained as a seaman and a non-expert.
It went into the ocean with 15,433 points, and it crossed with 15,933 points in your space.
Raisman, waiting for the last point, was bitten by the punishment, and when Billes' vision of a painting was true, he gave his eyes around the bright red, white, and blue eyes.
Raisman's performance was like his four-year-old performance, but then he lost the bronze medal to Mustafina four years ago.
This time, the 22-year-old U.S. team captain named "nine."
In time, a suspect returned to his place of residence, where he later sent a kiss to the rest of them.
And for 19-year-old Billes this week, the very shared tweet that he threw at the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: Three victims were shot when they listened to music in the car
At the first serial murder of Phoenix in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the car when they spoke and listened to music according to police reports published on Friday.
The authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter were shot in a garage car parked on a 12-Haziran street.
The report shows that when the gunman is standing on the side of the vehicle, he shoots eight hands on the ground and runs away from another vehicle.
The police say these three murders don't seem to be targeted because the attackers didn't get their handbags or $2,900 money.
Phoenix police spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, said that the investigators of the armed attack were aimed at investigating whether it was related to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period of pregnancy, seven people were killed in a total of nine attacks by Spanish miners, and two were injured.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, found out to KPHO about CBS, "It happened in the area of my apartment in front of a house."
By the end of the 1990s, the suspect is thought to have used several vehicles containing black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln at the end of the 1990s.
The investigators refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same murder and that they were committed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital because of his injuries and later lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah lost her life at the scene.
A man who was a witness there told the police they were sitting in a park car and they said they weren't supposed to listen to music.
At the same time, the authorities published a police report on the use of an empty truck in three and a half hours before the murder.
Researchers found mermaids, pulled a mermaid out of a chair, and identified the mermaids in the engine division.
The mother of a six-year-old microsopharynx patient: "She's getting something better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Piccito likes to sing, play, and of course he loves his mother.
But there's a microcephalic disorder in Edmund, instead of the screens; it's a genetic disorder that her mother didn't know about during Elizabeth Piccito's pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't want that.
He said: Of course it is not true, and of course it is.
He told Vincent himself and his wife that Edmund could never know them and that he could not even live.
Some doctors went so far as to offer me an investment in my house.
Piccito found out in the statement "My first reaction was to say that I don't think people are doing this anymore."
Edmund can walk with a driver's help.
Edmund didn't sit tight until he was three years old or he couldn't get up and still talk.
But she's getting to some point of turn.
He can walk and build a bike by helping.
Also, he likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund lied about for "sing me sing."
Piccito told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But it's not a sign language as we know it's saying that Edmund lied to his own signs.
Microsopharyngeals may occur with a number of different circumstances; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and may be caused by infections caused by such viruses as Zika during pregnancy.
The signs and symptoms of illness can be very different.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected by this situation.
Piccito remembers the emotional burden that the uncertainty of the future creates.
I was wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't know that yet.
Actually, I haven't asked anyone for a long time since I really didn't expect anyone to tell me about it.
However, Piccito will be able to provide reliable advice for mothers of babies born with Zika.
He's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Louisiana has been running the rescue teams of rain and water pressure relief teams in Mississippi.
The rain and the floods in Louisiana were aimed at reducing the demand for more rain by Friday, with the expectation that it would be more than possible on Friday.
The National Air Status Services reported that in the north of Louisiana and in the south of Mississippi, there were numerous floods, and that it threatened the public water pressure after the rains.
Louisiana Valisiana John Bel Edwards said that government authorities were constantly in contact with local authorities and that they were on the way to support situations affected by the situation.
Mike Steele, head of the Office for Internal Security and Emergency Status, said he was found in requirements for high water vehicles, boats and superpowers.
Steele just said that it was required for the Tangapahoa Hall for tons of hyperactivity.
Most of Louisiana's water pressure will be applied on Saturday.
The air-conditioning services indicated that there could be as much water as three or five in a brain area.
There was a water pressure on Saturday in South Alabama, where the rains continued in the Mobil area.
Both of them are expected to reach record levels within a week at the Amite Network near the Baton Rouge Committee and at Denham Springs.
H.E. Mr. Alek Krautmann said he could leave many homes under water in the bathing areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the water pressure in the Ascension Hall created a threat to the flow of water from the riverbed of Maurepas.
Liverpool, located right south of the Mississippi state border in Louisiana, was already at the highest level on 9 a.m.
The rescue teams continue to rescue people from the water pressure in the Amite and Wilkinson disaster, which is located in the south of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son, was among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from the Beaver River, 400 feet away from his home, usually rose rapidly during the night.
Another widow who was sitting next to her said that her son was warning her.
Hansford said, "We woke up and kept coming to the water."
He was coming to know me.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level she'd seen here for 48 years.
Hansford said that he and his family were disabled and that he was the only one who could heal.
Hansford said that the three of them were working in the emergency and that they saved a large, military truck and took them to the station on Friday at Gloster.
Krautmann said that as rain rains continued, the water pressure "proceeded to spread" and that the authorities were planning to issue a decree.
Krautmann said that one of Livingston's monitors reported that there were 13.75 floods from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said this land was still in a high-level state since Wednesday.
The authorities, the rain rains and the floods left under the water pressure said that there was a need for the rescue of the residents of Tangapahoa Mahalles and the graduation of the schools in five school districts.
A woman from the CBS said a woman in Tangapahoa said that she was under the pressure of 200 houses.
The residents were taken to the two churches that were in exile, but these are under the water pressure right now.
Mahalle Sirumulus Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals because of high water.
In the city of Amiti and Hammond, shelters were opened for people who had been denied asylum.
He said, "When they are sent back, they will be allowed to return to their homes."
In the Hammond district of Tangipahoa Mahalles, there were almost two levels of closure due to high water, and there were cases of overcrowding by residents who were trying to keep water from their homes and businesses.
The city manager Lacy Landrum said, "The last major water pressure we've ever lived was in March."
It's like it's gonna happen.
In Mississippi, Harrison's Emergency Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy Körfez said the rain continued in a quiet way.
On Saturday, he said that you were told that you had a water pressure in several homes, but he said there was no notification in this regard for Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of the Shopper Value Foods at Amiti, lives in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water in places I've never seen before," and he added, "and there's still rain."
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, saved his life from Philadelphia's attack.
The police explained that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second one that a 6-year-old boy was shot in this city this week.
CBS has identified Mahaj Brown's grandfather and grandfather for Philadelphia.
His grandmother and his grandfather Brown said that there was more than one gun wound in the body, the bone, the bone, the arm, and the body in the areas where he was involved, but when he was brought to the hospital, his science was in place.
His grandmother, Delores Melindaz, found out at the station, "He's been so sad and he's been mad at his little ass."
I can't believe it.
The boy was listed among those who kept his critical condition in the hospital and passed some operations.
The family told the station that they were waiting for her to get better.
The first class was going to start at the local high school.
Brown was among the four who were shot in the Germantown area.
The two of them were both 32 years old and two men were shot.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the men aged 29 was critical and the other two were stable.
The station, the boy, said that one of the 29-year-olds who was critical of his situation was hit by a car in front of a seat.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the wounded has been attacked.
Detectives said CBS Philadelphia could have shot one another by more than one weapon.
The scene was filled with war weaponry weapons of various sorts.
Looks like it's been a long time.
There were troops on both sides of the range and my removal.
This also shows that more than one weapon has been found and both are active," Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
More than one house and vehicle were destroyed in the area.
There was no arrest, and the police were told they were tracking their security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot by her hand in front of her house on Saturday at the West Oak station.
He's still looking for a suspect during his recovery.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
This year I gave this name to the Women's Olympic Games, and there's more than one reason for it.
First of all, since 1984, I've been involved in all the Scripture Olympics, and the U.S. has never been so impressed before.
And second, this team has three gymnasiums that inspire many girls with different ethnic origins: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernández.
The construction of this team, brought together by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, honors everyone.
Well, finally, it's kind of like America.
At the same time, it strengthens the presence of black and Latin women of origin at the top levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first woman has always been an African-born American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in sequences 1 and 2.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a wonderful Olympic champion and he supported himself.
Simone Billes, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who are now the world's three World Championships, will be able to testify to the potential performances of the Jimnastic routines that have been performed in the past.
On Friday, Simone became the fourth American behind the gold medal when women were generally prized.
And my team friend Aly Raisman also won a silver medal.
We know this sport for the best time, but it doesn't look like it at the gymnasiums in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Ali and Madison to get a place in the Olympics.
The reason for being "Son Fashli" is that only four Gymnastics will be found in the next Olympic team, and this is the last year that Martha Karoliy's training is going to take place.
But indeed, a very financial sport and gymnastics are working in the education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasians and families) and special gymnasium clubs that support more fees.
Most of these gymnasiums will support these operations, taking place in existing bathrooms.
These clubs need a financial and long-term support for the families of the Gymnastics, the only place that the Gymnasians can learn.
Simone Billes' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's partner, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since they started gambling.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie's number of young girls are more expensive and accessible to the public than they can afford.
I built my own gym class 20 years ago.
In my institutions, Harlem is centrally charged with free, low-cost and low-cost Gymnastic education for young people (principally, black and Spanish) and we are offering national and international seminars.
In June, we're going to expand to Detroit (the area where I grew up) on learning this great Olympic sport and giving young people the opportunity to take advantage of it.
It develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and provides regular physical work, discipline and determination.
This combination, health, school and success will provide long-term advantages.
Thousands of young girls are going to be inspired by this team and this is a great thing.
I'm involved in sports activities, especially for girls.
We're really going through exciting times.
They thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for bringing gold to the Olympic team and for having clearly demonstrated "The Power of Girls" and motivated many young girls with different background plans to be a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue the seizures.
The observers hoped that the agreement with the United Kingdom Tabilers was going to end after the massacre, but 58 percent of the assistant doctor who participated in the vote had played no.
In December, Mr. Hunt, NHS, explained the plans for the application to deal with the fact that "no one has any power" and that it would be too late to harm the staff and the patients.
In order to improve care beyond normal hours, the First Assistant Medical Group has reached a new agreement on changes in working hours at night and at weekends.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Vice-President of the BMA's Medical Committee, said last night: "Asian doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement; in particular, they think that it will affect the current labour force crisis and that I am not the same as all doctors."
The first doctor group should only be able to make progress during this period of eight weeks and on time to complete.
The efforts made by the BMA to resolve the disagreement have also been addressed by the government's lack of interest in the establishment of an interaction and, in some cases, by a voter.
This is a development, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that the door of the past month will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to get into action immediately, remove my surgery and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
Auxiliary doctors say they're ready to increase their work delays while they're not doing this.
At the end of the month of Nisan, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 meetings were held, and nurses and speakers were required to look after the doctors at the grav line.
The observers hoped that the agreement with the United Kingdom of England would end after the agreement had been reached in Mutababata.
BMA wants to make the deal better at the weekend's fees for 54,000 assistant doctors.
NHS Executive Director Daniel Mortimer invited assistive doctors to apply any seizures.
Mr. Mortimer said to them: "Grev does not solve anything but trouble, anxiety and stress for patients, caregivers and families who are currently on the team and services."
Over the past two months, we have had discussions with the Assistant Doctors' Committee, and we have approached health care and other authorities in a way that is relevant to their concerns about the Position of the Supervisory Authority and the Immunization.
The experts hoped that there would be an indication of how serious this could be done by the British School of Education and Health.
Medicine to remove the risk of heart disease from the center of the crisis with 2€ per day
Thousands of heart disease will benefit from 2$ of medication a day after it is proposed to be given to more people over a longer period of time.
Ticagrelors that prevent bleeding are reducing the risk of the crisis for those who have heart problems.
The drug was administered for 12 months following the heart crisis and reduced the risk of stroke or another crisis.
NHS monitor, NICE, suggested that this be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS monitor, Nice, suggested that it be given to people over four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year about 150,000 people in England experience heartbreaking crises, and four of them experience another crisis or crisis.
The cause of heart crises and floods is the formation of roofs in more and more walls of water materials.
If the plague is broken, this may be the cause of a heart attack and a heart attack.
And if you get out of the clean place, you're going to get blood flow, and you're going to have to stop your blood flow.
There's a higher risk of someone who's been hit by a crisis before.
This risk is reduced by Tiacagrelor, created by the United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca by Brilique ticari, which reduces the risk of corruption.
The NICE vaccine table published today suggests that 90 mg of taggrelor should be given to humans for 12 months and that it should be administered twice daily with aspirin for three years later.
Professor Carole Longson, head of NICE Health Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the existence of two-year prevention treatments, four other heart attacks or accidents occur in the heart of those who experience heart attacks and are generally the consequences of them being devastating."
The fear of rebirth is that we can create an effect on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that the use of ticagrelor with aspirin is a factor in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke in people who have had a heart attack before.
We are pleased that the thousands of people waiting for Ticagrelo to benefit from it have increased their treatment options.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelolor has been available for three years - mainly at risk of cancer, the plan of surgery is not available after this period.
PC culture increased voice failure in Muslim areas
The former Tower of Hamlets was taken from the office of President Lutfur Merciful, because of his failure to follow the government's report last year
As today's corrupt government report shows, the political culture of truth has been followed by a widespread lack of vote in Muslim communities.
Former Captain Sir Eric Pickles, because of "extreme sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion", the police, electoral observers and the media have been following up on the evidence of electoral sensitization.
The secretary of the former population and the anti-road crime scene of our day said that the electoral system had to be shut down with religious needs so badly that the police had to be allowed to vote outside their cabinets to protect the fearful voters.
He suggested that the voters should be present with them in order to prove their identity during the vote.
In the current state, it's enough to specify the name and address of the selection.
The report suggests that in order to prevent people from giving their vote twice during the voting process, it is recommended that the fingers be firmly pushed.
Sir Eric said those in the news should be better protected.
He called for better access to the Press in relation to decisions of committees, committees and non-official working groups.
"This is not only the protection of honesty in elections, but also the protection of the local government from the lack of access to it and the culture of wealth," he said.
The report was prepared by Downing Street after the moon scandal in East London of Tower Hamlets.
In the past year, a special election court has decided to take over the role of Prime Minister Lutfur Raman after his infamous and illegal applications.
The Court found that the Most Gracious had given the Muslim people their religious rights, and that those who held themselves in disdain and held them responsible for their crimes.
It has been said that the Beneficent Allah has carried out His campaign on the basis of a religion which is based on the fact that it is a duty of the Muslims.
It was a game of up to 300 or it was the end of my use of identity, i.e., the use of voice as if it were something else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of honesty in the country.
He warned himself, especially about the shortcomings in the voice mail, where it was said that the old Muslim community was using pressure to vote on the island.
Sir Eric, there are some steps he has taken to modify the voting system in order to prove who people are on his side.
The report included the following words: "Some ethnic minority groups have received evidence that they are particularly worthy of being women and young people, especially in Pakistan and Bangladesh, to vote in favour of the will of the elderly.
"There were concerns about this kind of behaviour due to the ethnic origin and excessive anti-religious sensitivity of state institutions."
Sør Eric has suggested 50 measures to prevent political activists from working with the "oy assembly" purpose of e-mailing the system.
The report drawn up by Theresa May also calls for the tightening of record controls to prevent the use of the electoral book for the purpose of preventing the transfer and social aid shortage.
Whether the selection should prompt before the vote is taken.
After the vote, to prevent any person from voting twice, it's to be applied firmly to the hands of the person's hands after the vote.
Whether systematic checks are performed on the person's accordion to determine whether a vote is appropriate.
A 3-year limitation application that aims to ensure automatic voicemailing is used.
Political campaign officials and activists are under the law to take care of the conditions of the games sent by mail and mail sent by mail.
Police, it's not possible to get your voice command around.
In 1983, the Law was amended to facilitate the prosecution of terrorism in the context of the 1983 Convention on Human Rights.
Whether or not to take a photo in their vocal cords is illegal.
It's only the need to speak English in their vocal cords (except Galler).
Whether the staff will be strengthened by the training they have received regarding the implementation of the law on entry into the office of election.
Sir Eric, the Tower of Hamlets, said that there was no "injurious" crime at the time of the Tower of Hamlets.
He said, "The Court of the choice has ruled that there is no way to be blamed for the wrongdoing and illegal acts committed by the Beneficent Allah and His Messenger."
He was found guilty in front of the macho suspect, according to the purpose of his madness.
At the same time, he also conducted "cool marking checks" that are not active in the electoral records departments of his prison.
Sir Eric said to them: "Tower Hamlets' annual court decision was a warning.
Although our country has the power to create the mother of parliaments, this concern may be due to the spread and rejection by some institutions of secret electoral failures.
Kate's bike simulator and Rio Olympics are crazy for other popular characters
This week, Rio 2016 Olympics, French biker Pauline Ferrand-Provot, who proved to be an effective candidate for Cambridge Dhaes.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only one who looks at the fames while fighting for gold medals; at least social media thinks so.
That's why, the top of all the famous games we saw in Rio Games and our screens, the FC, Hollywood, has prepared a list of Olympics that look like they're after them.
Killer and Kurt: U.S. Men's Education Team member Brady Ellison (left), compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's bicycle belt, many people in the translator environment have shown that one can be equal to Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Reading Team member Brady Ellisson posted on Twitter after he released photos describing the star of the Money Player's movie.
And the poet acknowledged that since his childhood he's been told that he's been like Leo.
Brady told Huffington Post, "I don't think it's a big thing except my hair and my beard."
'He's a nice man, so I think that's a pleasure.'
London is one of London's most popular comparisons in 2012, and there is no doubt more similar to this year: The unbelievably similar to the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, a long-distance English sportser, Greg Rutherford.
Russian Gymnastics Aliya Mustafina was said to be like American artist Gloria Estefan from Cuba with great and meaningful eyes.
And in the water, South African facer Cameron van der Burgh, who has been like Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Changes: This user means Nathan's Home Film Star is an 'Athletic Version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett are compared to each other for a long time.
The Russian team's silver medalist face, actress Annalynne McCord, says that the fans of the U.S. team, who have the same bronze and red hair with the same actress Annalynne McCord, have referred to the "Joseph Gordon Levitt" by Nathan Adrian from the United States team.
Strong women: The football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a face and eyes like a face
Not only: One Twitter user and others were so happy to discover this similarity
One theory left in the air: This user thinks that this couple might be behind something like me.
One Twitter user, who heard about "the fact that the Internet thinks it's like Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's double."
In fact, the U.S. football star and the actress who plays in Dexter has hundreds of faces and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jengings is the actress Laura Linney's smile almost the same as that of another gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, the star of the Youth Fire star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Spiker apologized for the fact that China's face was 'dead like a dozus'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth quarter of Ai Yanhan's 14-year-old free race was very disturbing to those who watched the CBC's live Olympics on Wednesday.
The Canadian press organization CBC, one of the specters, was forced to apologize for the fact that China's 14-year-old face had gone off like a bad smell and that it had died like a douz.
Spiker Byron MacDonald, women thought that the microphone was closed when they started explaining their thoughts at the end of the free race.
MacDonald, who was involved in breaking up with the CBC's spy team, was told: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese was pregnant, my baby.'
He was too excited, he went swimming like a bad smell and died like a dog.
Thank you for that.
Chinese Colonel Ai Yanhan (14), finished the second round of the summer competition at 1:57.79, gave Canada's Taylor Rack a break between the Canadians and China within 1.61 seconds.
Canadian monitors moved quickly after they became surprised by the tone and language they used
Emmett Macfarlane said "CBC spy said that his 14-year-old face was dead like a dog" in the form of a tweet.
He wasn't aware you were still in the open."
China Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 m in Freedom Bay War, was identified as 'The 14-year-old little Chinese was pregnant, baby.'
On Twitter, the events about Byron MacDonald were published in a very harsh and fast way, and many of them were on their own.
Twitter users didn't keep themselves when Byron Macdonald heard how unsensitive Byron Macdonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Vay #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you're why we all look like a runner.
In a short time, Scott Russell, who published CBC, apologized for the disappointment of MacDonald: "We are sorry for the way in which it was published in the face of the conflict."
"These are indeed the words which have been chosen without any doubt, and indeed, you are sorry that such a thing has happened."
CBC is in a position to apologize at least 90 times more than the people who tweeted as a result.
Another spy, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize for MacDonald's name.
CBC later copied this to his Twitter user on 90 complaints about MacDonald's findings.
The network issued an explanation, asking for an apology.
We want to express our sincere regret over the fact that these statements are found and published.
Last night, in public, we apologized to our observers, to our social media, and to our followers.
We'd like to explain that Byron's content was not the person of the face but the performance.
At the same time, these were highly inappropriate and disrespectfully chosen words, and byron's last regret for what they said.
On Friday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized in the press and said he didn't want to be in a personal attack.
He said, "I want to apologize for a situation I've been doing after the evening of the Olympics."
"I'm not a face-to-face person, I've been in the performance. "
'I don't need any more words, I didn't want to be disrespectful, and I'm so sorry.'
The primary customer is the woman who is trying to commit an intrusion into the middle of the store
The customers didn't know what a woman would do when she took out her clothes to try a trip in the middle of Primark.
Worse yet, the woman looked at what she looked like, took it out and put it back on.
He went on to look at it and then tried four internships at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried to travel before she was rehabilitated was a Primark store located at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who were at the store at the time, said after trying to find out the secret woman's pocket, she'd been dressed again and gone out of the store without getting anything.
He said to them: "The eyes of men did not believe."
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a drink from the wine and put on his coat and pants.
'He wasn't trying to find a special place to do this, he was standing in the middle with all due respect.'
'When he was leaving, everyone looked at him and realized that he didn't like the trip because he was putting his back on it again.'
He tried three more shoes until he decided he didn't like anything and then he went out of the store again.
"Those who looked at themselves didn't seem to care, and they didn't think they'd buy any more of the trips they were trying to make."
Ms. Davidson (33) living in Kent said, "It's a shame to think that someone else's wearing a clean and clean ride will go home."
This event happened after Saturday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added, 'I think that after that day, your person found his clothes and bought them for sale, that's a good situation.'
'When I took a new trip home, it was really bad to think that someone else was wearing it and coming to me without a shower.'
A Primark speaker said: 'Primmark, 9 August Saturday is aware of what happened in our store in Folkestone.'
It's an interesting product. It's removed from the sale.
How can you protect yourself from the attacks of Krav Maga?
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you to be more secure.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, head of the New York Central Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with nearby armed predators.
This video will show you how you can turn your condition to the side of the river.
Mizarachi says when you get near behind you, you see what you have to do first and you're going to get your face turned around and you're going to 'open the fire line'.
Then you'll shoot your face with your arms in front of your arms and your arms between your shoulders.
Then, when you draw your foot against them, they shall go up on both sides, and you shall draw out a sword at this time, and turn your hand against them, and shall strike them with the edge of the sword, and you shall stand up against them.
When an armed person comes near, he's got a similar technique; you turn your body off the fire and you turn your weapon into a way that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, He will draw out his weapon from the sky and strike you with it, and then you will return to it.
Does he seem attractive?
Look at the video to see how Mirrachi did this.
But do not forget that if you are not the master of the Qur'an, you will have to pay the most secure way out of every race.
Traveling Ian Wright took the language to the worst places in Europe for the guide
The English tour carried out a serious test of forgiveness and education by lying about some of Europe's worst and cruelest places.
The server and travel writer, Suffolkluklu Ian Wright (51), called an Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circuit Square, a train tubing button, and a mobile phone in Russia.
He used a lymometer to show himself and what kind of work he's doing for us before he lied about anything.
But the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong tried some amazing results.
Although the idea of lying at a train station used by thousands of people is the last level of hatred, there is actually much worse bacteria in the lungs.
Mr. Wright, during his journey to Europe, he met doctors and surgeons about the growth and health of the mede bacterium.
Whatever it was, it did not create any effect except by the evil of its own mouth.
Mr. Wright, he was known to test the stability of his brain by eating strange and strange things.
This task has certainly tested the delivery system in a wide range of ways from general train stations to the wave symphony buttons.
In a film about this, he said, "I haven't been very careful about my health since I was a child, and I've kept my mouth shut from the ground, the left and the right water."
In the course of the film, it clearly proved the reason for this.
The only thing he refused was a bad general toilet in Russia.
The version showed the lymometer number on the 4,000 degrees.
If there's to be comparisons, this number must be under 60 in the newly depleted area.
But a Russian general toilet that refused to lie when there was less than 60 lymometers on the basis of 4000 degrees.
Mr. Wright and Fin milk production producer Valio, showed the number of bacteria in different places like bathrooms, the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong
He said in his own movie, "Come close to being one of the worst things I've ever smoked in this bathroom."
There's nothing worse than this!
I'm not gonna lie to anything because you're mad at her.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong, finished with the producer Valio.
The company has provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, containing vitamins C and D that help to strengthen the immune system along the lines of lactic acid bacteria.
Valio's Exploitation, Fruit Waters and New Categories Division, Deputy Prime Minister Niko Vuorenma said to him: "We really wanted to ask doctors something new.
It's an interesting thing to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
Finally, we've done a lot of crazy brainstorms in the middle of "Let's call Ian."
They claim that health concerns have become a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about products, we just wanted to put the products in a much larger bond, the good and bad bacteria around us every day, the importance of health and the connection to the immune system.
Mede health concerns are becoming a global phenomenon, and we would be able to give more information to the public about this situation in a way that is interesting.
At the same time, I think you're showing us that we have a great understanding of the film!
Tom Hakala, who was in charge of the film, added: "Ian, if I had lied about some of the things I wanted to lie about him like a Russian TV show in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Of course, lying to some things was easy for Ian, but some were very difficult.
I'm glad we got some of these bad lies.
A poll conducted by Valio in 2015 linked 84 percent of participants to the health of lactic acid bacteria and 58 percent indicated that the products containing lactic acid bacteria were used at least indirectly.
The family of Maganda, before the wedding, studied the Cornwall social account
A magany family lost $50,000 in social affairs, which they were threatened with if they needed it.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife Shaun Trebilcock were fired from the Cornwall account after a number of complaints.
When they were forced to leave the country, they were surprised to see that the authorities were unable to remedy the situation.
And there were great earthquakes in the wall; and great signs were cast out, so that it fell upon the earth; and written on the wall a book written on it.
The family has now been removed from the account and it is considered to be using the special location options
Cornwall Housing account manager Donna McEvoy expressed his fear that the situation could not be saved.
He said to them, 'This is what I think is really stupid for the people here, and people don't have to live this way.
There's a lot to be counted because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living in the interstate, and the police said it was a terrible behavior for me to fight with a white ball in the street, to scare the people nearby, to use drugs, to sell drugs and overcrowding, to argue and to deny.
In the month of the visit, an anti-social action decision was made for Skeldon (47) named after the Kira Agreement.
There are old rubbish bins in many rooms in the house that was supposed to be burned
In the past, drug dealers have been removed from state-of-the-art storage tables.
The neighbors said they saw what they were fighting in the street and that the police were frequenting it.
Cornwall Houseing, who had been extended for 11 weeks to be transferred voluntarily, forced him and his wife to leave this country this week.
He was happy to be treated with kindness by calm neighbors who said that their lives had turned upside down.
One person said, 'No one was in his age.'
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You can't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because there was no voice; we weren't used to it!
They're gone, everything's gonna be great now.
Cornwall Houseing's neighboring construction mission, Adam Fitzpatrick, said he didn't cooperate with his family's local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the government often called the police.
Old and empty games on social media
He added: 'The employer's own and the family's welfare is really embarrassed that he doesn't have any responsibility; it's always been the last choice Cornwall Houseing has made for him.
This was a very difficult time because of the extreme level of conduct and the fear that neighbors should not witness.
I am very grateful for the efforts of my team, Devon and Cornwall Police Forces and the members of the community who are particularly interested in informing us.
I hope that this development will be understood as a message that will provide a great deal of comfort to our neighbors and will not be shown any favor in anti-social behavior.
Mr Fitzpatrick said he had three sons living in the state at different times but he was 20 years old.

In 2014, the police owned more than 70 grams of land, supplies, special goods, and $1700.
Skeldon, for sale, was sentenced to money after he accepted the charge for finding a drug in Class B.
In 2013, Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car accident, claimed that he would use the money to get a desk for a car accident.

A low-flight military aircraft crashing over a train immediately over the train station in Port-au-Prince
Portuguese tourists in Aveiro have lived their lives in shock
Portuguese Air Force aircraft P-3C Orion flew from low to low
Air forces have shown that this is a flight of education, but it has become urgent that security risks are not found
It's when tourists start panicking over the low-flight jet crowd.
The Dramatic Visions show nearly the army approaching at the level of contact to those who have sundry over the river Aveiro in northern Porteiz.
And before they could see what was going on between the clouds they were worried about what was happening to them because they realized that they had been created by jet engines.
Well, after dinner, Aveiro came to the funeral in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few tattoos that shared the video of a recent plane, said, "Two times it really went down and seemed like a hit on a point."
Nono Arroja added, 'I was surfing, and I swear I felt like I'd fall on the plane.'
The tourists in the village of Aveiro were shocked when the plane from the darkness began to fly into my fallen arm
The Portuguese Air Force explained that today the P-3C Orion aircraft is on a training flight to identify the fishing boats in the coastal area and that it is the only way to control them.
He said that because of the recent cessation of power from power, it was apparent that the jets were more likely to fly than usual, but the air forces were too strict about the safety of no one's safety.
This letter, the powerful news of the closure, greatly impressed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland and caused the death of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces have expressed their concern that the pilot's vision should be lowered by reason of today's pressure on the pilot's vision.
He was in flight training and wanted to identify fishing boats from the pilot as part of his behavior
The London girl student who joined the Ishid was killed in Syria.
In the past year we were informed that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three English girls who left London, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnimie Akunjee said that Rakka had received information about her family's death in Syria a few weeks ago.
According to ITV News on Friday, he is thought to have died in a Russian air attack on Rakka that his group is strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and died when she was planning to return to Britain.
"We hope that this situation will help others to move into the war zones, and we hope that it will reduce people's risk of going to war areas as a means of transporting a table for others."
In February 2015, two girls from Sultana and East London flew to Turkey and then to the Syrian border.
She told Sultana's family that she was married to an ISED warrior in Syria and had been widows for months.
Reid indicated that while Clinton was elected, he would not leave Garland as High Court Island.
In the Senate, Democrats Leader Harry Reid expressed his belief that Judge Merrick Garland would be named after the High Court for the election of President Hillary Clinton of the Democratic Islands.
Since President Barack Obama's name appeared in March, the Senate's citizens were still preventing Garland's approval process.
Most of the Senate's leader Mitch McConnell, former High Court Judge Antonina Scalia, said he would choose another one.
Reid, in a visual conversation on Friday, said that Clinton believed he was going to choose Garland and "the reasons for this."
Later, a speaker named Reid said that he didn't really talk to Clinton and that he was in the show about not showing him his name.
He hit Garland and said that Clinton's team didn't want to "break up the situation" by making a new election.
Garland, Chief Justice of the U.S. Themiz Court of Justice, Columbia State.
Reid said that the Republicans who prevented Garland's name from being shown, the Republican president of the island, Donald Trump, were "sellers" and "manganese".
He said it wasn't appropriate for Trump's mission.
"Treats indicated that "for women as long as it's for women" is beyond my calendar.
The story of Treats works with photographer David Bellemera to publish an inspired calendar prepared by the 1970s by Pirelli.
But instead of famous and exciting people, they are working to find new generation group models for the 2017 N.N. Ilham Perilles calendar.
Treat's boss, Steve Shaw, said that this height, which was high at the beginning of this year, was different from the old Playboys because he said "playboy's for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Of course my calendar believes it's the same.
Shaw said in her paper on my calendar, "We need to go back to reassessing classical extremism so that women can view these images as a peaceful source of inspiration."
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful masterpiece.
Models can send photos as translators or participate in open meetings in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil target: Who really are the marketers?
The average age, only men love wine.
Let us say that this brain depends on the truth.
According to YouGov, the turning back of the posters, which are very much of a topic, is not the result of the Y-ray that created a physical object, but is the end of the middle age nostalgia.
In the near future, those who sell vinyl albums mostly between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24-year-old group is the lowest.
At the same time, it is not only the way interested people act; it is a sensitive preoccupation; older vinyl recipients usually like to keep their feelings to themselves (%56 and %53) and people who prefer to stay alone (%69 and %66).
And what about youGov's results?
This blog, if there was a news on television, in a crowd of Soho's cameras, walking with a bunch of greek clothes, watching a lot of ice before it stops and opening up my hands and saying something like this, "Let's take a look."
Then let's take a look.
There are still several scientific plaza shops with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases, while Soho's centre is losing its slow growth and uneven air.
I'd probably like to stop by the camera for a later part, and I'd like to keep up with the different men in some of these stores, and I'd try to inform them about their age and emotional circumstances.
From Sister Ray (one number: two young women, three middle-aged) I went to Reckless Records (one number: eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman) and looked at the store after breakfast for a meeting in London.
I'm asking if I'm a collector.
He says, "I think so."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates that are on top of the picture (the picture sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow myself up to my house) shake the walls of the sitting room.
So many albums and single collections are the result of a partial cost-effective comedy; they can now buy money that they don't have and buy back what they sold when they were young and unmet.
She says, "Many of the things I've got in my 60s are about 70s, I'm 11 or 12 years old; I'm too young to get it."
The market prefers only to stay in the areas where the market is concerned, and it adds: "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad mood.
Wez (25) who works at Sister Ray thinks that most of the customers he met were applying yourGov profile.
But she also realized that she had created a new wave of advertising from the media and that people who heard the fashion come back needed to buy back old plates.
At my meetings, I found out that in 1998 or 1999, people took out their collections.
First, customers sell their vinyls to buy CDs and then they sell their CDs to get back their plates."
This may explain the increase of certain elderly people who are reanimated by vinyl.
What about the emotional importance of the plates?
In a store like Phonica, it takes you a few seconds to realize that the plazas are like a peaceful crowd of people.
According to Wez, some grown-up clients have been able to pay off their calls.
Some vinyl addicts may want to escape from the digital world and from the memory of their youthful memories of their youth.
He says, "Sometimes it can be seen as a form of comfort to fill a void or material stuff."
I have this because I'm a collector, and I think it's a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social servants."
A survey conducted in the month of Nisan revealed that 50 percent of the vinyl albums we've been working on last month have not yet heard of.
At the same time, the pollet came out of the middle of a bottle that was never used by 41% and 7% had no plates.
In this news life, I've probably been looking at a series of new bosses.
The direction of this turn is an element distinguished by Jonny (42) who worked at Sounds of Universe.
"A short time ago, someone came to me and said, 'I don't have any plates, I just want to get a radiohead bill to put it on our face.'
This doesn't represent a great percentage, but it certainly brings about a state of existence.
More production, less music.
There's people who say, "I don't have the balls."
They're not old, they're young, they're late in their teens, they're new in this matter.
I can see that when I'm at Fopp, where I'm about to have a whole piece of paper for vinyl, it's very different.
At the age of 70, there were two, two, three, four, four, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, three, two, three, and three.
Although the latest part of Wild Beast (Wild Beast) above the atmosphere is spreading sex-induced pop instead of the quieter, it is good to see the difference between customers.
Not only does it look like it's only hard to solve psychological traumas that disturb them for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is on her way to Fopp for a few minutes and looks at the plates below.
He's just gone out to look at the viruses instead of making a deal.
He says he doesn't have a choice to make a pick-up collection if he doesn't have enough.
It's very financial.
It's easier to listen to music than to computers or other images, but the beauty of wine... is far from being drawn away by drinking like a loved one.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really nothing like it.
A store where my last stand inspired the new generation of vinyl chains: Urban Outfitters.
I'm looking for a group of young girls gathered around polaroid cameras in front of a discussion of a Crosley record game.
Left Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse and Fleetwood Mac have an airtight space filled with plates; plates are not available for a central collection; a modern and class combination.
No one looks; maybe it's just because it's a decoration purpose, it's so high that some won't be touched.
It's totally "a natural vinyl."
But the interesting thing about these things can mean that the sector earns more money and sends less customers to Soho's depth; there's no longer much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a more money and time-consuming demographic group spends more money on such luxury items as vinyl.
But my findings show that at least youGov's results are true in Soho plaza stores; the number of women in plaza stores or translation forums is actually not counted by female collectors and vinyl addicts.
These people probably work very hard at school or at offices.
These people definitely don't run out of the eyes of a 30-year-old television server looking at the eyes of middle-aged men who don't know anything.
Greenland’s doggy, the longest live mammals in the world - video news
Science has revealed that Greenland has the longest life span among the world's mammals.
Julius Nielsen, who was working on the cattle, said that the record was between 272 and 512 years old, and he said he belonged to a woman at five meters long.
The French court rejected the sale of stores in the jungle.
A court in France rejected the offer made by the Calais authorities in the jungle, where thousands of residents lived.
In this week's trial, the Calais authorities found that a total of 72 claims from basic food items sold by people in the state camp had been sold, cut by hair cuts or 50 cents (40p) compared to tea or several euros.
The Calais Valiígia said that these places should be destroyed because they created a non-taxable parallel economy and they took risks with new and hygiene.
The relief groups explained that the life of the court and restaurants was important, that state-supported institutions and that the free food provided by other groups were not sufficient for the growing excitement in the camp.
Well, they've been defending stores and restaurants that often depend on the people they need and that they provide free food.
A court in Lille stated that there was no legal basis for a person working in a 72-year-old store but that Calais Valise's concerns could be "not fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that there was a much greater role for people living in "the most dangerous neighborhoods" than drinking.
He said that these areas provided peace points for the volunteers and the volunteers.
The Young People’s Book Coffee, one of the most dangerous places in the world, offers 200 meals every day, provides English and French classes, and here it offers advice on how to treat a child without hundreds of lines in the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect this coffee for children.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that this closure process "some of these children under the age of eight will be a face to face."
On Friday, on Friday, the two-star organization, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, was expected to reach 9,000 people in the jungle (the highest number up to this day).
After the gold in Fiji's high school, Britain won a gold medal at a seven-year-old ragby championship
The active progress of Britain in Rugby 7 at the Championship, which was held on Friday with Fiji, ended after the 43-7th anniversary of the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave the first Olympic gold medal in each color for the race, passport, side name, support, escape lines, and cassette power.
In the post-war years, Britain has received the third silver medal of the day as a most unsatisfied comfort prize, and it can be proud of the efforts they have made to defeat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the 7th Olympic opening tournament.
At the beginning of the day, at the end of the day, seven or five more may have found them in the end after South Africa.
But yet, one of Fiji's guys in this shape could even trust a team of 15 people.
Although it's not very convincing, it may be comforting to think that Britain will have at least one British gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
By the time they worked with Ryan eight years ago, they had lost each game in Adelaide National Championship.
This time, they lost only one.
Although this feeling is painful, the progress shown is really surprising.
Fiji, made an exciting start, players, over the British invasion of the Great Britain team.
This was like running between Captain Tom Mitchell and the team, and the World Series champions went through the Osea Colinsaisao side 5-0.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came out from the right side with another number.
It was 12-0, and Great Britain couldn't reach any more.
Mitchell's great lawyer, Leone Nakarawa's third shot like a mountain, but that's all he's done to slow down Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalu made a number from the right side and Britain fell back 17-0.
When the first half ended in just one minute, Nakarawa made another number from the beginning.
Later, Vatemo Ravovoo flew across a number of powerful British agents.
With this number, the score is 29-0.
When a team was set up to play at the 7th Fiji Championship, it was like Britain was still trying to find out the basis for the work.
That's the way it's going down.
He made big changes between the Great Britain and closed the Fiji Bar; for four minutes, it was not a good development in the first half until Joshua Tuisova was able to play with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was in an experiment for Great Britain and tried to count from the left side to make the school 36-7, but he was in the hands of South Sea Judges who sang, sang, and danced.
It was really hard not to feel surprised at Fiji's approach to the end.
Maa Vilame also found the last additions to the Fiji game that didn't need to be hit in the last few minutes.
The Fijians started to celebrate when they stole the dome, and they took the way to my room in the middle of the Great Britain.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji won Japan by 20-5 at the end of the day, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a tough final encounter, and Britain went ahead with one number.
Kyle Brown, the first half of South Africa's team, and Dan Norton's second half of the actions taken by the rebel rebel movement.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who took his place in England in the first 15th century, was guaranteed a treasure and a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired their coaches to fight cancer
There will be no more sensitive gold medals in these games, and this also makes an important point.
From the beginning of the first sentence, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that it would be much more meaningful to remember that they won the bottom at Stacio and Lagoa.
There were three voices in the boat, as many as two people were pulling their knees; and the first women reached this level in England in this year's second gold Olympics, as well as the voice of the coach Robin Williams, were burning in the boat.
The authorities were very clear; this was their wife's 39th race of incompatibility.
When we see two great sports on the surface of the snow, it doesn't completely cover the purpose of the storm.
After every round of gold medals, there was a tower that was built with a desire for more gains, and no hand was effective as long as 30 months ago when the cancer was inflicted on them, and they didn't know they would live to see this day.
As he said, they touched and left.
I was diagnosed with cancer of the kind that could be treated with surgery, and they did.
If they don't, they're going everywhere.
This would be a very bad situation.
This changes your outlook on life.
He met William in mid-2013.
He was very lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, but he would not know if there would be a correct statement in such situations, but he would be able to at least reduce the focus.
I had to get paid so I needed to get better.
It's a comfort to me.
I was in the hospital, and I walked up to six feet [6.9.15 m] in the garden, even though they said I had enough steps to take.
That's how it started.
It's a journey to its own head, but it's a little bigger.
After the visit, he was in Williams, who had been talking a little more than ever to get his mind over his own concerns.
Stanning, who was head of the United Kingdom Summit and who had previously been to Afghanistan, said, "I was in a state of emotional exhaustion this week, maybe it's a little too much, but I mean very much."
That's what it means to me and Helen and me and Robin how much they work.
I spent three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't have had it. That's why I want to thank him for being the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost five years of competition.
The two of them have been holding a strong rhythm that won't reach them.
The power of Stanning and Glover, the last 500 meters between the New Zealand and Denmark teams, has not yet been broken.
We got caught up in that mom.
Helen used to sound like, "Keep watch, watch the process."
It's really important not to get caught.
We did a good start, and we didn't try to do anything incredible.
We didn't expect to blow the air today, but we just wanted to win the race we came out with a good circle, and we did.
He'll call you a year before he decides what he'll do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to share in the month before us; his own and television amateur Steve Backshall's.
Now she just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have made a lot of pressure.
He took six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and I was very stressed out.
It's been here about four minutes.
That's a much better feeling."

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Made As Basic Caricature
Snapchat says that it's derived from anomalies for this filter, but some observers say it's insensitive.
Snapchat allows every day 150 million rounds of the user to play with his peers at an abstract level by changing the reality of the user's life.
If you're a mother, you can become a dog or a Roy Liechtenstein character.
Creoles are unique and unique tools that make up the environment that has grown over 30 million each day.
Mistakes are soon to enter the memory of the people.
Snapchat's beads have been compared to the accusations that the application in the past supported the black classification or the white-white-tonnes that have been accused of being ideally fine.
That's why, because of this week's pressure, the user's eyebrows, the lack of hair and fat, some designers have been led by this company to be a "Asian mask" that would caricarate the Assassins.
And they were wondering if this kind of argument did not indicate a greater issue with regard to diversity.
News and news spread with The Verge and Motherboard's news on Wednesday, and one day he heard that Snapchat had removed his property.
The company was found in an explanation: Mercek, it was prepared with respect for the anime characters, not for the creation of the Asians.
But for those who have had the experience of driving, it reminded them of the painful steroids.
He generally refused to compare my anime to others.
Grace Sparapani, an American art scholar from Korea who wrote a lot of tweets about photos, said that the poem in an e-mail is "the least of the most painful and disturbing words."
"The great core caricature added that it is difficult to argue when the effects of the filter are related.
This also shows that the filter is not only a basic mask but also an essential mask at the same time as the lowering level.
Snapchat, it's not the only company that's involved in cultural triggering mechanisms.
America's culture, the meeting of organizations from its rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all carry in our hands is seen in an endless exchange of diversity and captivating.
And what Snapchat calls for can be translated into the way they can be in a higher sense expectation of the larger young kittens, which are more than the other opposites.
When Katie Zhu, a 25-year-old reporter, created a small dropout for a user in Snapchat's 25-year-olds, said, "It's much harder not to recognize such actions as before."
On Friday, Ms. Zhu, a producer manager working for the Media, decided to delete the Snapchat account and called everyone in this regard.
In an article written for the media and a report on the telephone, he said that he believed that there were differences in the various aspects of employment in Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu concluded her article with a label: #SnapchatiSilin.
Ms. Zhu, an American from China, said: "They can either make such decisions because different races are not available in sufficient variety or because there are different types of people working there and they don't feel as confident or calm as they can talk to themselves."
And other observers share their views on this complaint that Snapchat left him in a large place.
The company does not share the number of persons involved in the diversity of individuals by promoting their private company status.
On Friday, Snapchat refused to share the root sources of Snapchat's staff, but according to one dictionary, it was the responsibility of the company to focus on populations not represented in sufficient order recently and to increase their involvement.
Ms. Zhu, on her own initiative, said that she would keep the Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if there are no more users like us who can say it's not true."
The Congress panel, the Military Qualifications, said that he recognized the DPRK.
A report published on Friday revealed that a congress panel, the United States of America, praised the United States authorities of the Central African Republic, Iraq and Syria for their willingness to draw a better picture of the events in the conflict against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
A report prepared by the Military Services Committee, the Committee of the Interior and the Sub-Committee for Defence found that the work of the Vice-Presidents of the Community Organization has changed the evaluations of the Islamic State of the United States of America by the Central Commission for Human Rights Analysts has been "no good" among the media analysts.
Centcom is a military commander known as the Central Command, Tampa, Fla. and the Central and Central Asian American Army.
In a news section on the report, the following statements were made: "The results of history approved by previous Centcom leaders are usually more positive in drawing up a picture of the facts in the field of the U.S. field than they have shown in their efforts to prevent the U.S. over and over again the analysis of the other elements of the population's history."
"What's in Centcom is unacceptable; our combatants are struggling to cope with the adverse analysis of the top-level decisions."
The leadership failure in Centcom has reached the highest levels of the institution.
The 10-page report also provided details of the remaining problems in 2014 and 2015, which were identified and analysed by the Central Commission of the United States of America in its efforts to educate the Iraqi authorities.
While there is no clear evidence that the Director of the Holy Obama has ordered the change of reports by the authorities, it is clear that the analysts have been impressed by the fact that there is no evidence that the President of the Islamic Republic has been responsible for the change of reports.
The report says: "In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, verbatim and congressional expressions are more positive than in the case of file cases."
For example, a Centcom authority has stated that a major military attack to get Muslims back publicly would be possible early on Nisan or May 2015.
The second largest Muslim city in Iraq is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansa's Community Representative, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement, "This is particularly clear after months of research."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States of America has handled the results of the mandate to launch the most important historical leaders of the Central United States to the risk of the launch of the ISID in Iraq.
The community has created a task force after it has learned that the analysts have brought their concerns about the Islamic Government to the mind of manipulating the story.
As the efforts continue, the report published on Friday will be followed by much more comprehensive findings.
There is another Centcom story survey carried out by the General Inspectorate of Defence.
The members of the Democratic Committee of the Republic of Sarajevo have also published their own findings that contributed to some of the consequences of the Community's work on Friday.
The Committee's Democratic President, Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement "has created a very short-term process in assessing the history of Centcom, the DAS and the Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "has delayed the dissemination of the results of the story", led to moral breakdown among analysts and "has not allowed enough room for disputes."
However, Mr. Schiff and Democrats have indicated that White Saray's analysis of Centcom's consequences has not reached a finding that the press has not been applied to "pre-defined or political information".
The preliminary results of the Congress' survey were announced by Daily Beach on Saturday.
In August last year, New York Times revealed that there was a general survey of the Pentagon virus, which was revealed after the complaints made by the New York Times and Centcom analysts.
Mr. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentecostal spokesman, said that the general investigation of the General Inspectorate in a statement would not take place during the period during which the Defence Authority would take no action on the Congress report.
However, she said, "in some cases the authorities may be inconsistencies with the translation of complex information and support the Health Dialogue on this important national security aspects of the Defence Authority with its history community."
The investigation will alert Iraq and Syria to the fact that the U.S. bombing operation is not continuing (this is more than every day by the defence authority).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how much President Obama can trust the Central Commission to assess military operations at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Despite the approval of many analysts, President George W. Bush, Centcom began writing an article that said he was not thinking enough after work in 2003 and that he had been discussed for ten years.
Mr. Hooker has also played an important role when it comes to Islamic State history.
Despite Mr. Hooker's public statements last year, the authorities indicated that the air raids against the Raffins that the Islamic Government had in its hands, despite the fact that the terrorist group had built to sell oil in the garage, did not have an impact on the record of the terrorist group's resources.
However, this finding did not appear outside the Central Command, as The Times pointed out in July.
Centcom's team at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, has been reluctant to act because the statement made in Senate by many legislators is considered to be a positive estimate of the war.
General Austin was born in Nisan and replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, who took his place in the Central Community.

Katie Bam, a 6-1-day strike against Japan, was shot three times a day, and on Friday, when the Americans attacked India from 3 to 0, women in the United States threw the first two arms of the women's hockey team.
Bam (27) said he didn't make sure he didn't do the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those who keep their hands.
If you know this, the Americans are sharing the first line in the Olympic tournament with the United States, which took Japan from 4 to 0 on Friday after the 2 to 0 on Friday.
The United States of Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams won the right to finish the race, and the game, the six teams, will determine who's the first and who's the second to finish the game.
The team that first finished the group's games will not face a little longer with the powerful Dutch team, which is leader of another group.
But after Saturday afternoon in May, the Americans, after the London Olympics last from 12 teams, made a remarkable progress here.
I was in this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa. He was 3 years old when he first took his best shot at the doll and was the youngest player of the team at the age of 16 in Drexel.
She lost her 2008 Olympics because she couldn't get into the last frame.
Later came in 2012 when he and his teammates didn't have much on their way.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was assigned to work, and the work began to change.
"A cultural change, a spiritual change, a physical change."
We're not working like London anymore.
We're completely out of my way.
On Friday night, Bam, he took the first count of the first day of the first day of the month of the war.
He had not yet taken a lead in India's tournament, but the team was able to defend himself as a 1-0 to the third floor of Bam's circle.
He made a long flight from the left of the stage and then he turned around and went to the top of the street and drove the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales put the last gun in the middle of the fourth floor.
This was the first game I ever played in the tournament with Jackie Briggs, a U.S. agent who lets one in the first three.
The chance's open.
That's what Bam did.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now," but it's about how good this place is on Saturday afternoon.
Tramboline Attention in the Midst of the Olympics
Wherever you are, no matter how long, the Olympics continue.
The activities of Rio de Janeiro represent a full range of recipes and work, and it's as if it's never going to end or run away.
It's like an olive tree with its own face and its triathlon to the gymnasium.
Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos can't watch TV without hearing anything about the crash between them, or you can't read the paper, or you can't listen to what your neighbor says in a coffee shop.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who first participated in the Olympics, may be one of the names shown in the springtime hours, among TV ads that tell you how you feel.
But Lake Forest is fighting for gold medals in Olympics from California.
The Olympics don't explain every activity at the same level.
Far from the center, there are some sports that are not widely known in the dark: airship shooting, shooting, shooting, badminton, tekwando.
The sacrifice will always be with us, if it's been a long time.
But if I have to tell you what I like most personally, I'd like to pay attention to the mystery of the trampoline.
No matter how much the trampoline has been known as an Olympic activity since 2000 that has been known in Sidney's games, a few people I've been asking for in the past 16 years have not realized that this is an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional disaster.
The United States had never won a medal in the trampoline if it sent its athletes to compete, and there was no contestant higher than the finals by 2012.
Among men were Chinese, Russian, Chinese, Canadian, and Chinese.
Rosie MacLennan will try to protect the gold treasures they bought in London this year from China from Dong Dong and Canada.
However, the conventional trampoline is careful as a complex activity; it may be that it is thought that the Olympics are due to the flagship school rather than the Olympics.
I have to admit I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the matter.
There's a funny potential (like a line of film created by an endless breakdown) but it's also fuels the description of the gymnasium and the race that brings together two sports.
The word "Trambolin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampoline, which means "tramplen."
The champions are almost 30 feet above the ground in a large trampoline and want to make a series of moves (burm, pike and salto) before they fall on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to performance, violence and "flight time".
In Rio, 16 men from 17 countries and 16 women are going to fight thirty-two athletes.
Make real progress in the most frequent progress in the Olympics.
Believers must go back to the point of exit in their gold contacts, to the point of exit in some cases, to the point of going back and forth with the lower movement, to the longer, faster and higher.
They're not just following the exit line or the starting wall, they've got another hard line on television at the same time; the world or the Olympic record.
It's a great effort to be honest, honest and even superior; it's enough to turn a viewer into their own eyes.
But that's exactly what I've been looking for when I'm watching the Games.
Tramboline, it's gonna give you a call for all of this.
Those in the trampoline move right up there.
Their goals are not moving forward.
He climbs up, he climbs up, he looks like an astronott, he climbs up, he climbs down, and he climbs up again without any effort.
Of course, it can't be said that there's no rehabilitating or hard work, but there's no humour to reach the end of the routine, there's no loss of distance, just like the thought of time and place, it's a shame to be taken into the army.
A Olympic race can be as tough as it is.
The women's sequences and their finals will be arranged at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday.
The NBC will publish its finals every two days as a block from 14 a.m.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise to be seen in the general garden without voice and for a wonderful moment.
And according to the scientist The Wall Street Journal, we can say that if the United States is going to be more than just looking at and inventing male athletes, as the U.S. gymnastics suggested just a short time ago, Mr. Dooley is waiting for new surprises.
It's been a long time in Ethiopia, U.S. Detective, "One Seed Protestoda" in Ethiopia.
Protesto People in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia, political change was faced with the government's violent lifestyle.
The Witnesses say that a large number of protesters have taken deadly weaponry in a meeting with the police.
About going down to Ethiopia?
In the past ten years, one of Africa's most stalemate countries has been a healthy haven for the West with its rapidly expanding economy.
However, in the months we have been facing government protests, spreading the country more and more every day.
Just last week, thousands of people went out of the street asking for basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government had a very poor attitude about this.
The Witnesses said they had shot and killed so many police officers.
From the end of the year or from the beginning of this year's time of protest, there's a security officer who's got to stand up against a wall.
The United Nations at the highest level wants a detailed survey of human rights.
Rashid Abdi, director of the Somali Support Project of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said "It will always be difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward."
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the focus of Africa's highest country and is to be designated by the West.
America's military and historical services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats to Somalia in the first place, and there are very few countries in West Africa that see this kind of help.
Ethiopia's economy is growing in an interactive way.
The submarine has been improved in an active way; President Addis Ababa has a new railway station.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
As far as Ethiopia was concerned, the country's best example of democracy was very limited in its internal dialogue, and it was in an active role in the creation of human rights groups.
Most of them were sent to prison, jailed, killed, or dragged to the farthest corners of the desert.
But this can be about changing.
Seyoum Teshome, a professor at a university in Central Ethiopia, said, "If you don't give people a choice, this will happen."
Youth is a complete protest.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints as much as the pressure on the coalition's power from its use.
After a very active election last year, she also took the last seat of the ruling party and the MPs, and she can now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, hundreds of people who have lost their lives in the months of Ezra also increase their number of refugees, including Eritrean, who have lost their lives in war.
Analysts, Oromo Freedoms Cefes or Ogaden National Freedoms Cefes are afraid of re-arming the various groups we've been using in the middle of the years that we've spent like Ogaden National Freedoms Cefes.
Over the years, there are several factors that explain why the pain in the face of global warming is now on the horizon.
The first seems to be smart phones.
As the mobile phones spread and the Internet service became available, communication was started only a few years ago, using Ethiopian social media in large numbers.
The government was able to communicate with Internet agents who, like they often did in protest times, closed their access to Facebook and Twitter.
Several Ethiopian youths said they were gathered in this way for protesters.
Second, there was also an increase in the conflict between Oromolars and Amharas, two large ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not normally feared.
For a long time, many of Ethiopia's high-ranking areas of Christianity were benefiting from the Oromos, who were Muslims in politics and business.
But that's also changing.
An Oromo leader, Mulatu Gemechu, said "We are going to meet under one shadow and work together."
The biggest protesters were seen in Amhara and Oromo.
Most people think that Amhara and Oromo, Ethiopia, have been dominated by members of the ethnic group that have created a population of about 6 percent and that the military, history services, commerce and politics are not fair by members of the Tagrayan ethnic group.
The third reason why Meles Zenawi fell asleep after the accident was dead.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles has served as head of Ethiopia for 17 years from an unexplained disease in 2012.
He was thinking he was a tactical hero when he saw everyone not seeing him.
Analysts say he's a scientist in the field of not detecting the first signs of his lack of silence and not comforting and inactivating opponents.
The interview analyst Mr. Abdi said "The current regime does not have this basic knowledge."
The new head of Ethiopia was selected by Hailemariam Desalegn, the new head of Mr. Meles.
Mr. Meles, who comes from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, is a South American.
Analysts say they didn't gain confidence in the security services they controlled by the Tigers themselves.
As a result, more and more of her fear was shed more blood.
The last experience of Ethiopia in this kind of conflict was that of the following atrocities committed by thousands of people after an election by the government of analysts in 2005.
In the following steps, as far as we've been concerned, many protesters have been killed, and this conflict has passed more quickly.
Sculpture scientists, Ethiopia's leaders, have sought to plan a new video album like a new bany train and to make valuable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is evident that this did not stop the increase in the number of people who heard about the Ethiopian government.
And this is dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city of Amhara, attacked businesses owned by the Tigers, and the hatred of Tigrian also increased in the social media.
Analysts say protestors left other terrorists in the United States and the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for non-human aircraft flights on neighbor Somalia, but it said it was closed a short time ago.
If the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want this ambiguity in a region that is currently broken up.
Mr. Abdi said "This" and added "as if to walk on a lot of ice."
Donald Trump described Obama's idea of creating the ISIS as "Agreement"
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, several times last week, tried to eliminate the last argument around the campaign, claiming that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were a terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This explanation raised new questions regarding the conclusion of the establishment of a clear communication with the people of the United States of America as the President of the Republic.
At the same time, during the time that this burden was created to protect it, the officers who tried to explain it were doing their best to protect it.
Mr. Trump, after a meeting on Wednesday night on this proposal, he was very concerned about the fact that Mrs. Clinton had actually made an ISIS.
But on Friday morning, when he sent him on Twitter early in the morning, Mr. Trump said he was just in a funny statement.
It showed that Mr. Trump had taken a step back a day before he said he was serious about this crime in a series of reports.
The interviewer's radio programmer Hugh Hewitt said when Mr. Obama tried to help him calm down this pressure, he said he didn't believe the President of the Community in this case.
Mr. Trump, when he was trying to change his campaign room after the explosion, the last car came out.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made a deal this week about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to come back to this matter again.
She once again spoke on Twitter that Ms. Clinton's offers would increase taxes and that she found her speech more frequent.
Mr. Trump used to defend himself before.
Towards the end of the month of December, after seeing a vision of the Russians coming up on Mrs. Clinton's cross-attacked e-mails, he said, "Of course I've said it in an interesting way."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to restrict his political speech boundaries and to step back where he needs to.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who was both used to monitor the language, said: "It is a way to make "explanation" in a way that allows those who support themselves to do so."
But at the same time, he gives his brains knowledge and knows he's so ignorant that it's gonna be filtered when it's looked at from different angles.
In the last few days, after we went into the polls, Mr. Trump would have been a much more offensive to calm the air rather than to calm the general vote.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday revealed that Ms. Clinton was in the vicinity of North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and that there was a lot of competition in Florida.
As far as Mr. Trump is concerned, if he avoids an apology for the terrible things he has said, he is guilty of misleading or misunderstanding what he has said.
But in the last months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes, which are much more intrusive than they are, leave the loyal supporters who are in a difficult position to support him, no matter how unpleasant their circumstances may be.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolf W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most important supporters, did his best to protect the island on Friday with CNN.
When Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton were asked about the rightness of their body towards the establishment of the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said "Bensen is doing a political act."
It was a small structure that was unknown to Obama before, and it was completely wrong to find them, and it was because the soldiers were expelled from Iraq.
The majority of the leading Community is trying to defend the failure of Mrs. Clinton's Obama's foreign supervisor to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and why the ISID is growing up.
On Friday, before the meetings to be held in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the media of hitting every word and acting against it.
He said, "They can't do this!"
Some Democrats argued that this was evidence that Mr. Trump was not fit for the president.
With us again in Coffee Greenpoint, which can't lead to Files
Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, an old-fashioned place that only works with nakit in Williamsburg, was a great coffee for 15 years.
Of course, he couldn't afford the price at Bedford Avenue's store.
In 2014, Soap Cherie sells soap in a store that replaces Verb.
The people of the region were near by saying that this was the last city to be visited.
The artist Molly Crabaple wrote to Twitter. "It's my change in New York, but I don't believe that CBGB's gone, Chelsea Hotel's been released, and Verb's now a soap store."
But New York is a city to be rebuilt until it's changed.
In the past month, in the Greenpoint, less than a mile away from our original location, a Verb Caffe was opened in the north.
He has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards but protects some of his former employees and the same simple air.
The coffee's fine.
At the beginning of the new Verb, there is Cisco Rodriguez, the owner and general manager of the new place where the old boss worked for a long time.
In 2001, he joined Verb and stayed until the end.
A client said he'd be excited to do this when you offered to finance this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), he left much the same thing.
Verb is using the same distribution for the monkeys and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the lights of the old Verb were re-used here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to take some change of experience.
He added new equipment.
It also serves such equipment as cassavas and soybeans in the context of the translucent-ymmetrical-ve-intervehicle sandwiches.
There's Esmer-Pirican boxes.
Coffee no longer serves beer, but it represents fresh fruit water.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he realized that the old defenses were starting to come in a decisive way.
He said, "Many of our old customers couldn't do it with prices in Williamsburg."
On Friday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and often goes to Verb.
After he was transferred to Greenpoint, he didn't give up on this road.
After the verb had been closed, he said he had been calling for coffee for a while.
He said, "I realized that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now she started to drink coffee again, but she chose a new set of teas instead of ice cream last day.
Another lawyer, Tom Rosenthal, has been on his way to Verb since 2003.
He'll go there before he does, and he'll always give him the same order.
He said, “Every day I had seven fat cows; I had no fear of them; and they were ready for me every day to prepare me a roasted calf.”
The photo said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to change and added new items to the menu.
Today, Mr. Rosenthal is still making some changes in his daily diet by adding butter and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said it wasn't too expensive for the soap store that took place in the old place.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb using coffee that was cold.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents would have had this coffee.
One of the new customers translated the menu to Lehce and Mr. Rodriguez said that the new neighbors would soon find a place to organize this menu so they could feel good about themselves.
There are other advantages in the new neighborhood.
The local fruit store wants to drink and sell frozen coffee.
There's a possibility that the ceiling will be expanded by spreading the building.
It's enough that a new Verb exists that they can find their old favorites for most customers.
Joseph White was a regular client, and he was very sorry after the site was closed.
When the new place was opened, Mr. White said that he felt like he was at home to get in and get some coffee.
He said, "I should've stopped this."
In the book "A Square Meal" to Eat Depressive Food in Crisis Time
In March 1933, shortly after sitting in the presidential seat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch at Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, one of his cousins, liked to eat a delicious Fifth Avenue like a chicken.
That day's menu was much more complicated: dominate fruit juices, potatoes and sweet pastries.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was a way of dealing with people who were suffering from stress."
Andrew Coe added: "It was a message to the Americans about how they should eat at the same time."
A couple of food historians living in Brooklyn Heights.
Mr. Coe's final book was "Chop Suey" in China, and Mrs. Ziegelman was talking about eating life in the evenings in the South East.
The new book they're working together and the "A Square Meal" that will be published by Harper on Saturday tells us the history of American food during the Great Wall.
They also met a reporter at Eisenberg Sandvic Büfes, located in the Flatiron region since 1929, since the year the food crisis began.
Ms. Ziegelman (54), who was preparing cream and oil sandwiches, preferred Mr. Coe (57), India, potatoes powder and cheese.
Two, he found out that the guest's routine coffee was suitable for the discussion of the food of the crisis period.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "Somuns were very popular."
He had his foot on the ground, his foot on the ground, his foot on the ground, his foot on the ground.
These were made of a tiny thing that spreads the matter with an object.
Just think of how much you've eaten until you've had enough time to eat at dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got his face on.
He said, "It must have been sitting on a man's head like yours."
In the years leading up to the crisis, particularly in the short areas, it was like the streets in America were open.
Women were preparing meals for men working on farms and served freshly cooked potatoes for breakfast, breakfast, and dinner.
1. In World War I, the Americans were sending food to the hungry Europeans. "A Square Meal", explains the history of the way they managed to get out of being the center of the country at one time.
Mr. Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it, said, "It was a time when food became a special concern for Americans."
The new regime was equally concerned: secret food, such as somuns and crates, became the basic pattern of corruption, according to Ms. Ziegelman, "was a great way to assess the leftovers' food" so that traders could hide undergarments with a creamy soybean.
He took instead of fresh fruits, which are smaller in size.
Over the years, it's been in the center of America's food, and it's become a luxury that's been distributed in a tighter fashion.
He tried interesting relationships for the calorie and the fifth value, and he passed before the general sense of taste or general sense of smell.
Mrs. Ziegelman, while doing research on the tariffs for the book, prepared a full-fledged piece of paper.
Mr. Coe said, "It wasn't a favorite piece of dinner on the street tonight."
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this, "That was true."
There's no point in sharing with someone who's stuck in the faucet.
It's an important feature in most households' economy.
Among them, the Federal Home Economics Office's responsibility for home economics, found by Louise Stanley, was directed as never before between 1923 and 1943.
They encouraged women to be "fucking" in newspapers and magazines and magazines and articles and promoted the fight against changing their tastes for food, such as air creamy spaghetti.
A short visit to the "A Square Meal" history.
President Herbert Hoover's promises to his government's open fellow citizens like pasta are finally open.
When Iwa, who was a child of her own, stopped eating vegetables, millions of people who turned into intellectuals were eating them.
Mr. Coe said, "He likes to eat their fun in Europe like a healthy green fish."
He ate cakes suitable for their dinners, almost entirely in a golden dining room.
He's been far away from the truth.
If Eleanor's wife didn't complain about being an example to her cousin, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
According to the book, Ms. Roosevelt's pleasure of taking a non-profit assistant to work in White Saray was just "not the best food ever, but the most elaborately prepared tobacco" began to be served at the same time.
After the country re-emerged on its feet, many of the ways of food production during the crisis were left to one side.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, calorie and nutrition are continuing to be used to prepare food for my science.
When she wrote the book, she said that she had learned a lot from Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she never smoked.
Mr. Coe said, "It was really scary for him to eat."
Mrs. Ziegelman said of their old memories: "He has actually sickened people."
There was a creamy bread bag.
After the tobacco collection in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe produced a sweetness that they had prepared at home: they ate raw meat at President Roosevelt's dinner.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "It's called a broken hole," and added the most frequently applied number, to name these beautiful fields.
There was no cracking cream; we only dry up a little bit, sugar, water and rice.
Everyone squeezed his throat when he found the coffee stick.
It wasn't very bad in a strange way.
Mr. Coe, he's got the second and the third.
He said to his wife as if he were a potential rival.
Hepatitis C will receive Gilead lawyers' fees in the fight with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge, Gilead Sciences Inc, the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc won the right to receive legal fees for the hepatitis C patent case.
After the U.S. Judge Merck's false testimony and other foreign applications found themselves in a series of wrong behaviours, Gilead was reduced to pay 200 million dollars for two Merck patents for Sovaldi and Harvoni in the month of July.
On Friday's trial, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that he had the right to be reimbursed for payments made during Gilead's trial.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, the head of the market with new genetic hepatitis C drugs that can improve more than 90 percent of breast cancer patients.
Dava, Gilead and Merck are responsible for the ownership of the laboratory's work on sofosbuvir, which is the active substance of Gilead's drugs.
The US-supported forces said that the control of Membic was completely taken from the Islamic State
On Friday, the group speaker, the United States-supported forces, said that the last Islamic state fighters in the city had completely taken control of the northern city of Membic.
After a group of soldiers left behind in the city of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) were separated, the city was cleaned.
She told Sharfan Derviš, Routers, from the Army Council of the Membitic Army, during the strike with SDG, that they had left the civilian legacy free over 2000 of their own soldiers.
He said to Routers, "We're only doing cleaning work under our control now."
Clinton's family won $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax by 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton explained that on Friday, Democrats won the presidential island and our wife won $10.75 million last year and showed that there were 34.2 percent of the government tax paid there.
In 2015, the Clinton family provided $1 million for most of its institutions to be Clinton's Vakfé, and old President Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million from his speech fees and announced that he had received $3 million from Simon & Schuster for the period he spent in the Foreign Office.
Clinton's great friend, Senator of the United States, from Virginia, Tim Caine, published his 10-year-old tax account with Anne Holton.
In 2015, the U.S. government tax rate was 20.3.
In a statement by Jennifer Palmieri, the leader of Clinton's campaign, said "The years continue to set standards for the protection of Clinton and Tim Kaine's property."
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false charges and taking back his tax statements.
It's a practice for U.S. presidents to give their tax statements openly.
Trump and lawyers, a business man in New York, said that the refusal of public statements was an investigation by the Board of Directors.
Ian Sams of Clinton's campaign campaign was linked to the presidents of the Democratic Party.
On Friday, Trump, Special Agent Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish these until the trial was completed.
In 2012, the Group of the People's Republicans, Mitt Romney and other Community citizens included Trump, said that they had created many other issues regarding their independence, their involvement in their non-profit institutions, their business agreements and their involvement with Russia.
Clinton published a translation video showing that he was using pressure on top of the high-level community on Friday to explain his taxes to Trump.
On Friday, he brought this matter up in an economic conversation in Michigan.
He said to the rest, "He refuses to do what every president has done for years and to publish his taxes."
Politico reported that Trump had not paid taxes for nearly two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times office wrote a series of tax attorneys and told him that the situation could still continue in this way.
The federal tax situations have become an important issue in my choice of leadership.
Clinton offered a legal offer named Warren Buffet, a billion-dollar investor, to pay at least 30 percent of those who won over $1 million a year.
President Obama supports this offer.
Last week, at a Clinton meeting in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hataway group was reading out loud about Buffett's arrival at Trump, where he was active.
Buffet said he was going through the IRS trial, and not from the Trump tax system, but from the voters.
Clinton published his tax statements until 2007.
The Clinton family now living in Chappaqua, New York, has paid the average federal tax between 2007 and 2014 by 32 percent, and the combined tax is about 40.5%.
Clinton's family's pay for 2015, but most Americans are only showing that their income is only $100.
The largest investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and Clinton's family has declared their income to be $109,000.

Dust red condoms support the protection of shells in Tanzania
The inhabitants of Tanzania use a method that is not used to prevent people from entering the areas of human settlements; they throw them with dust red condoms.
It proved that my approach was effective, and with the U.S. Central Nature Protection Unit, found in Honeyguide a few years ago, it began to teach about the use of non-violent protection in northern Tanzanian villages, without harming their homes and their two animals.
Most people used to use knives to protect themselves.
On Friday, World Phil Day for the Protection of Animals.
Director-General Damian Bell in Honeyguide said in a statement, "We've seen changes in these communities since we've developed a new set of cells; now they're more inclined to keep away from each other without harming the rats."
The first two steps include holding and stealing the previous file.
In situations where it is impossible to do so, what is called "red-haired cloud" is fired.
It's a piece of dust mixed with dust red. It's placed in a condom with a chestnut bag. It's just stuck up so it's clear.
When it's hot, condom opens up with a blast and it pours red dust into the air.
It's enough to send a windshield down the road.
The last thing you can do is to use a lack of air bubbles, high voice, light explosions.
The Jewish filmmaker shot Israel's phone code on the "thab" of the Arabs from a hotel in Berlin - RT News
A Jewish French filmmaker opened a press release after he found out that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code and that the workers were using the Arab customers' "tapes".
Claude Lanzmann, a writer of the Shoah document on the case, wrote to FAZ by the German public body in his open letter to the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of hotel's telephone codes that had been saved in a short time.
But the country did not take place among the states that could actually call from the room.
In 2016, how could Israel be left clean and destroyed in Berlin, the new president of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol, Israel, refers to the call on its own call center.
The filmmaker told the hotel's reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote "he's shocked."
The hotel secretary stated that this procedure was taken by "a very important decision by Kempinski-Hotels" administration.
The reason why the filmmaker was asleep under this move was much more upset.
According to Lanzmann, the worker said, "Most of our fellows wanted to delete the code of Arab and Israel."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German ambassador of Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this state "a great shame".
This situation got us down and really surprised.
That's really a big shame.
It's a much bigger order that it's been in Germany and in a hotel prison like this.
You don't have to explain it.
We're waiting for the hotel to end up from this."
The case was a major trend in the translator's environment; people were designed as scandalous.
Some accused Campinski Hotel of "blowing" in the words of Arab customers.
In another post, a hotel was located near a synagogue, in Kurfurstendam's camp, where the expression "to sleep" was replaced by the expression "to sleep."
According to Dr. Spiegel's report, the hotel quickly initiated these charges by saying that this was the result of "indiscriminateness" and "asking for forgiveness" from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung stated that one of Kempinski's representatives said "there was no real order to include Israel's emergency call list."
And he said they're already added.
The police used gas and plastic paint against Brazilian Protestant students.
On Friday, students gathered in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, for a demonstration against reforms on the government's public education system.
The police used gas and plastic paint against the protestors.
The problem began in the era in which security officials tried to spread their students, and this led to the use of plastic paint and beer gas by the police.
Hundreds of students were involved in protesting their discontent with plans.
Mr. São Paulo's offer by Mr. Geraldo Alckmin is that less than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the people who participated in the protest were seen writing on walls by President Michel Temer.
This last protest occurred a few days after protestors marched out to the streets to support President Language Rousseff, who was removed from the country's Senate.

In 10 years of age, 30 000 lira receptors
President Recep Tayyyyip Erdoğan's call for "fate down" was in motion by banks.
First, Emlak Konut was suggested that banks include the campaign father GYODER, who started and then joined GYODER.
The psychologically-recognitioned share credit rates were also taken by President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan.
The 13 bank account credit rate has dropped to less than 1 percent.
It's been the public banks that started the shipment.

TERCY 5 AND 10 YEARS
And how much benefit will it bring to those who will take home?
A man who uses 100 thousand lira for 10 years of credit will provide 30,000 lire from the decline.
The vast majority of those who use account credit choose a 5-10-year payroll plan.
It's expected that in the days ahead, there will be more of them than ever before.
The sale of money will also have a positive effect.
In 2015, sales of cotton increased by 10.6 per cent in the previous year, by 1 million, 289 000.

It's an important step to get people's banks down the line.
They listened to our superior's call and sent down the beans.
But this is going down to the bottom of 9 percent in the year.
If this delivery is going on, we're going to have to extend the .70 percent of the month we started.
Black Group YKYKKU Self-Cut: Our campaign may take 3 months

Faiz has fallen, home has been destroyed
The manager of a public bank sent a message to my friend.
It's always the same thing.
It's getting worse. It's getting more and more expensive.
The price is rising, the prices of the house are falling.
He says, "Look at this again."
She tells me how she feels about her work with environmental credit.
Emlak Kout says that many researchers who have been involved in a 0.10-percent campaign that has been edited by Emlak Konut say they have increased their prices in many of the accounts project.
I've seen if there's any truth.
He's got a condition. He doesn't have any sex.
In the meantime, we came up with an amazing conversation with the construction team that our paper was edited a week after the 15th of December.
The boss of a big firm...
When I didn't give my name, I said, "You're going to have to do 10 percent of prices."
Following the entry into employment, Emlak Konut launched a large sales campaign with 0.70 percent and 120 months of sales.
I accept it. He put his hand under your shoulder before the banks. He's at risk.
But ma'am, we're moving together and together in order not to cut Turkey's pace.
The banks have supported your campaign for 1 month.
Then let no one take advantage of it.
And beware of what you do.
President Erdoğan, Ömer Koč and Ali Koč have accepted

Call from BDK: Call those banks
President Mehmet Ali Akben, President of the Banking and Management Board (BDDK), made an explanation regarding the "credit call" notification to banks of President Erdoğan.
"We will certainly not allow banks to call back on credit if they turn the market's terms into an opportunity and do it with different companies."
We say to those who bring this kind of complaint and information to us, 'By name in the bank and company, you're going to have to discuss the BDK complaint line.'
President Tayyyyip Erdoğan warned banks of these words: "I believe that when debt falls and credit opportunities are increased, our country and investors and banks will be opened up again."
So let's just say we're going to avoid credit giving in our country this time, and then we're going to figure out that banks who call back the creditors have given them a fair answer, and I want to tell you that.
In the year 7-8, banks won money from these things.
500 loving Russian tourists are waiting
Mr. Ali Kzülden, President of the Professional Hotel Managers of the Poyd (POYD), stated that Turkey-Russia's relations were on a positive route before the 15th of December in an event organised in the history of Antalya, and that there was a certain stay in the tourism area.
President Recep Tayyyyip Erdoğan, who said that Russia's President Vladimir Putin's meeting with President Erodogan excited the tourism sector, as it was between the two countries, "I hope that tourism will be a very positive development for all sectors, both inside and outside the country."
Turkey and Russia have a very close relationship with each other, based on years.
He said, "As the two leaders of the two countries opened up this way, we, as sectors, can make progress very quickly, and I think we can close the streets and move towards goals."
Had it not been for employment, the Russian tourist who came to Turkey would have expected more than 1 million people to go to Turkey, the Red Cross, who said:
But when we said high season, we lost a month, so it's about reducing the target.
I'm still thinking we'll get over 500 grand if we start charter flights.
And it might be about the end of the season that the team will even go through the middle of the summer.
In such a situation, additional flights can be made to the front of the flight.
I expect this positive air will be highly valued by the Russian people.
They also have a sense of direction in Turkey.
I'm thinking maybe we're going to make 700 grand.
The Russian market, which expressed its hope for 2017, said that if Russia's economy were to be reassessed, Russia's number could rise to over 3 million next year.
As Poyd President Red pointed out that there is a small beginning of domestic reserves with the removal of the permission of the population, "There are re-entered reserves in which new reserves are being re-entered and new reservations are being received."
He said, "We have a hope for my sacrifice."
He said, "It would be good if we could bring 100-200 000 people from Iran from 1.2-2 months to 200 months."
Could not close temporary folder: %s
First of all, learn how the new interest rates you've made with the bank that you've received.
Calculate from your bank the amount of a new loan, at a lower interest rate than the amount of an early closing payment (up to 1.5-2 per cent of the amount used in general).
If you are still advantageous when you include all your assets, you can be used for low-cost credit use.

I've opened a door to women with disabilities," she said.

Captain FETÖ was handed over to Gülen's property
Adana Community Commissioner for Terrorism-Technical and Organise Crimes, who are not involved in the movement of FETÖ/PDY-related persons and organizations through the Office of Investigation, has been accused of raising the value of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist body by an unprofessional increase in the value of the change in its bid plans, with a view to providing funding to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization, with 17 suspects.
In the case of Fetullah Gülen, a number 1, who was convicted by the 'Don't Teach the National Court of Intervention' case, the court case decided to take the decision to arrest Mr. Ommer, Mr. Emal Elibal and Mr. Cemal.
However, it was decided that the court procedures would be carried out for 4 counts that had not yet been arrested and that had not been brought to trial.
Adana 2. The Criminal Court decided to hand over to the entire property of Fetullah Gülen, Emer II, Kemal Elibal and Cemal, which was found in a foreign country with a view to ensuring the integrity of the case in their rights and therefore failed to reach it.
The court's decision, together with the decision of the court, has resulted in the freezing of goods, goods and air transport vehicles in Turkey, all kinds of rights and rights, valuable assets, shares of the company, rental cash flows and bank accounts.
Hüzeyen Gülerce: The fall of Gülen depends on 3 feet down
Hüsein Gülerce, who was involved in the FETÖ's work, was found in the dramatic statements of Hülerce.
The heads of the line from Hüseyen Gülerce's statement are:
As I thought they were going to work, I wrote this in my last 5-6 months, "they can train but they can't do it in command jail."
I didn't know two things; the first is that this pressure is widespread and deep, such as the eight-year command subpoena of the General's General Command and the office of your Commander.
The greatest man who ever fought your Highness is how the hero looked when he chose his careers, but it's a secret that doesn't matter.
They're two faces.
"It's not a job that can make an embodiment like this," one of the most important evidence is that it's such a deep compass.
She's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA, this guy's got a very early hand.
Mahmut Uvür says that in 1971 they met with Fetullah Gülen at the Vehbi Koč's home in Fuat East.
That period tells people who are most involved in these activities as being the closest time between the CIA and the MIT.
Our armed forces paid the U.S. personnel's wages, and after they didn't remember, another man came out.
When do we learn this in 2014?
After Mahmut Bey wrote this, there was no explanation of it that lied.
For example, justice is out there, isn't it?
Who's interested in that?
Adam went to Pennsylvania twice the last 25 days before he was born and returned two days ago.
Since 2002, justice has gone out of the house 109 times.
When you bring all of this together, it needs to be investigated; all those who have fled to the U.S. since March 1999 have gone to the U.S. with a bank.
It'll be seen that they went to Pennsylvania with a vaccine.
But with the CIA, the actual results can be identified from here; in particular, many people have been sent to the United States in security from those who need to be lifted from security.
Wikileaks has documents; Gülen is building a bridge and this bridge is holding joint meetings with the CIA.
Since then, efforts have been made to show these connections to the CIA for 15 years.
I said Fuat Avni was a story hero in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works in the presidential office works for Fuat Avni.
But that's bad; this information is going down to the CIA, just like it's coming down to Pennsylvania.
The collapse of Gülen is related to the fall of three feet; one of us says that it was a friendly people, and some of them are in good hypnosis, even saying that Erdoğan's entry into the camp is still a film.
I was saying three feet, support.
The theft of the issues, theft, slavery, this base has been a major source of support.
The other two feet; political support, international support.
The international support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support is whether the MHP managers' tapes were pulled by FETE.
After the 15th of the month, "FETÖ" is also used by your Highness, and has opened the eyes of everyone.
"I don't do it." "I don't do it around."
I'm saying, "It's the weather, Mr. Hüseyen, these girls' demands are very different, they're sending me, I'm now law-enforced, because it's not right to act with dreams."
There was a voice record, the man who spoke in that voice record, Barbara Kocakurt: My friends were dreaming, Our Prophet sharing his tweets with two.
There's a police town in Nusaybin.
According to the information received, Séhaladdin was shot with long-distance weapons by a brutal vehicle that the police were carrying on their mission at the Job Hall.
The first fire opened up was a police town, a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were brought to nothing when they attacked the police's opposition.
The wounded police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
He's operating in the area.
Warned employees that no TV stations were broken
On 15 October, special televisions, which played an important role in preventing entry into employment, continued to be published through a technical staff who became pregnant in Turkey.
That's the hero Akkaya...
Akkaya, who said during the reading of the news at TRT, was involved in the psychology of the media, "I saw everything in the light of my friends' fires opened from helicopters."
They put a gun on my head and wanted me to cut off the press.
I just shut down the local TV.
Then I made them leave the building by saying we had to go to the sandy antennas.
I spent up to 20 minutes in the antennas in the area.
He said, "I cut some more cables here, but I didn't touch the public."
Before the workers were able to cut the flow in Turkey, the Samanyolu TV came with experts.
These terrorists were arrested by police three minutes ago.
When the workers returned to the building about 1 hour later, they realized that they had continued their TV broadcasts on the phone and that they had come to the grave at the time of their death, he told Akaka that they had lived:
I spent the night at 8:00 p.m.
It gave us that place.
One of my friends was a negotiator for the e-government and electricity system.
At 2100 hours we met to drink water, low-flight helicopters flew over us.
There were several other aircraft flying from low to low around the helicopter.
We saw their lights.
They were probably non-human aircraft that could be seen.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I was 11 years old, and I called for the first time because I saw this close flight.
And then a move started.
We found out when we were looking at the news, your brain was closed.
At that time, our general manager gave instructions to come to the building of friends who were not at that time in security.
We found out that all the publications in the TRT were missing when we were going to get information.
In five minutes, TRT's publications were cut off.
I called the TRT mom's team, but I couldn't get it.
Our control station said that the TRT publications came back and started to read the information.
Our Assistant Director-General asked the Director-General, under the direction of the Director-General, to immediately remove TRT publications.
We've started working to get the public out of the TRT 3 channel.
We've just heard that the President of the Biennial Star says there's a "refuge."
Our manager's order to cut 'TRT' led us to a bit of psychology.
We cut the trt, we heard the helicopter sound after a while.
We went out, the helicopters in the order burned out everywhere, everyone else broke up.
We hid a building behind the back.
We were 12 people together.
We got soldiers from the helicopters in the back.
A few of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We went out among them so that they would not be left alone.
I saw our assistant general at that time and they're down and down.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
One said, "I'll shoot one of them, you scared."
Then they all sat in.
The commanders started shouting, "Who's responsible for this? I won't ask again."
And when we heard them say, "Let's shoot one another," we thought, "We don't have any information from the country, but we've got a training to stop the TRT."
So there's a resurrection.
I felt that I had given up my own life.
I said, "It's me."
I got up to my feet before I knew what I was going to do.
What I was thinking at the time was that my friends in the helicopter were fired.
I thought your 10-15 friend was a town in Nisami and thought we were gonna be killed in the end.
The command at the beginning said, 'You're gonna cut off all the publications except TRT.'
We have the system part that we monitor when we're tracking the local channels.
We're going out of the room with 80 of the local channels.
I think it's in this room.
There was no national spread between them.
If I cut them off and say that they're all cut off, at least until then they'll get help out.
Or I said he'd go as far as he went.
We agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "I'm gonna finish it."
I've cut out an anemone from the local channel packages.
I cut off the power button on the monitors we can watch the national channels.
So there's no signal on all screens.
I told him I had to go to the antennas so he could cut it off completely.
The commander sent me to the front with two soldiers.
I opened the front room, and a soldier said, "Stand there."
He was trying to get me a gun.
He said, "You're gonna break it all, you're not gonna stay, I'm gonna shoot one of you in the end, it's you."
And I said, "You'll see when you go," and I didn't say anything else.
We went into the station, and when I woke up, I broke down the locals.
We've gone over the other bridge.
At the time, I had developed a system that was close to 20 national channels.
Nearly 20 monitors have finally been emptied.
My Lord has helped us so that we did not transgress when we were given an answer, but He has guided us to the right path.
They believed in the answers we gave them.
They didn't.
This has comforted us.
After they got out of the bridge, they asked where the train was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV publisher," he said, "Is there an electric between you two?"
I said, "There's no electricity after tonight's case, but if it's wrong, the team will come."
In fact, there was an electric current at that time.
I thought I didn't break the cyberspace.
I thought I'd cut them off to warn the soldiers.
They were a little relieved because they thought the press was cut off.
They couldn't think of looking at the public.
Now the group's been waiting.
About an hour later, they opened the TV in the waiting room and they saw A News broadcast.
The soldier's inside.
He said, "My commander A has not stopped the news."
We're looking at the commander.
He said, "Get up on your feet."
I'm stuck.
Then a soldier said, "There are still spreads."
He said, "There are channels spreading in the sky."
I said, "They are spreading over the grave, and we can't do anything to them."
He said, “Then take us all to your feet after you have spoken to one of us.”
The workers escaped from Turkey with a minibus.
I've seen pictures of the soldier taking me to the bathroom and giving me water.
They shot three times before and after.
My friends promised me they were the same soldier.
We were calling that soldier 'evelat'.
He's probably a hero who's doing his army.
They may have sacrificed to save him.
According to Akkaya's statement, the first police team came to Turkey.
When he learned that the police teams were helicopters around him, he went back to pick up the importance.
They're back in 40 minutes.
When the police got here, they didn't see anyone in the Turkish outside order.
Just three or four minutes from the police, the Samanyolu TV said to Akkaya, who told him that the scientists were coming to the building, "They said to the police teams, 'They called us inside, we're Turkish personnel, we need to get in immediately."
He said, "They've been on their four cell phones for identity issues and they've been told that we're out of here."

Captain Vevat was released under the law of the Court of Justice and of the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice and of the State of Foreign Affairs.
And when I saw him speaking out of justice, I called out to him and said to him, "I am with your government."
May God forgive the workers.
What I know, 18 years I don't really know justice.
I didn't say justice was wrong.
I want her to be arrested in a minute.
It can't live in Turkey in this way, it can't live in the world.
Come on, trust in Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he'll get his punishment.
He's making it difficult for us to escape.
It's the police. It's the government.
It's 20-25 days. The police don't deal with anything else.
I'm gonna tell you that Turkey doesn't want to return to Syria, "We don't need to work."

The security officer also told Jose Carumba that when he explained to the local press that the guard was shooting at the judges after hearing the gun, a hand bomb was fired around it.
Curumba, the authorities, recorded how their prisoners were questioned about the murder of their own weapons of war.
Explosions in Thailand
Three people lost their lives in the explosions in four yards south of Thailand.
The authorities said that 3 people died in explosions in Trange, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, and 35 people were injured by tourists.
Piyapan Phingmuang, the police spokesman, explained that the bombings were not related to terrorism at his press conference.
Phingmuang, "Thailand doesn't have any regional or religious issues."
He used the expression "We think it's an inner sabotage action."
Cunta's leader, Prayut Chan, told reporters that he didn't want to do anything about who was behind the explosions.
Oza said, "We must focus on ensuring peace, peace and security."
In August 17 last year, the president of Bangkok's commercial center was killed by 20 people in a bomb attack near the Erewan Valley in Rajpraong, where 120 people were injured.
"Stolen Violence" will be attacked by the magic spell.
Lonnie David Franklin, 63, 63 years old, was sentenced to death by the Grim Sleeper who had been arrested for at least 10 years in the United States.
Franklin, an old cleaning worker, chose his wife and drug addicts in their murders.
Kathleen Kennedy, who was convicted of Franklin, said to the jury, "I haven't seen so many crimes like yours and so many crimes in my life."
Franklin is one of the most powerful killers in California's history.
It was learned that killing 10 people in prison and finding one person in the murder camp would be infected by Franklin's magic brother.
Facing FETÖ in Macedonia
Macedonia State Secretary-General Furkan Chako said they took steps to legalize the distance between FETÖ countries and to initiate the necessary questions.
"All of this is known in the community," he said, remembering that there were activities in the media and in the business world in Macedonia.
The Turks here don't give their children to FETÖ schools anymore.
And we're calling our people so they won't send their children here anymore.
He used to say, "This building that has benefited from the people's lack of faith and their well-being is well known by the common people."
The sky will be exposed to meteor rain
TÜBITAK National Supervisory and Estonian University of Astronomy and Space Sciences Professor Dr. Hasan Esenogülu said he would reach the highest level on Friday, August 12, when Perseid spoke to AA.
With the influence of thousands of pieces of solar light and radiation, the star called "Swift - tuttle" showed that Perseide created the atmosphere of the sky.
In fact, Perseide said that it was first discovered in 1862 and that it began to be seen again in the world since the 1990s.
Essenoglu, who said that the rain of the Perseide sky may be observed in the summer and August months, "We need to look at such a visual style from a distance and be interested in it."
So this is a natural painting.
He said, "The universe will be a better place for us to get to know each other."
When it's cold red, when it's hot, it's white light.
In fact, considering that some of the pieces cut during the rains in the sky will fall to the ground at a great rate, he continued:
Perseide fat can reach up to 2,000 centimetres.
Because of the heat and humidity in the atmosphere, the Perseides produce light in the natural environment when red and when warm.
The International Heavenly Organization can be found in the scientific library by writing about how many heavenly bodies are seen on its website.
This data is valuable because it's collected everywhere in the world.
He'll be able to watch all night.
Essenoglu, who remembers that the sky is moving at about 60 miles [60 km] per second, said that he could be observed in a good way all night from less bright places to the north of this visual tower in the sky.
Essenogül, who recovered the rain from the sky over 100 years ago, reported that after the rain of Perseide, Geminid recorded that it would be a natural occurrence to monitor the rain of the sky in 4-17.
Little educational old football game Erdoğan
When this wave broke out, the popularist leader Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, who was the leader of a small school football team, won more than a high-level student from Fetullah Gülen, a large-scale religious participant in Tashkent, Texas.
This is the translation of a week ago in a foreign policy article.
Erdoğan, an educational and old footballer at the university's post, and Gülen's first post is often referred to as a wide-ranging input, and these and similar articles are published in the West.
And then they're trying to explain in the main articles "Why does America and/or the West rise in Turkey?" "Because Erdoğan..."
It is possible to think that the West in Turkey is familiar with Turkey's history of analysts who consider themselves to be a nuisance in the era of Erdoğan.
In fact, in terms of statistics, the first ten years of the Erdoğan period may be read as a time when the contrast between the West in Turkey has decreased or remained in the middle.
Zira has been in good contact with the European Union and the United States of America for the past ten years.
The fact that Erdoğan's "one-minute" campaign against Israel has been carried out in Syria, that the Esad regime has failed to bring an end to the internal conflict, that the EU has not been involved in any real policy and that Turkey is left alone in the civil crisis, that some ideas such as "We are not here" by the European Parliament's President Schulz, that the war against the United Kingdom is opened and that it is now the President of the Islamic Republic of Great Britain, and that it is now a sign of the struggle of the foreign powers of the Union, that the Turkish parliaments of PKK's troops from the country are not ours of PKK's troops, and that the Turkish authorities are not of the right-hands of the right-hands of the right-hands-of-of-of-rights-of-of-rights-rights-rights-of-of-of-rights-rights-of-of-rights-of-rights-of-of-of-rights-rights-of-of-of-of-of-of-rights-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-of-the-of-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-and-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-of-the-the-the-the-and-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-the-the-and-of-and-and-the-and-of--of-of-of-of-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-of-of-of-of-of-the-the-the-the-the-
Let's say that when we lose 247 people, we forget that there is no support for democracy until the failure of the U.S. and the U.S. government, which we fear, and the failure of the U.S.
Well, since 11 Charlie Hebdo was killed in Paris, how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world have been involved in protests in Turkey, but 247 people who have been tanked for democracy have been killed a month ago, despite the fact that no one in the Baltic country has come to Turkey 'mutefix'?
What do we say to the presidents who came several times a year for the question of the speaker or those who sent out high-level delegates to send low-level representatives?
How do we evaluate the fact that all U.S. and U.S. officials have visited the past and that they will not be found on a confrontation visit to the Great Millet Memorial in Bombalo?
Is it not very strange that, in the first two weeks of working in Egypt, the EU's top-level trade leader, who has been busy with Sissi and Kerry's post-harvest visit 'democratic reconstruction', who has raised his labour governance in Turkey, is not aware of the fact that the Baltic countries that refused to support democracy in its return to Turkey are concerned about each advantage of Turkey's democracy?
Even though the people of 95% of the population are now allowed to live free in the United States, which they consider to be the responsibility of the guard, they are now able to expel the Turks.
And if the background plan I think above is added to it, I think it's obvious that the rise in West/American resistance to Erdogan alone cannot be explained.
Furthermore, Erdogan didn't even say that he thought the U.S. effect was still on the scene...
So we thought it was never a surprise.
Can Travellers who see their own people, who say, "It's a number of earthquakes," who don't think of themselves as "The Strangers Who Lose Their Blood," steal from the same language even after December 15th?
Have they answered the question "Where did we go wrong?" after they saw how this people got into the state and democracy?
But there's so many questions that need to be answered?
Those who have taken responsibility for all kinds of steps to Earth and have been given the right to use the State's weapons have once agreed to enter the "Hain" status and have sought refuge from foreign states.
We have to see how we live in a spiritual climate of corruption and how the backdrops of apostasy has led people to wrong conduct.
When the brains of the tired are on the way to Darbe...
Did Turkey's borders for those involved in this action have an opportunity to look beyond the borders of Syria?
Why are they bombing the parliaments of their own country?
We should probably not fall into a mistake like waiting for smart behaviors with FETÖ's beds.
The others are responsible, but we know that everything is not just about FETÜ.
Also, those who have sought politics as an example of war, crime, and hatred have made necessary contributions to the elderly.
And they say not of their own selves: "Be" - but they believe that every kind of conduct is out of harmony, and even that which is out of nature is out of nature.
When those who hated their people were given a gun, We saw how they opened fire on them.
The path of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying a very simple thing: on 15th of September in Turkey, FETÖ gave 250 towns to civilians, prisoners, soldiers, and many of them to save democracy.
But after 15 December 1992-2002; 2002-2012; and after 2012 there are three times.
There are three changes that have been made in these three times: economic, social, political.
The social change has been prepared by two major factors: the transfer from the coastal area to the metropolis and the transfer of these movements to the centre after they've been around for a very long time.
I indicated on Wednesday that this move was by metro.
I also stressed that the most important element of social change is not to say "metro."
And the second big change that has proved the same thing is bridges and roads.
It's easier to figure out what the road and the bridge bring to modernization.
It's coming, it's changing economic and social structures.
And we've changed the political structure so much.
I've seen this story with the bullets fired over the Boghaz in Istanbul since I left.
Demirel made the Big Red.
This was the baby in the 1960's after 1950's village movement.
In the past, the same progress has now been made with the second bridge we have changed as the 15th of November.
Even these road signs show the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of how social change has been monitored.
Demirel and Ozal's plan was to break the big bullets into the center.
I'm going to give them my central ideology.
The AK Party hasn't done its third birthday for many years.
Because the move was moving fast.
The people who came were placed on the floor.
A somewhat closed system was established in those areas.
The local government of the AK Party has given people the status of money, work, social status, and they are also in favour of the AK Party.
So the whales didn't want to be in the middle of it, they wanted to do their political sciences around and then come to the center as their own.
This event was related to ongoing competitions in front of the AK Party (1992-2002).
These conflicts recognized the need to stand side by side rather than to bring together people who are confused, confused and isolated.
After 2002, the AK Party stepped into politics by acting in the way I had defined it, joined the political party, and improved it.
After that, note now that the democratic struggle in 15th of December is the same with the building of the 3rd Kührer.
So history and sociology are all over.
I'll add another size: AK Party's brains are not limited to Istanbul bridges.
It's more interesting: AK Party is now filling the surrounding fields with central chains.
It's also provided by two canals.
One, the Osmalazi Summit.
Two, Tianakale 1915.
Add paths.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Trakya to another port.
Do you know what that means? Izmir will be a little bit of a bumbuck after this.
Let's say the AK Party will take Izmir out now that he didn't get 'in'.
Now, Bursa, now in Chanakakak, now the Trakya cities will become more and more civil and social havens.
That's it!
15 The perfect cities are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie's and her husband's idea in Fenerbach.
Fenerbahce, the Grasshoppers took over the preparations of the game with the training he had done in the morning.
The technical director at Can Bartu Tesisleri, who started training at 10 a.m. under the direction of Vitor Pereira, spent a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
In the hall, he made two rounds of rounds and follow-up to the 30-minute Korean training.
The trainman was finished with two rounds of matches made in the black field.
Fenerbaeus, he'll take care of his preparations with the training he's going to do tonight.
The guy who accused Gülen of being a little star...
New developments are taking place with regard to the Chiche Operation headed for Fenerbach.
A program published in CNN Turkey and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ, journalist Hüseyen Gülerce, "The name of a sports world named Fethullah Gülen has grown words about itself by the Azizi Star."
He said, "One day on the plane, he said, 'What do you have with your Fethullah Gülen?'
And when he handed these words to Gülen, he went to Fethullah Gülen and Aziz Star.
Why did he go to the Little Star?
If the head of the club, which is the most side of Turkey, is in this attitude, it could harm himself.
He used the expression "the Shike case was to celebrate the Aziz Star."
An explanation of these words came from Faik Light, one of the most important lawyers of the Čeche Dawse.
He went out to the Anti-Fraud Programme published in the Light News and explained the person who accused FETÖ Head Fatullah Gülen of the Aziz Star.
Here are the words of the Fair Light:
Little Star, Ihsan Kalkavan says something about Fethullah Gülen.
When it comes from Azerbaijan, it's on a special plane.
He's a very clever man, and he's talking about boring things when he's doing something.
Well, those broken pieces may be a bit of a mess.
Some of those keys can be used to show some of them.
These ingredients are grown somewhere.
It's not a matter of going there like Hakka's going to Umre. It's not gonna be so nice to go there.
What they say is it's really heavy.
It's not the only problem.
Meanwhile, they're testing a football team.
Some footballers and managers from the Galatasaray Club have real connections and thank Hakan...
Muharrem Usta: Čeki's issue is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta has extended his friendship to Fenerbach.
"We're on the side of this country with 79 million," he said.
We need to conduct a thorough trial.
If there's a problem with FETÖ FENERBAHZ, if there's any injustice, I'm behind FENERBAHZ.
"But there's a difference between Trabzonsport and Fenerbach."
Opened sacrifice prices
Karabult said to them: "We have identified the total cost of living tax per kilogram of living tax as 18 litres."
He said, "We've detected the price of the two and the price of the second class of 17 lira and the price of the second class of the mother as 15 lira."
Carbult, who was concerned about the sale of animals that would not be sacrificed last year, said that he should pay attention to the victim's victims:
In particular, animals need to pay attention to the earring.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
They can check the animals' passports when they take their victims.
The victim's life and life must have fallen off the roofs on the outside.
You don't have to be known as a whore.
We've seen animals that haven't been sacrificed in the past years have also been sold and sold.
A sacrificed animal must be two years old.
We can understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
A 2-year-old animal we're dealing with as a cat.
But the younger animals didn't have these teeth.
The animal can be seen as big, but it may not have been seen.
And their teeth are separated because they're already older than others.
The Rize Air Force will be put in the sea.
The second airport to be built in Turkey by sea will be Rize Air Force.
The Rize Havaliman will be built on the seabed of 26 and 32 metres from the list when it is 266 acres between the village of Eşilkóy and the village of Bashilkoy.
Because there is more depth in the construction of rice air, about 3 more layers of cargo will be used in the Army-Insurance Air Force.
At the project's capture, it will be built with piston at 45 meters and 3 000 meters long.
In addition to the Rize Airport, which will serve passengers and cargo aircraft, the compositional class D is expected to provide services to aircraft of over 150 000 kilograms, the heavy turbulence class D.

It's gonna cost 600 million lira.
Overwork will also be carried out with 150 million litres after subterranean operations, which will capture the terminal buildings.
It'll be completed in two years and nine months.
Motorine 8-inch tank
I've distributed a lot of money to the companies that's been through half this night, and they've done eight rounds of work on the engine's lithium.
According to the information received from the Petroleum Union Trade Union (PYS), the average price will be 8 rounds in the list of motor vehicles scheduled for August 13, 2016.
Therefore, the average litre in Ankara is 3.68 litres of the engine will rise to 3.76 litres.
The average engine price in Istanbul will be 3.63 litres of 3,71 litres of 3,66 litres of 3,74 litres of Izmir.
The prices identified by the distribution companies can show a slight change in prices, acceptance and freedom of choice for companies and farmers.
I've had four rounds of time for the lithre of the engine last week.
Galatasara dolls in Golen's chat room
On one occasion, Galatasarai and the international footballers who had hit the Turkish football team came into the middle of Fettullah Gülen's conversation in 1996.
The 1996 vision of Fetullah Gülen's football player, Hakan, Mert Fearma, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Win Tünker and Joseph Tepek is clearly known.
In his talk on Gülen, he used the expression "we won four hands" from Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, also known as FETÖ's former football priest, was quoted as saying in the SABAH newspaper "Turkey's third World Cup in 2002. "
Emre, Okan, Hakan Thank you, Hakan Counsel and Arif collected money from these primers.

Robert Amsterdam's very impressive statements about FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam &Partners, an official of the Amsterdam &Partners Law firm, who is investigating the illegal activities of the FETÖ (FETÖ), has shared information on how FETÖ is organized by an article in the U.S. history of Forbes.
FETÖ President Fetullah Gülen said that he managed an organization from his property in Pennsylvania, Amsterdam, "when Gülen looked closely at how he worked for about 150 words (charter) schools in the U.S."
Amsterdam, seven months ago, when it was commissioned by Turkey to investigate Gülen-related companies and schools, pointed out that what they found so far had been "cooling".
Amsterdam held the following meetings in the article:
According to the intelligence of the miners, there's a lot of hysteria related to Güllen's training.
These exercises usually take place at the hundreds of meetings held in Poconos with Gülen and Poconos.
There's a management group of seven people on the floor.
This group of trainings is being transferred to the speaking committee.
From here he goes to the priests of the district, to the priests of the land, to the priests of the land, to the priests of the year, to the priests of the district of them, to the priests of the valley, and to the priests of their teaching, and to the teachers.
They work at different levels according to their positions in the organization and their support.
Most importantly, in the world, 55,000 jobs are open, and Amsterdam, which has the largest agreed school network in the United States, has been paid every year millions of dollars from the taxes paid by U.S. employees.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money was directed towards its members and was transferred to "chosen" companies.
Amsterdam explained this with the following examples:
The Magnolia schools established in California, Gülen-related and the same-office company, were arrested at $700,000 for the annual service contract.
Amsterdam, as another example, showed the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam reported that this school paid more than $3.1 million to the owner of the property, as well as in the audits, and that the management of the owned company had been found to be of the same person in connection with Gulen.
Amsterdam, which is the largest in the Gülen network of 46 schools of harmony, pointed out that money was paid to smaller companies associated with FETÖ, such as the free-of-charge software license.
Amsterdam, drawing on the bottom of what one of the FETLE has done, says, "These examples I've given are showing that US tax agents are being abused for about 28 million dollars."
"It's part of what we've found so far," he used the expression.
Amsterdam, who points out that there has been nothing done to prevent such events so far, has reminded me that the situation in my previous language is getting worse, all of which has begun to investigate the irregularities of the Texas Education Agency.
Amsterdam pointed out that schools seem to work normal, that many workers do not find any information on what kind of weaknesses they are.

Watch Your Children’s Attitude
Dr. Bilgin Giray, Professor of Dental Medicine, said that they were able to take care of this reflection because children were unable to perform abortions in the first few years.
Dr. Giray, who organized the reasons for breast-feeding in children, said, "The breast-feeding is an event that has been seen since I was 3-4 years old."
Most babies don't get pregnant.
The child who gives his finger to meet his mother's needs while he's still a baby doesn't give his finger to go and rest after 1-1.5 years.
He said, "When you are pregnant and breast-feeding, when you are sleeping, when you are pregnant, and when you are separated from your mother, your finger can be found in your mother's behavior."
Dr. Bilgin Girey, who pointed out that the mother-in-law's fingerprints seen in the years ahead, had not developed enough confidence in her relationship with the mother-in-child, explained the effects of this behavior on her teeth:
The behavior of your fingertips shows an effect we're not forming in your child's teeth.
When the prints that come out during the mother's womb eventually die on top of the teeth, the lower teeth are also killed.
This will also lead to the location of the bottom line, the bottom line, the bottom line, and the bottom line.
But this physiological decline is in the form of speech disorder and loss of hearing.
Dr. Giray, who noticed that a much more complex treatment process could occur during a period of six to seven years when there was no early solution, "We can protect our children from closure and additional problems until the development of our children is complete."
"That's why children in our day need to be under control, such as eye and hearing controls," he concluded.
New challenge in the nearby field: Trifokal Lensler
After cataract therapy, patients don't want to use glasses naturally.
For many years, very reasonable measures have been in place to address this problem in our patients.
In recent periods, the triumphal movement has taken a further step towards the success of the treatment in this area.
The trifocal lens is not only a distant or close range but also a feature of pure contact in the areas identified as the intermediate range.
Remote, near, or intermediate look-ahead
The distance between our sights and our daily life represents a very common point in our lives.
For example, the vehicle display panel is the computers that we can carry in our pocket or the distances that we identified as 60-70 cm arm length.
They don't need to use surveillance in any way, either close or far, because the trifocal lens has also corrected the interlocking stages of our patients.
Another advantage of trifocal mercenaries is lowering their complaints at night.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeric "There is no difference between the trifocal lens treatment used for each tripal therapy."
Our patients we've been using trifocal therapy have been able to have a 7-to- 10-minute procedure.
And the next day our patients can return to normal life.
It is a high quality of life for people who use cars in particular, who prefer to read and enjoy computer use, and who are more active in life.
In addition, you can apply this procedure to every patient who is 18 years of age to see if it is appropriate for you.
It's not used for a different heart condition!
Varis, in the last few years, the frequency has increased to a higher level of disease.
It's a legacy where genetic proximity is leading; long hours of work, long-term work, and long-term work are required to stop.
Do breast cancers work in their heart surgery?
I have a difference, what do I do when I'm in a crisis of heart? Like questions are often asked by people.
That's the answers to these questions.
There are two types of clustering system in nature:
1. There's a system of deep clustering that takes blood into the liver and collects basic blood from the leg.
These are called deep femoral veins and facial femoral veins.
The problems in these groups are more noticeable, they can't shut down their patients, and drug treatments are used to keep them open.
There's a physical system that takes in the blood into the veins and we call it a side route with the deep funnel system in the neck.
This system is made up of two big habits and two small defenses.
In all four of these cases, there may be a lack of resources and an inheritance.
Heart surgery is a large-scale series of groups that are used for the heart operations.
There's no harm in the absence of these veins, and that's why they can be used for heart surgery.
However, these veins need to be healthy so that they can be used in heart surgery.
Because heart is a very important organ.
It reduces the burden of work and ensures that the legs are more healthy.
A wrong belief among the people, and a legacy of inheritance, will be made available to them as food for the donkeys.
Variance never gets used and never will be used in heart surgery!
There are other drugs that can be used in heart surgery.
Cardiovascular system systems that can be used in heart surgery; under the head of the brain, around the neck and neck.
So it's not appropriate to wait and worry about using the inheritance ring for the heart.

We've got plenty of gas.
This tragedy reminded us once again of the fall of democracy, not the need to fight in these lands, and the need to remain silent.
On that night, Turkish sports representatives also stood up with one voice, with one heart against the country; they always took their seats alongside the democracy.
In these critical days, we need more than ever to be able to combine sports.
I would like to see President Solomon Seba, the most valuable leader of our team, the second anniversary of his death, and our club's headman, Mr. Turga Sheren, to be the first player in the Turkish sport of love and peace.
I hope that the winner will be our country and the Turkish sport at the end of the machine that will be played in front of the teams that will be part of the Galatasaray and the Party.

Scott Callum Skinner is flying home while he's hiding from Britain.
When the Great Britain Team won the prize they won from London in 2012, Scotch Callum Skinner, Rio fought men during the race last night.
Glassowlu, 23-year-old warrior, took over the former role I was given by Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and this young, well-arranged New Zealander brought home this statement.
In the activity that Hoy took five of the six Olympics, four years ago, Britain took a shock.
And even though Hoy's been a hero, they won this in the sixth season of the World Championship, which was held in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was that the science beginner was not changed by Jamie Staff.
That's exactly what they did when they came out in the middle of India.
Hoy's work, Kian Emmadi, and Matt Crampton's attempt to fill up.
Scott's already realized his potential, and the British coaches didn't quit Skinner.
Four years ago, the Chinese, Kenny, and Skinner, who were champions with Hoy, broke the Olympic record.
And the British three, went out for gold.
Indis, even though he was a little back in his own way, Kenny's team came up with it, and Skinner was up to it.
It was a major change in the strategy by using a much larger tool to slow down India's pace, especially Kenny and Skinner.
Hey, BBC looked at them as a scientist, and when they went out of my podium, they looked at Skinner, Kenny and Hindi.
Glassowlu, 23-year-old Skinner said, "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do the best I can and make my name known.
We finally broke the Olympic record and won the world's championships.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to get this.
In 2012, he admitted that after he gained a fortune with Kenny and Hoy in London, he had a bad start.
And then he reacted to this move, and there was no way to be in demand from Britain's agents.
This time, there was no such thing as this for an incredible victory.
He said, "We were like London with all the Great Britain branches in Stan. "
It's just a team set up three months ago.
We've lost so much of the world's war, so it's really incredible to have won again in the Olympics.
It's just an activity for a country that won its 10th prize in London.
If the progress we've shown in the last five months is measured, he's waiting for us five more days to succeed in the race.
The fact that Kenny's been me shows that Hoy's only Olympic winning three gold records are not very likely to be won.
This is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and he was born on March 23rd (at the same time Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born, a sacred history of British sports) and he was born to six gold medals and a silver medal.
This means the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, after that, he's going to sprint; the race will start today and he'll take three days.
Boltonlu, 28, said, "Now I just enjoy it.
Team activities are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
If you have to be honest, you feel alone when you win.
He said, 'If two more shall be gained by gold, then thou shalt be given power over them.'
It's just this day's work, but there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul were the first to conduct the four-mile course.
The track was completed at 3:51,943.
The world's record of the gold medal won in London in 2012 at 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (2:42) will be set out in the second section today and will certainly focus on all the attention of Wiggins.
There was a disagreement with the authorities when he called on the authorities to measure his position.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milgavia reached the world record for women's activities to continue and complete tomorrow at 4:13.260.
The Great British team trusts a strong bicycle team to take the lead in the middle of the Olympic Games and win many prizes.
After a great victory in Beijing and London, the waiters in Rio were greatly reduced.
In the background, technical director Shane Sutton has had many bad developments that resulted in the use of such important names as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton for sexual and violence crimes.
But the first night after the battle in the battle, it shows that the resistance to the end of Great Britain can be demonstrated again this time.
Doubts about the future of Portland's successor with the iptal of the energy agreement
The work of hundreds of workers coming from the Portland aluminium in Victoria has become uncertain after one of the owners of the infrastructure agreement has been able to explain the fact that one of the owners of the energy supply company's all-initial agreements will open up.
This movement came into focus at the beginning of this year's decision by the government of Victoria to continue its work on the part of the government.
The 20-year-old stable substation is in August.
Alcoa may be at work in Portland until 2000.
Any closure process may be caused by the fact that the business is either directly or in whole or in part at risk.
And it's possible that Victoria's high school may be a result of ignitional ignitions because of the total power of about 10 percent.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed his lecture, and this led to the closure of the energy center in England last year.
Alcoa's tax on Portland's tax is losing money and facing the risk of closing.
These developments have been in the middle of several years to strengthen Australian dollars and soon to form part of their share of the loan.
AGL, which provides energy from the Loy Yang A power plant located in Latrobe Vadisi, expressed the hope that the other three owners would be able to enter into the process of concluding their talks.
A large majority of these products are owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and China's CITIC, and Japan's Maruben Corp companies are smaller.
"AGL is waiting for Portland's body to continue its work; this means that the victim's physical electricity demand will continue."
AGL expressed "risk assessment agreements" that were required to enter into the negotiations since March 2016.
Since the term is a 12-month period, they will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said, "That's why AGL will continue to wait for the agreement to be established in the financial year 2017."
The effects of AGL's financial year 2018 and subsequent potential gains are limited by my having a strong promise for global electricity prices.
AGL indicates that the value of the transactions in their accounts is now down to $187 million.
Alcoa stated that the decision to conclude the agreements "does not affect Alcoa's ability to use or control her electricity to read her. "
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was required to enter into force this year in August but did not explain why it was not yet withdrawn.
Analysts, both in Portland, Victoria, and near Newcastle, point to the possibility of closing up the economic difficulties in the sector of Tomago.
This week AGL's operating charge for analysts, Stephen Mikkels, told Portland that there are approximately 600 megagates per year, and that tomago uses 900 megagate energy.
If both of these funds are withdrawn from the market, it will be possible for them to fall within the value of the demand in the [electric] market.
And it's not gonna be a good development for us as a producer."
Not just the star of Cardassian TV program; at the cover of Kendall, Vogue's July number
The fourth daughter of Krist's Kardashian-Jenner group, Kendall Jenner (20), the mother and manager at the end of July, waiting for four searches by the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who was an Easte Lauder's brand messenger and who was present in Milan, Paris, and New York fashion weeks, heard this news from Instagram on Friday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this lock in a room full of people I loved."
After the opening of the door, the entire Cardassian-Jenner family (the problem was Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show world uncle, Keeping Up Manufacturer Ryan Seacrest) was released in a scenarioal reality video. In the video, one of the classics who had forgotten their sister's cover was actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is a click story line for almost every "birthday" section of the children's television programs (Seacrest 8th morning, "Do you think we missed you?") Chris, other girls should have included this recognition in a way.
We must have entered a new Cardassian cycle with this developments in Vogue's July number.
Kendall's sister Kim may have passed it on to Vogue's roof (the door was shared with Kanye West in November 2014) but it was a success at the beginning of the July summit.
Vogue's number was the biggest sales of the year.
From a fashion story, she drew attention to the fact that she had placed a lot of coffee on her desk. (Fashionista, found that advertising was included in the 632 - page book of the previous year.)
It's also a time that's been closely monitored by the explanation of the night star; the pictures of the last two years are taken out before the official hearing.
There are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss among the women who were previously placed in prison.
In recent years, many "models" have been replaced by "modalized" models.
Oscar's distinguished Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was arrested in 2013, and the following year he was named Lady Gaga.
However, in the case of Ms. Jenner's previous category, which was known as "parcel model" by her offspring by data, it can be said that her environment is very good.
These celebrants are not today's young people because they're either close to famous people or actually show stars or good Snapchat videos.
These are all women who are skilled, who are in the entertainment sector.
Beyoncé, who took place at the end of last year, spent one of the best days of his career with the exit of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
Because of the realite show history, Jenner's fashion world will always be disturbing.
In the month of the visit, the original Victoria's Secret model named it "the ruins of time" by quoting Stephanie Seymour, Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid.
When the news of Jenner's coming out of Vogue's lock, this thought came back to his face.
But there seems to be no place to be concerned about nonconformity.
Kendall Jenner, on the cover of Vogue's July number.
She's a super-model with the full meaning of her word.
He's on his way to Marc Jacobs' office.
He's taking you from the Estee Lauder fund.
She sells her own pictures on wall-based pay-related applications with her and her sisters.
Cindy Crawford, who took pictures of her daughter, sells her photos to the LVE story.
And when it's empty, maybe only her sister Kourtney and her children are actually on TV to see.
Global legal support centres turn 160,000 people every year
While the sector is preparing to create more than one financial crisis in currently under way in forced operations, over 160,000 people from its most vulnerable state are returning from the public legal support centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly elderly, migrant workers, defenseless workers, those who do not have access to justice and the like) turn back to free legal advice and representation.
The public legal support services that have destroyed their events are being prepared for more.
This legal support centre, which we've been planning to lose more than 30 percent of federal funding, is scheduled to be abandoned in the month of July.
The National Court of Justice, Director of the Queensland Centres, James Farrel, has announced that thousands of people have been found to have been converted every year by the National Court of Justice.
Mr. Farrell said that the federal government's decision would make the situation worse.
"Queensland's public legal support centres receive insufficient financial support in a chronic way, which means that thousands of people do not get the life they need," he said.
People who are involved in a relationship, who struggle with power and trust-building forces, whose families are out of work in an unfair way, are facing all of these legal issues and are unable to get the help they need in this report.
The federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent since July 2017 and this means that thousands of Queensland's state of safety will be left without aid from more complex legal problems.
We call on the Court of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to get back these financial appropriations immediately so that people can receive the support they need when they face a legal problem.
In the past year, the government has implemented its commitment to the national media system to finance its legal support.
We must now look to the public legal support centres and the communities they serve to do this important work by the Palaštuk government.
Donald Trump's campaign team was accused of following the idea that the staff had fired the gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team, North Carolina's director of operations, was accused of not being found in any action after he told anyone that he had fired his gun in the month of February.
Vaka, an ex-educator at the state campaign on Sunday, was found in a case opened by Vincent Bordi in the state court.
Bordini said she was expecting him to be involved in the situation for months but then she said she realized that "this isn't going to happen."
According to Bordini's complaint, Director Earl Philip "has pulled out a gun, put his right finger on his right hand and pointed his finger at Vincent's neck."
According to the school, Bordy found out that at least four people lived in the same experience as Phillip after he complained to local and regional campaign leaders.
"There's no need to be shot in order to destroy weapons."
The case was opened two days after Hilary Clinton's election and the election of the President of the Community to the majority in North Carolina, "The Second Anayasa Change Men" (as understood by the arms owners and arms supporters) and the election of their own judges.
Trump's campaign team said that the media appreciated these words outside of connection and that they didn't support their violence.
Bordeaux, with his complaint, I'm probably looking for an explanation from the campaign team and the attack, the strike and the mansion of Phillip.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks didn't turn the message into a fast way of making it work.
The efforts to reach Phillip have been futile.
WCCB, a local news reporter in Charlotte, said Phillip was out of the campaign a short time ago.
The call made to the Innovative Consulting Services was not made as soon as it was made.
The president of the Republic is working on a campaign that created a conflict between Donald Trump.

"FETÖ" failed
The MlT and Emniyet FETÖ made a follow-up to the call of President Erdoğan "Everyone can't know history, they can't find security, you can't tell."
When thousands of FETÖs were fired from the institutions after the 15th century, new applications are also being started for the "secret crowd" team.
President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, who stressed the news that his client would be doing in the fight with FETÜ, said, "Your friends from that camp may be your friends, I say, to expose them."
You need to report to the prosecutors.
It's a vacation duty.
He said, "Everyone can't know history, can't know security, or can't reach it."
The work carried out was launched online by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Secretary-General and the National Intelligence Organization (IMT).
Therefore, those who serve FETÖ around the country will be able to contact the Organization for Security and the MIT through this application.
www.egm.gov.tr/pages/messages/messages, www.mit.gov.tr/boutline links will be kept in the form of a service.
The document will also be available to those who wish to submit a message served by the Security Council.
Again in the same application, the messenger will be turned to himself if he wants to.
The lawyer will be able to inform the Republicans of the years and years in which they will be able to contact the "155 Police Imdad" line.

Reconnaissance of the asset under review in the Commission
The Turkish Property Fund, which was expected to enter the world's largest funds, was removed from the law without a voice.
It was decided that the fund was not out of the control mechanism but was reconvened to the Commission without any change.
AKP's legal offer to Turkey's Property Fund is assessed at sozcu.com.tr by the CHP National Commissioner and Member Utku Plan and the Büddecom Commission, "We are certainly opposed to being held outside the Analytical testing mechanisms," he said.
The Turkish Property Fund, which the government has prepared for long-term resources for investments and projects, was removed from the law on the day of the meeting with the president's due date.
But today the AKP's offer has brought the plan and the Baltic Commission back together.
The member of the TBMM Plan and the Bütchen Committee of the CHP explained the concerns and concerns of the CHP regarding the provision of the Property Fund.com.tr Act.
He said, "When the foundation of this fund came to the board of law of the Committee of the Regions, he offered to be seen in detail by our former Prime Minister Zechariah Temisel, our concerns and concerns about the matter."
The government that accepted this meeting also withdrew the market.
The project came back to the Commission today in the same way.
He said, "The government seems to be making this very difficult for a week to be removed from Meclis."
He says that there must be a difference in the issue of the Property Fund law, "Our greatest concern about this law is the irregularity."
He said: "The property belonging to the village, the property of the farmer, the staff will come from the compulsory residence permits, the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the arrivals to be acquired without specialisation, is illegally converted into a structure that has no responsibility and no responsibility."
Russia, China and Körfez, which are founded by these funds, notes that the countries of China and the Körfez are oil comers and more than the market and that the fund is financed in this way, "but we have an open market."
That's why money will come from public resources, i.e. people's money.
A total of 100 billion of the unemployment fund is scheduled to be transferred from the single pension fund that is required for workers to pay 100 billion and 50 billion dollars without specialisation.
He said, "This fund that will come from the people's money will certainly be in my group's trial and must not spend it on purpose."
He explained his concerns and concerns about the provision of the Property Fund law, which was collected by the State resources, and which was claimed by state assets in debt, that a fund that was intended to be owned by the State could not be accepted without the Meclis audit:
The collection, cost and debt of such a large population cannot be transferred only to the management of independent management companies.
I'm glad he's got to be a team leader and a boss.
There are no rules on the investigation and protection of the property fund.
No limit has been set as to how much resources are transferred.
No one's gonna ask about how this phone was used.
The purpose of the fund is to show the need to finance large projects.
There's no need to set up an uncontrollable fund for this.
Why don't you take it in?
And then, naturally, the question is, "Why does the contest and the game get out of control?"
He went on to say that he did not oppose the transfer of money to investments while he was in the Property Fund, but that it was against non-profit and non-accountable mechanisms, he continued: "Can there be any need for such a fund?"
But if the Government insists on doing so, we have to ensure that international standards are in place in Turkey as well as in other countries where such investment funds are established.
It must be properly tested and configured in the way that the responsibility mechanism is carried out.
It must be set up in a way that will allow for the payment of his own money spent in the hospital until the last session.
The Property Fund has described the fact that they are definitely opposed to the law commission, "It's good that AKP is listening to what we're doing at Meclis after the 15th of December."
We hope that the AKP will listen to our manufacturer.

The President's Biennial Year, which was organised by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce at the Swiss Hotel, welcomed the people working with a teleconferencing meeting of the law "Trusters in Turkey, Producers in Turkey".
The President-in-Office, who said that Turkey is the sector's number sector to ensure its relative success, said, "We need to cut the number to 4.0 in the sector."

We have very similar goals.
It didn't ruin Turkey's economy.
The chaos and crisis waiters were wrong once again.
Today, our democracy is both our economy and ours.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work well.
In 2015, there was a 25-year-old drop in foreign trade.
The country you opened was 5.8 per cent in 2014, and it was 4.5 per cent in 2015.
We're going to drop to four at the end of this year.
We're never gonna change our tough situation in the village property.
Turkey's 2016 budget is now more than 130 countries' international revenue.
In 2015, we put the world's opening of over 11 percent of the bubbles into 1.3 percent, and we're trying to protect them.
We're better than the EU and many countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector is driving them to work in a safe country.
"The Central Bank didn't need to invest in the market, despite 15th of December, and we don't have any discounts on our reserves, but we have a double reserve of 121 billion dollars."
The President-in-Office of the Council, who announced that the development of the economy, the increase in production and the creation of new areas of demand would make it easier to do so, "We are also making comprehensive arrangements to rescue you from your past responsibilities."
We've been able to make a lot of adjustments in our lives until we get back to the amount of cash we've got from the stock market and the unpaid tax duties are reimbursed.
He said: Go on producing for the land, and rely on your land, and your government will continue to remove from you the obstacles.

Turkey is not from the West. It is not from the European Union.
Chimšek: Turkey is not from the West, it is not from the European Union
Bashbakan Assistant Minister of Science, Science and Technology Faruk was present at the "Trusters in Turkey, Producers in Turkey" legal meeting organized by the Economic and Social Council of the United States of America (ISO).
At the meeting, the Science and Technology Department, Mr Faruk himself, "I think there are many good results from the developments that took place during and after 15 December."
The most important of these is the unity and unity that all of Turkey feels at this time.
The 15th anniversary of Turkey's economic downturn showed how many healthy dynamics it had and how many democracys it had.
"The economy and democracy and democracy are clearly going to move faster and faster for a community that has adopted this level."
"TURKY'S SECURITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE SECURITY"
Economic Secretary Nihat Zeybek, who said he was forced to tell the world of 15 December, which came from Faruk Ozli, said that they had been involved in this issue as a government.
"If my first five-faced sector is going to phase 63.4, we have to concentrate on all our work on leaving this business."
Our chief's back for him and he's talking about this.
With the Reel sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the 15th century civil democracy, and together with Turkey, it needs to be saved from this tension.
In this respect, we welcome the recent developments.
He said, "In our time, we're going to realize that this recovery, which starts at nine zero points in the month when banks begin with our President's intervention, can be achieved by supporting this recovery, which starts down as eights, as well as by supporting it as economic management."
"YEY PASPORT, WE'RE GOING TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF OUR HOUSE"
"The winner of the world in our time, we will be trapped," said Nihat Zeybek, "We will not leave the country that has not been taken into the leadership of our President, nor will we leave the door unearned."
We won't let anyone we didn't contact about raising our ticket.
He said: "We will never do it, nor will we look after it; nor will we be of the birds who fly after it."
Zeybekski also used the expression "one of the most recent decisions that has come out of its law, and we have now completed it in economic terms; and we will give the first numbers to our first 17 to 20 thousand refugees, which represent the country, as close as possible."
"I mean, I'm going to have to do something about the development of my life."
Vice-President Mehmet Schimšek spoke about the 15th of December and then the OHAL, Vice-President Mehmet Schimšek, saying, "The fact remains, we need to look ahead."
Two simple reasons why the OHAL has been launched, says, "Of course those in this rise need to be cleaned out of the state of those who are involved in this job, and this process works; but more importantly, serious reforms were needed in order not to face up to this type of employment."
This is also a climate that is necessary for these administrative reforms, and so far there have been very serious structural reforms.
"As we do all of this, of course, we have moved within the democratic beginnings and the rule of law, we will continue to do it."
In a number of areas, Switzerland, which has expressed its view that life has returned to normal, pointed out that there is no least reason why companies and companies that are not involved in the financing of terrorism are concerned.
The Swiss "Bensen Turkey's democracy has been well-healthed by the demands on Turkey's democracy, because when you look at the root of the problems of the past, you will see that this fraud network is in operation.
He said, "The cleanup of this terrorist organization by reason of its state will strengthen Turkey's democracy during this period in Turkey."
Šimšek, who said that the foundations of the economy were generally healthy and had never been lost, returned to normal structural reform days, "Turkey has turned to the real day, and there has been progress in structural reforms."
We're not going to have any more structural reforms, because in the world, populism is increasing.
He said, "Turkey can only prepare for the future of reform."
Finally, Switzerland, which argues that Turkey will not go to the West, said, "The time of Turkey may be different from our time-consuming terrorists, our friends; but Turkey does not go to the West, it does not leave the European Union."

The wounded Karahan brothers were taken to the Kahta State Hospital with the ambulance.
Umer and Ramasan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency service, were not spared all their efforts.
When the bodies of two brothers were told by tomorrow for the autopsies, the police, who were tracking mobile and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began to work towards the capture of the identity of the attacker on a weekly basis.
Britain needs to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow's not only in our local communities and London, it's going to taste fresh and fresh in the country.
I think the incredible effort we put forth to provide for the benefit of all these countries and regions of the Games will make the Heathrow as well as London in 2012.
The Olympics, Stratford and East End provided great advantages.
And we can create opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We're only going to create 10,000 new stations for our local communities, 40,000 new jobs, and we're not gonna leave the airport unworked young.
Like London before 2012, those who think that Heathrow is too hard to deal with.
It was told me that Britain would never be ready for the Games and we'd be on vacation all over the world.
The suspects were mistaken in 2012, and they'll see that they're wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow, he shows all the questions he's asking.
Heathrow's not just a few people like the Olympics, it's a subpoena project for many people.
Enlargement, 180.000 new jobs and $211 billion economic growth opportunities and the environment leave much to be done in the United Kingdom.
In Heathrow, we have a great team to apply an investment of 11 billion dollars worth of electricity between the world's most recent two peaks and the world's best airport for five years.
Now, we're going to have a third pist that's supported by private investment at $16 billion.
London 2012 Games was a great success for the United Kingdom, and there is no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be that way.
It's time for us to be confident that we're going to come to a trade channel by extending the Olympic spirit to Heathrow and create a lot of hopes and work that Britain's proud to hear.
Lord Paul Deighton, Head of the Heathrow Management Board and Secretary of the Ticari Secretariat of the former Treasurer's Office
Adblock Plus, Facebook advertising like "Die-like" game
The online advertising program for companies that have won money is a "kedi-fare" game according to one of the companies that makes programs to prevent entry programming.
On Friday, Facebook announced a blog that only two days later Adblock Plus would be able to update its filters to prevent social networking.
On Saturday, Facebook said that it would change the advertising codes around the advertising site to force advertising to determine which part of the advertising page is advertising.
But Adblock says now he's solving new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this progress has been made since the creation of a reconnaissance of advertising from those who are trying to prevent open-source advertisements from the public" and that Facebook may soon produce its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in this struggle shows how much concern the advertising media have for the sector.
According to a work done by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people worldwide use advertising as a means of preventing advertising, and this is a quarter of the number of people using this type of software in 2013.
Mobile advertising with 1,03 billion mobile mobile users now generates 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to one dictionary, mobile advertising barriers have been followed by mobile applications of Facebook for social networks and advertising barriers on the company's desktop that have no effect on Instagram.
Facebook must be able to provide enough desktop advertisements, as it appreciates this kind of behavior.
On Saturday, Facebook explained that people will update the "advertising preferences" tool so they can better control their ads.
On Friday, Facebook announced that Adblock's new filters are concerned, and some of them will be blocked without advertising on the site.
A Facebook dictionary says to a brain made by e-mail: "I don't have a good experience with these people and we're planning to deal with this problem."
We are in a position to create tools like Advertising Preferences to give control to people.
A woman ran into a Swiss car, looks like an accident.
The victim was sleeping in the car half-night.
The police are looking for people who witnessed several car crashs on the highway on Friday morning.
The case came right after midnight at the Vaud Canton near Morges at A1.
The Vaud police told one body that she was sleeping in the darkness of the night and that several vehicles had hit her.
Several vehicles hit the 49-year-old Swedish woman who was apparently trying to kill herself.
He lost his life where he happened to be.
The police said that they met with several of the drivers involved but that some of them were not identified and that they wanted everyone involved to follow them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstutter, Le Tribune de Geneva, was found explaining that "a "reasonable" action to be taken in situations like this has been launched."
However, it is not yet known that drivers involved will not face any charges.
Was it possible to escape without an encounter?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find," Hofstutter said.
In the last five years, it shows that the drivers will not be held responsible.
In the newspaper, both ages (both included a person coming out of the car in the dark) were sentenced to wait half a night in the car to face a storm.
A year ago, one night in August 2014, A1 was found guilty of committing suicide by a police officer who had caused the death of a man on his way to Payen.
The court said that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and was on his way.
The court stated that the police memory that was used in an expensive way to report an urgent call and that the finding of a man on the way was "an inevitable exception and improbable situation".
Those who heard about this incident near Morges on Friday should call the police on the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: adapted to live for a very short time
According to the new NASA climate model, there were time-consuming refugees in Venus.
NASA has developed a model for researching the history of Venus using tools and algorithms such as the use of science scientists.
Model, Venus, hot, non-watery surface and a CO2 atmosphere were designed to determine that it did not have a houselike structure like the world.
Science was explaining to the people that Venus's decline in the past with the atmosphere base.
But the newest assumptions are that Venus could have an atmosphere like the world and could still return slowly.
He also looked at the topography of old Venus.
Although there are more solid areas than the Earth, the planet may have at times been able to protect itself from rapid conflict with sufficient water and geography.
At the same time, old Venus was using a more cheap sun in 30 percent.
The GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio, in a news release, said "The slow return of Venus to the GISS model made it almost two months to the east."
This also opened the way for the clouds that made up the cloud layers that moved the surface of the sun to protect it from heat.
As a result, there were only a few more colder climates in the world today.
Models made it possible for Venus to create a similar story that scientists once predicted as hypotheses.
As long as he had suitable living conditions, Venus had been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
He blew the oceanans off, and the water blew off with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen sank, and then it was just a carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere that had a deadly effect on the gas, which is, as we know it today, Venus.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy used Avalanche's antenna
Patrick Roy used Colorado Avalanche training and hockey operations as the lead aid on Friday, expressing that the team had not been given the right of word during the decision-making process.
The head assistant/general manager of Colorado, Joe Sakic, approved this development and announced that the club will begin to call for a new coach.
Roy, aged 50, said in his statement, "For the past three years, I have carried out my major training and hockey operations in Colorado Avalanche with energy, restraint and determination."
I've been thinking for a long time about how I can improve and how I can get a higher level by giving this team the depth they need.
To accomplish this, the horse and VP hockey operations must be in constant conformity with the vision of the structure of the vision.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect his team's performance.
In the present case, these fugitives have not been dealt with yet.
On May 23, 2013, the team thanked Sakic for his team's efforts.
Sakic said, "Patric informed me of my decision today."
He is grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and in the future we will have a great opportunity for ourselves.
Roy and Avalanche were awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best driver in the first season of 2013-14.
The club won 112 points and made the team finish its first league, but Colorado was back to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off season, and every two years he lost his post-season games.
Avalanche passed the 39-39-4 target in 2015-16 and received less than five points for the second gambling area at the Western Conference.
Roy, on the Honor List, won four Stanley Cup for the two Montreal Canadiens for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to meet with the grevi military
The North Sea oil workers were taken into custody because of their wages, and the main spokesmen began to argue for a new meeting.
Petroleum services are conducted in platforms in the North Sea, operated by the Grev Royal Dutch Shell against Wood Group.
"We decided to resume the process of resolving existing non-aggression as Unity and RMT syndicates with Wood Group," he said.
In the weeks ahead, we're going to set up a series of meetings that will take place all day so that I can have a new look at the problems we're facing from the beginning of the week.
Work unions have shown that this protest has been the first step towards a payment rate of 30 percent in 25 years.
Wood Group, this year, because of the pressure on the market, has made a 9 percent discount on payments made to shippers in the North Sea.
The company also applied a 10 per cent discount to its registered suppliers in 2014 after the reduction of the fee.
The company said it would provide the company with the area needed to pass through the difficult times in the market.
Shell, when the English energy company arranged operations with BG Group during the process of co-operation, had thousands of people out of work and had heard of plans for leaving oil and gas operations in the country up to 10 years.
Energy companies are under pressure because of a low and low oil prices resulting from a decision to withdraw from the European Union in the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson will discuss one of the biggest job differences in the North Sea in the beginning of this week.
As he said, the North Sea is important for the regional economy.
He said in a statement, "We need an active economy for the majority, not for minorities in the North Sea and the country in general."
Despite an average of about 7 billion dollars last five years, it is expected that less investment will be made on new projects in the North Sea in 2016.
Peppers measured the rotation speed of stars in the Earth's constellation star
Kepler's space telescope, with the final task of space scientists, helped create the most inexhaustible catalogue of stars in the Earth's galaxy.
The new data helps scientists to understand why stars in the constellations change rapidly and become interested in the evolution of the universe.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Research and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, said in a news section, "We hope that more information can be given about the relationship between the age, age and even the history of the solar system when we compare our effects with the constellations of stars."
The Earth's star team is 445 light years away from Earth.
Most of the stars on the team's star have been created 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of availability.
They're coming back as fast as they can for life.
As soon as they get back to the ground, the stars in this phenomenon are in the formation of a huge amount of solar wind.
These winds are designed to create an impact on the stars as they progress in the magnetic fields of the stars.
A star turns back and starts falling fast.
Peppers can be recognized as the speed of each star's return like the sun's clothing by measuring the distance between the appearance of the stars.
The most recent rate of return is that the larger stars are faster than the smaller stars.
Rebull has shown that those who are older than dancers are less likely to realize their changes on their sole feet than those who are smaller.
Rebull said, "We see that the world's slower in the waves is more difficult, and the faster are less stars."
Since the country team is very close to the star, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory task to compare its speeds with its star characteristics.
Rebull said "The country's star team is in providing theoretical models for star changes both young and old."
There's much more we want to know about how and when the stars turn back, when and why they fall, and why they leave their 'dance shoes' behind.
Rebull and his colleagues have explained in detail three new articles that will be published in the Astronomy Index in the short term on the most recent analyses of the country's rotation of stars.
