Fire destroyed in French chemistry work
The Great Fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen was destroyed. It shared with the Normandy Prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the accident. The fire was used with about 200 explosives.
The contents of the fire could be offered
Anrainers were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and childcare facilities were closed on Thursday. The chemical work at the top of it produces additives for lubrizole. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US-Millian Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety flags.
About 400 people are working in the work. The chemical factory has already provided for the past - about as of 2013 by a lake the gas methanthiol has disappeared and the environment has grown considerably after melting. In 2015 a fall of about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flows into the city's water system.
A woman preaches her job to look for 57 days after her lost dog
Two months ago a woman from Washington looked for her lost dog - and announced her job. Seven-year-old Border Collie was away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the dog every trace - but Carole King didn't get up.
"It was terrible. I got scared," said Carole King to the "Dayly Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they finally returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "It's about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King against "Dayly Inter Lake". When the auto entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their favorite dog. But from days to days they were gone. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Dayly Inter Lake", who announced their job as postman to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: a man reported and said that Katie was in his court. But when the king came there, Katie was already gone. She looked out the neighborhood and suddenly stood under a tree. "I just wanted to leave her. I didn't want to leave her," said King according to "Dayly Inter Lake." "The trains were floating. People kept on their cars, coming out and dying. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Lost at the Federal War: Machine gun disappears free of charge
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years the Federal Navy has lost a number of weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The stay is unclear in most cases. The opposition is speaking of a "facing" dimension.
Since early 2014, the team has been avoiding the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is based on a list of the Federal Defence Ministry which reports Germany's editing network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, up to two weapons, one gun and 3474 shooting ammunition have been recovered. In the case of the remaining six machine guns and parts of the MG3, 11 machine guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. There are also 30 guns missing for machine guns of type MG3.
The extent of the weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "abundant", said the left-wing Bundesday Officer Martina Renner. This is so much more so because in the course of investigations, something has been found. The left-goer spoke of a "need balance". Renner criticised that the list of the missing ammunition was not aware of whether those who were also found in connection with the investigations against the under-terrorist federal surgeon Franco A. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" lost Iranian port
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left today's port of Bandar Abbas. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker was in motion and left the Iranian port. As the target port was given by Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters for the first time. From the shipyard it was known that he wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was founded on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Seastraße in order to break down security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran had responded to the controversial, provisional imposition of an Iranian oil tanker before the British-owned Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important maritime routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil port is being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been enormously intense over the past months. The trade ship has been involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel deserves the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people to the DDR, who had been on the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In autumn 1989 brave citizens had brought the former DDR regime into the barracks, said Merkel at a party of the Thuringer CDU Group on the first day of the German unit in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupying of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away," she said.
Mouse is moving towards delivering record
Teslas Quarter may keep a record. Despite the delivery tree, there was last loss in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company the view of new records. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys", Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published in the "Electrek" section blog.
The request was strong, so Tesla 110000 orders could be booked, there was further written in Musks round writing. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible.
Incidentally, Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong has not been the course for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 will total 3000000 to 4000000 cars. In the coming four-year period, there will be six-digit numbers. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but there are few gains. Despite the last loss of the tree.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kill ourselves
A kind of Bremse in Großhirn prevents people from kicking themselves. This was found by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin using experiments on rats as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question why children are so fiercely opposed to the kitzels just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the presence of a cat’s hand has already been released before the treatment of the lions. This is on a deeper layer in the big brain, which is already opening the lake at the time of the waiting of the kitzel.
According to earlier studies, rats with "laches" in the ultrasound area reacted when they were slaughtered by humans. This "laches" will be communicated through the part of the large-scale spine which serves as the central processing of the haptic perception.
Lachen is under pressure during self-treatment
Until then, it has been concluded that the brain may differ between self-treatment and treatment by others - so that people cannot kill themselves. However, at the experiments on the rats, Berlin researchers found that the lakes are subjected to as much stress as the activity of the area of the major brain during self-treatment. This is also the case when living themselves. During the migration and breast-feeding by scientists, the activity in the brain and the pulse have been strengthened.
However, the self-treatment and the treatment by others at the same time are also suffering. This indicates that the brain of the Council cannot differ either between self-treatment or other treatment. The new findings showed that people cannot kill themselves because self-treatment activates a brake in the brain.
In addition, the rats were trained to kill themselves. In this way they sometimes released this initiative in the experiment, showing flight behavior or scratch stars. This ambivalentity is similar to that of children. The ambivalentity of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is similar to that of rats and humans.
Catastrophe rejected: Great Fire in French Chemistry
The large fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen was destroyed. It shared with the president of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out at night to Thursday.
According to authorities, no health-threatening substances should be exposed. The samples taken give no reason for the assurance, as President Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the event. The fire weapon was used with about 200 explosives.
Schools and childcare has been closed
People were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and childcare facilities were closed on Thursday.
The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US-Millian Warren Buffett
In the chemical work at the base of its work, additives are produced for lubrizol by US-Millian Warren Buffett and are subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly severe safety charges. Some 400 people work in the work.
The chemical factory has already provided for the past for the strands - such as by a leck 2013 the gas methanthiol has disappeared and the environment has grown considerably after melting eggs. In 2015 an operating drop of about 2000 litres of mineral oil flows into the city's water system.
Brexit: Johnson by his own sister criticised
The Premier's sister commented at the first meeting in Parliament after the end of the forced break on Wednesday. The Premier is concerned that, on 31 October, without an agreement from the EU, Brussels should not be allowed to comply with its requirements under amendments to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wishes to achieve it, it is unclear.
About Cox, which had been used for the stay of Britain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's mind and reunite this country would be to complete the EU's Austrian." Cox was killed during the referendum campaign by a legal extremist.
Oslo and Utöya attack cases are included
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths on Saturday in Norway, the monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron paintings. They remind of the roses that thousands of people had spent in the days and weeks following the attacks before the judgment in Oslo.
At the same time, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be completed - the roses were ridiculed by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. The opening will be expected among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first launched an auto bomb in the government district of Oslo and killed 77 people in connection with the Utöya Dutzende holiday camp on the island of Dutzende of the youth organization of the social Democratic Party.
Iran is free British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. However, there is now a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" established in Iran was able to land again in the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" established in the street of Hormus in Iran has been back in international waters since mid-July. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as revealed by the ship Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew is now, among other things, on medical research to Dubai, stated ship owner Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship has left the Iranian waters. "It's too late," he told the Swedish TV broadcaster SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker on 19 July under the pretext of violating the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members were already released in early September. The remaining 16 members of Crew went well, Hånel said. They had been professionally active in view of the difficult and deteriorating situation in the past ten weeks. The shipyards are now working to regroup with their families as soon as possible.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero" the British government challenged a similar reaction to a situation in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, placed on the chain. The delivery then devastated the authorities against EU sanctions against the Syrian country.
The Iranian spoke of "Piraterie" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released.
The road of Hormus is one of the world’s most important maritime routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world’s oil exports are being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been intense over the past few months. The trade ship has been involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several conflicts with tanks and drones.
The tension between Tehran and Washington is behind the nuclear conflict between the two countries. The US forces the Iranian leadership to attempt to build nuclear weapons. Iran shows it back. The United States was released in 2018 at the Allegation of the International Atomic Agreement that would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US Government has established leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to enforce a more stringent and wider agreement in other areas.
Because of the conflict about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working at a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace on the road of Hormus at the UN-Fall Conference in New York. Iran, with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, wants to provide Iran with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection for the safety of the ship in the Persian Gulf.
India hopes for a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal duty imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to relocate. Asian financial leaders who consider their production from China to another country call India a question of the U.S. as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only to do with the inequities of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role than it has been created in the globally well-known production chain.
However, India has now been awarded its own focus in Trumps. From Hautegen in the White House as "the kingdom of the Zülle", America has rejected trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The United States of America is prohibiting higher customs and requires better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motor vehicles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the preparations with India are free of charge. In addition, America looks at the world's largest democracy also through the security policy spirit. Delhi and Washington combines concerns about China's powerful language in the South Pacific. On this basis, a wave of American punishments against India is unlikely. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been in both a second five-year term of office, must therefore remain in safety.
The problem is in another place: The empirically stressed Thesis that open markets speed up economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. Its reformer is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic hierarchy, which has long-standing business spirit in the multi-racial state. Companies are now receiving faster building housing conditions. They are benefiting from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more sensitive insolvency and competition law creates conditions for making companies seem more vulnerable to high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, India has made a lot of use of it in the first five years of fashion. However, trade policy does not apply. In order to protect international little competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government has even created new barriers.
In the West, Modi of the Nimbas of the Energy Reformer, whose country is restored economically. This impression is not due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what Vokabular likes western managers. In the core, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to launch an anachronistic careers and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive their sectors are members of the nationalist Modis Bharatiya Janata Party's family and are accused of this short-term policy.
Acquisition by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French state president Jacques Chirac is to be completed next week in Paris. The former head of state will be held at the Peacehof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital on Monday, the news agency AFP reported calling on the Chiracs family. The property will be held in one family circle. For Sunday a public mourning festival was held in Paris, as media reported.
The competitor was aimed at: Dabo is the first secret hero of Lightothelik-WM
The world spot was already in the target when he was playing in the calming scenes of Khalifa International Stadium. During the first time the men hit Jonathan Busby from Aruba, he was at risk of changing. He could hardly hold on to his feet until 300 meters before the target, like Braima Suncar Dabo, who suddenly stopped him from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau and supported him with the last half of the stadium round in the target. The forces were able to stop after the finish run. As long as the scenes had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," Dabo said after running in the Mixed Zone, when he completely lost sight of the attention of the collected journalists on his own. Skeptics would not talk about his heroate at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one sufferer. And without it he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Federation. In normal circumstances, he would never have said, "I am proud to walk here for my country."
He did this on the night with nightmares - and much more intensive than he had thought it would be. Because this gentleman will remain in mind. Once Dabo’s competitors even took over the final place - the last five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race. It had not at all used anything at the end, since the busby had just been disqualified by the end of the world’s telecommunications network.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, took part in setting up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This took place according to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already in 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of people: Egypt stands up for wild protest days
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the face of possible government-critical protests. At Cairo’s centre of Cairo, a reinforced police presence was observed on Friday. Several railway stations remained closed and roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days the police had reinforced their road controls and had partially examined the phones of pedestrians on news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds of non-governmental organizations were reportedly arrested.
Against Al-Sisi
Last week it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, the critical of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against political leadership had not been given in Egypt for years. The Egyptian artist and actor Mohammed Ali, living in the Spanish exile, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook today, called for a "Millions March" at central places in the country. Ali demands a "People revolution". The man is for the young Egyptians even though he is not "buffers, because he is a soldier."
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase by two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) was more than 1.570 by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECSR) and the Human Rights Watch Human Rights Organization (HRW) spoke more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The Government also confirmed and commented on the figures.
Voluntary arrests
Many people were "willfully arrested" "only because they were 'for the wrong time in the wrong place'," HRW shared with legal prisoners when calling on law enforcement officers. The charges against the perpetrators were based on statements by their lawyers of "the spread of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities questioned and investigated security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW data.
HRW also criticised the census in the North African country. The government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to connect further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Senders should be able to easily spend their returns
For online dealers, there are many returned packages lost. About 20 million returns are on the market. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers like Amazon and Zalando how they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be exempt from the sales tax on trade, the Ministry stated on a question from the Green Bundesday Group which reported on the news of the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, traders could take the market value of non-sellers so low that they would not have to pay any or only a few sales taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the German citizens would return every six packages to orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - countries then in Müll. They would spend additional money after the current legal issue, as the financial authorities assessed cases as a trade tax.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an agreement that companies can properly assess non-sale products and spend free of charge on joint organisations. The companies had to be able not to be punished for expenses. This applies not only to online business, but also to other businesses from the modelling to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be expanded for the first time.
For Branciz, Banksys emphasised the work "the return of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world to the basic maintenance of animals and tribes". From Saturday the picture of Sotheby's in the British capital will be presented until it will be expanded on 3 October. It will be estimated at EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first presented in the Museum of Bristol in the south-west United Kingdom where Banksy lived. In this year, the artist redesigned the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work which had previously been "questioned" was referred to as "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Finally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the sub-house following the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to complete the double Brexit already transferred on 31 October without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, joined the Brexit debate. In Dover in southern England, he painted a picture that depicts a man who is wearing a single star of the European flag. The work is seen every day by thousands of Lkw drivers and other visitors on their way to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a space walk in the park
The violent attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gegner in Parliament did not contribute to a climate of the Hasse. Compared to the post-Brexit referendum 2016 election, the current controversy was a "space walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We (out of the EU) will be expelled and won".
Johnson had hit Brexit-Gegner in Parliament in the past few days and accused them of, among other things, "Consult" to the people.
Cummings said that the only way to regain peace was if the MEPs would finally respect the decision of the British to issue an EU Austria. It is not surprising that the people were surprised that Britain had not yet been represented three years after the referendum.
In view of the vote taken on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called back. "We should speak to each other with respect," he said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan requests Uno Enigrants in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmiri conflict at its first meeting.
On the other hand, it is likely that another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India will occur, Khan said on Friday at the Uni-General debate in New York. "If it is going bad, you hope for the best but you'll be ready for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You had to prevent it."
India and Pakistan have, since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, led three wars, two of which are related to the divided region of Kashmir. Both atoms dominate part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had rejected the independence status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased its tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the support of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts strongly. With sharp munitions against the people, it is possible to place more than 2000 prisoners in prison to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there. Protests were never dangerous in Egypt. However, since the adoption of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state parliament has done its best to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
However, one of the triggerers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, non-perspectiveness and the feeling that the government itself has to suffer are millions on the road. And this is a problem which neither the regime of El-Sisi gets into the grip, no matter how hard it goes against the cause. The situation has even deteriorated.
Since 2016, every third of Egypt has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the Supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is responsible not only for the oppression but also for the largest economic factor. The military is building streets, houses, football stadiums, producing food and much more. This has been done before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have much experience, also the dilemma in the Supermarket. Critically it will always happen when large quantities of water become too crowded.
Tüv Tests in Terminal: BER Chief: No "showstopper" for the main city airport
Two months were tested whether the complex plant function in the BER brand protection together. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This was safe, said Mr. Rainer Bretschneider, after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütte Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but he also said that there are still gaps in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the time plan until the start of the operation still contained buffer.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserves should not be too large. The construction index is now to be introduced in the first quarter of 2020 at the construction site, which was expected at the beginning of the year for this harvest.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be overcome; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for the flight operation, further intensive work must be done on the processing of the deficiencies," he wrote.
Lüke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is no permission for all the devils who hang on the cables. The airport chief expects this to be available for years.
In addition, fire protection is not yet satisfactory during the transition to the railway station. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking speeds that run down a fire like a lead wall so that the smoke does not spread. They are driving too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then a new experiment with heat from the start of the year will be made.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects, as well as planning errors, have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Initially, it should be operating in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion euros since the beginning of 2006.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to build the airport. This is why it should take place in a special session of the Supervisory Council on 18 October, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new business leaders. Financial chief Heike Fölster is changing at the end of the year to the German Bahn, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes to Rente next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automated for drugs - Police takes man fast
He needed money for drugs - and got some cars in Chemnitzer City area into the air! Now the father is finally in port!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking lots in Chemnitz and the region has increased dramatically. A million damage has occurred!
After two detonations in late May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the city street and on the next street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the conduct of explosive explosions in real-time unit with a particularly serious case of the theft conducted by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-years".
Contrary to the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight actions.
The police speaker: "The bete has apparently financed its media dependence". Only four times had the bomb exploded between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019 on the city street.
The resulting total damage is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomber is now in the research department. Police investigations are continuing against him.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent landscapes.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group strengthens its strategy for the Vienna airport. In the middle of the prize campaign with ticket flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the AAUA's daughter "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press speaker from the Austrian Airlines against the APA. "AvitionNetOnline" had previously reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Airport will be dissolved with de facto. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. This takes the AUA from January 2020 into "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Vienna’s routes to Germany will be taken from Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA-Treaty and network planning, the speaker said. Flight times should be agreed on connection flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna-Treaty-Treaty and to build the decentral transport out of the German countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the AUA Group West. In other words, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and air carriers are from Eurowings. Eurowings operating under AUA flight number will then no longer be reported on in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the Vienna airport, a premier race was launched after the Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be charged with 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish ticketer sends four Ryanair machines and Crews to Vienna, as well as in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticised the cooperation as an association for the collective contract.
The campaign by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda has been over the AUA for five years, rejected the AUA president Andreas Otto on Friday: "We remain the number one in place in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is permitted

Studies in the Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, malnutrition - there are risk factors for heart racing disorders. But what does a heart failure or a heart attack really do? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the legacy of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Over the analysis of the legacy of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of heart disease.
The research project was the largest in the German-speaking area, shared with the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppenddorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kitchen Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland, the University Hospital Davos is part of the Foundation and the University Hospital Zurich is involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy food are the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the combination between genes and external influences was not known enough. Now scientists want to compare the total benefit of 8,000 healthy people with the 1,000 patients at the UKE University Heart and Fever Center.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes known as possible disease-producing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - it was known from the clinic. Each year about 200 were added.
The goal of the five-year project is to follow up the initiatives to develop new options for the care, recognition and treatment of cardiac disorders, heart failure and heart failure. The data could also be useful in researching other public diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, director of the University of Heart and Phytosology. New knowledge of the combination between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer may also be possible.
The president of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm's desire to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has been dealing mainly with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Accuracy Medicine is to be established and a professor for bioinformatics is to be created. In order to support his commitment, the logistics operator living in Switzerland said that he had been operating in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The biotests of the healthy participants are from Hamburg, which are also associated with the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, the largest local health study in the world. At the inheritance key, scientists will look closely at the protection of anonymous data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) to data, says Holger Moch from the University Hospital in Zurich.
A person’s income can now be decided by UKE within 24 hours. The clean costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, which has been published in 2001, has still cost hundreds of millions of euros. The study will start on 1 October 2020 and will be analysed by the end of 2020. The first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Untreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 disabled boys from a Koran school. According to locals, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered those who reported part of a minor victim, as police spoke of Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them offered to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were arrested under the premise to be instructed in the Quran and "improved". Indeed, the guardians of their teachers were held under "the most honorable and unmanaged conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children under the age of nine, were arrested in a small room.
The Koran School has been following the information for about ten years. The residents had noticed repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They had nothing to do with the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Coran schools. They replace the often missing state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief work, therefore, over 40,000 people fly across the border in the neighbouring country of Niger over the past ten months.
Marked and persecuted: Nigeria Police release 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police released nearly 400 students from heartbreaking conditions. "Many of them were arrested and some had visible injuries that were due to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were found there on Thursday after a statement in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humane". The officers took the school director and six teachers after the liberation.
The children, all young people, were held in their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some of them were sexually abused. TV shows disabled and injured students in a vulnerable state of health.
World football choice: More products after Mass and Klopps Kür
Not valid "Significant"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe are excellent
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa draws the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and with that record.
After Nicaragua's Captain declared that he had never voted in favour of the World football election, he came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not even valued - with a curious reason.
Many of the Fifa's events have proved to be encouraging in recent years: the WM performance, the double plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa's global football election has not gone beyond the suspicion - if it is not clear from the fact that the national coaches and national associations of members often vote after sympathy because of objective assessment.
However, after having already complained to the captain of Nicaragua, he did not agree at all, and now there are further differences: Egypt regrets that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not fall into the formal and publicly acceptable voting review.
The Fifa admits that "the signatures on the electoral forms have been issued in large letters and therefore not valid" . It has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's Trainer is also surprised
There is also a complaint from the Sudan about the choice. While the situation in Egypt is fully monitorable, the Sudanese alliance states that Trainer Zdravko Lucarisic did not agree as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on one place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was just as effective, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese alliance.
Prefectures had also argued Captain Juan Barrera: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All of my votes are incorrect, thank you." In his case it was alleged that the Nicaraguan football band has simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the announcement was made: yes, but of course it was not intended. The complete wafer records were "irrgently" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the head of the Nicaraguan election, it was provided in a communication of the association. But actually, the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative errors", he said in the announcement. Both Rosas and the male trainer Henry Duarte had voted for the Messiah, "as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but stress that the election process was monitored outside by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains an unwarranted winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine-Affects: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken openly for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said U.S. government governor Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where it comes from here, it is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistblelower business before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the decision of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the enthusiasts. These showed that Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensskyj on a phone to investigate the activities of the democratic presidentate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have long held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistblelower victims, only a few have failed to recognize their disapproval. Scott's warnings are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already taken action against Trump's policy, such as the closure of environmental protection regulations and the violation of immigration rules.
As a senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right way and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go on the ground".
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States of America, have not formally discussed the procedure against the storm that will be decided at the Congress. Therefore, their warnings are particularly symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. In the case of Romney, who represented the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extended and thoroughly destructive".
In the introduction of an official procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives may have announced an investigation, and they propose to him the abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political uses.
There is no precise timetable for the official procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make such an effort. However, the decision about an actual service is not in the Senate where the majority are. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. Until then, no US President has been informed by an agency's impeachment procedure.
Were the folders on board of rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have been raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June, after she was arrested by the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board without permission at the port of Lampedusa. Following strong protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was resumed a few days after an Italian judge.
New serious allegations against rockets are now being made. In this way three men who may be alleged to have wandered into Libyan refugee camps with the "Sea-Watch 3" arrived in Italy. The suspects have been found in a recording shop in Messina (Sysilian) after migrants have reconnaissanced their painiers in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but we don't even have certain information about it," said "Sea Watch" speecher Ruben of the German Press Agency.
It was reported by the police in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, raped and even killed. It was handled by Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and both Egypt Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically chicanized and exploited by repeated and persistent physical violence," he said.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is on board the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without legs," said a new builder. Then it's one of the main reasons why people fly from Libya. It's therefore very likely that there are mothers on the ships too. "It's therefore very important that it's going to happen".
Former Italian Minister of Interior Matteo Salvini requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk acts for delivery records at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company the view of new record records strong performance on the bridge.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" sector blog.
The request was strong, so Tesla 110,000 orders could be booked, there was further written in Musks round writing. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong has not been the course for nearly four months. Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars in total. In the coming four-year period, there must be six-digit numbers. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but there are few gains. Despite the last loss of the tree.
US budget dispute: Renewing only a bridge financing
The new budget year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to finance the transition until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States is once more free of charge before the new fiscal year begins on 1 October. The Senate is following the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to finance a transition (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision on Wednesday, it would have been a shotdown, a joint closure of the federal administration. President Trump must still put the decision into effect.
Shutdown declined
In the meantime, the federal government is now funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year ending Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to meet the 12 rules of expenditure which can be allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the new budget year of 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives where they have the majority. However, they reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have no chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. On the other hand, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less, which are almost majority-compliant.
The spirits differ mainly in terms of resource allocation for the area of Inland security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats are violating the wall plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The fight on the wall has already been launched in December 2018 and has led to a 35-day shootdown.
At the wall building, the spirits are different
At present it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve issues in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding than on 21 November. Also, a shoutdown is not excluded.
On the basis of the continued inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve rules of expenditure, and thus the risk of a sudden fall in the threat of a shoutdown has been achieved to automate the process of popularity. Proposal S. 1877 for the prevention of Shutdowns would continue to finance the federal administration automatically at the level of the previous year, to link the travel activity of parliamentarians and to retain their pay until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fruit for Lesbens and Singles
In France, artificial fruit is also to be produced in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority for a government legislative proposal which allows all women to claim in vitro production. This would lead to a significant increase in demand for anonymous contributions.
The proposal still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right warehouse warned that many "children without a father" could grow in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new solution is the core component of a bioethics law, which, Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "chance" for society. It forms the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents are given. The cost of artificial fertility for all women should be borne by the social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from tot Ehemann further prohibits
With a small majority, the National Assembly has shown a change against this, which should give whites access to their dead man's sperm for artificial fertility. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, artificial fertility is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past there were cases in which women complained against the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The enemies of the presbyterian in Paris argued that such a bright child would carry a "specially severe fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and of the opposition's members had spoken against the artificial fruit of the deceased partner's sperm. They stressed that a white woman would suffer a "double pain" if her husband's death was not satisfied.
Initiators of the proposed amendment now consider it unfair that a white person can be born with the sperm of an unknown but not with their own partner in the future.
Until then, the artificial fertility in France is allowed only by heterosexual couples who cannot prove their children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Busin had already announced in the summer that the maternity leave is still prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is still often difficult.
Equivalent payments for the climate: Call for flight allowance for the Union will be below
There is a lot of flying at colleges. Therefore, the country will also be allowed to carry out a climate change in the future. The directors say they didn't have money for it. But now they're also under pressure.
Schools should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Streets
After the country-sector conference had responded positively to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a Pedagogical University for compensation for service flights are crying out. This is the first step "really necessary", while there must be a broad debate on the prevention of flights, it is called in their opinion.
Russia takes again North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB Secret Service, the catchees should have been caught illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been caught. At that time there was an exchange between border guards and ship crew. Three Russians and a North Koreans were injured, the fisherman later suffered serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high seas, where the coastal guard of Russia runs to their own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30 000 Tint fish caught
The re-checks revealed 30,000 inkfish on the boats and were seized. In addition, the data were taken after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued prison permits to the North Koreans this year on charges of domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested as media since then.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the coastal region of Primorje, Georgia Martynow, recently reported high ecological damages by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with artificial synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also keep small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be provided in the sea where they needed 200 years to be moved.
Future only 18,000: USA reduced asylum limits
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth lies against asylum seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal training of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, there will be a threat to believers and Iraqi asylum.
The US government is about to reduce the historically low limit for the recruitment of new refugees. In the year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum of 18,000 people will be admitted to the country, as stated by the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the recent year the limit is still around 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the reception preparation for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, there have been much higher reception limits.
The proposed overcrowding of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs still referred to the United States as the "best and most talented nation in history" as a formulation that reminds us of the use of the language of the US's influential presidents.
A "responsibility-sensitive approach" with refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them there, Trump stated. For his hard course in migration policy, he has many demands from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of conflict is the border to Mexico, which wants to withdraw the trumpet. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had tied to the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal political developments in the US capital, it is unclear.
The US Government wants to focus on the recruitment of two refugee groups in the future after a statement from the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk of this, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The United States wants to reach out to people from this "Northern Trieck" Central America in other Asyl countries. On this basis, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to accommodate the move to Mexico's southern border.
Court ordered release of Orange-Utan from Zoo to
An Orange-Utan-Wibechen has been transferred from the original zoo of Buenos Aires to a humane station in the United States. In 1986, "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo was promised the rights of a "non-human person", so its release was forced. The animal was transported on Thursday by direct flight to Dallas - but not as a passenger, but in the cargoroom, as Anwalt Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human waste are not able to adapt to life in the wild, they are going to live in the freeway of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more oranges and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pets by Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" has to spend about 40 days in the Seadwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. In 2014 the process of animal protection for "Sandras" has contributed to the conversion of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre will be established there for the acquisition of species.
Record for Switzerland Extremberg climber: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Dani Arnold Extremelberg climber has succeeded in a new household resort in the Italian Alps at almost 3000 meters high.
Without net, double ground or other means, the Swiss forces the 550 meters high in the North Wings in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute speed freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. So he subsisted the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder of Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European North Walls.
Nicke benefited from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, U.S. sports producer Nike has lost a significant profit plus. The net gain increased by 1.4 billion dollars (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, as the company reported on Tuesday. This is why the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which the Addidas competitor refers online to its customers.
In the three-month period until the end of August, sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars. The most powerful were the number of Nicke sales with a plus 22% in China. In this way, the Beaverton Group in the United States of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief of Finance Andy Champion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sport manufacturer and thus build up its competitive advantage. The investors are pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sport manufacturer increase by more than five per cent.
Long live stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football Prof. Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has bound a long-standing stadium ban against a fan. The champion Jesus from Brazil was arrested by the fan on Instagram. Jesus published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officeralas Roma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToracism.
The association responded on Thursday. He reported the account of the fan at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma hangar should never visit again a game of the association, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scan racist practices against black rivals. "We can't have racism in society or sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. We have to identify the responsible and run out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend.
The Italian authorities have now placed 38 ranked fans of the director of Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer attend the stadium for a period of ten years, the police shared with them. The others are therefore prohibited from four to seven years.
The fans are in contact with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fangroups in the area of Juventus. The 12 are called for, among other things, severe repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the findings with a display last year.
The Ultra-directors should close after Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They had "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fancurve and should have pressureed young people to get to more affordable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millions of people are narcissistic, generation Z is political - all year rounds are observed with graphic names. Look at this, the designations are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the daily feelings of young people?
"The Krabes are coming!" On 21 September, the cancer epidemic started at the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, where the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was announced by the Department for Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern carrier of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has an ideal ecological condition with a mix of "30 per cent mountains, 20 per cent water areas and 50 per cent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun have already started with cancer treatment. Over time, the cancer industry has developed into an excellent industry that has contributed to high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. Gaochun has been active in recent years for a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of cancer use and a technologically supported cancer treatment.
In recent years, Gaochun has launched a reform on "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and authorities" and has carefully established the service network for "acceptance under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a network of services, a platform for credit transfer". To this end, the city wants to optimise the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun creates the benefits given on site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Angui area and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an alternative to intelligent high-end production companies, biomedicine and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health industry and environmental industries leading to the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has contributed to the development of a national, all-wide tourist area and of foreign transport modes of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources for the urban areas are the main sources of tourism and tourism.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump vs.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN-voluntage meeting from a alleged offer by the United States to cancel sanctions. The United States had given an end to all sanctions on its official website for talks with the Tehran leadership.
President Donald Trump of the United States, however, spoke to the Iranian official about Twitter: "The Iranian wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting should be held. "And America says I have sanctions on," Ruhani added. The kind of punishment that should be put to end has been discussed. "And they have clearly said we have all sanctions on".
However, if this precedent was not carried out in an acceptable manner, Ruhani was criticised. No one can predict the outcome of negotiations in view of the current criminal measures and "the atmosphere of the maximum pressure imposed".
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. It was the hope of the Europeans to save nuclear agreements with Russia and China with Iran. This was to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - close to 200 floods
After the Western Turkey has been hit by two earthquakes within a short time, fear grows in the face of a disaster. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the baby died on the day before, there have been almost 200 floods, the Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday the earthquake of strength 5.8 had destroyed the Marmara region before Istanbul and eliminated panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, declared Octay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough for babies, says the Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the recent danger is being ignored. Every year, badly built homes are destroyed - among other things by the many smaller earthly bees that regularly spoil Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open areas which have been built in the center as refuge sites are long built. By the 20th anniversary of the Gölckük baby in August, the building room of Istanbul had warned that it estimated that one million buildings in Istanbul would not be Earthless.
The epicenter of the baby from Thursday was located in the marble front of the Silivri district and about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller afterbbebbe provided a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbuler Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu participated in Twitter with, injured or injured at first. The state-run TRT showed people who had panicked out of their homes. The students were brought to the Silivri district for safety reasons from the buildings. Some students refused to see pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly threatened by earthquakes. Under the Marmarame, there is a section of the so-called northern Atlantic disturbance marking the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolytic Earth. Turkey is once again threatened by earthquakes. One of the most lethal was the baby in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people came to life.
Researchers feared that an earthquake of strength would strike 7.1 to 7.4. However, when it reached the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday the earthquake struck again the West of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-bags fully packed with all the necessary ones in addition to home controls, and schools bring children to see how they should react when the earth wakes up. When the next big baby comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbuler Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom). Following these comments, two Minarettes of Moshes entered the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning about breast-feeding in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings woke up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more intense than the day of duty, a user writes. The chief of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Clinic, warned of future disasters via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the baby is given according to the official information at 13.59 (Ordertime). Just a few minutes after the first baby, CNN Turkey said a baby was given with a strength of 4.0 on the head scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 struck the Turkish marble region - it was to be sprayed up to Istanbul. Also, its epicenter located in the Marmarameer west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Abad shared with it on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for strike lines on this day of service: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers point out that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it is sometimes caused by damage - and massive damage.
The Earth Beef Sikrü Ersoy calculates that the Earth bee is now a warning. It is more likely that this will make it possible to say to CNN Turkey. "This could be the signs of a larger earth bee," said Ersoy to the sender. "In the past or later the big bee will come too".
A few weeks ago, there had been an accident - the baby solved major concerns in Istanbul. In Albania it also had a severe earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injuries.
Parliament: New Offences in Ukraine-Affère
Two broken documents provide for a new substance in Ukraine's case for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible process of administration, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaints made by an anonymous indicator about Trump and its controversial telephone with the Ukrainian presidents are important points of concern for statements against the Presidents. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". In addition, he doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Flight from United Airlines to Toilet closed - Air Force Retention
Since a passenger was stopped in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was redirected. The WC-Port was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline shared US media.
At an out-of-the-counter crossing in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the five cabins. After about an hour she had been arrested, US media wrote to other passengers. To continue the flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video released on the Internet, which is supposed to come from the US-media of flight 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it.
The Kackerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unknown.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous "The Conversion" story, British Successor Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The Roman "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear on 27 November in German, shared the Diogenes Verlag (Zyrich). It is about the conversion of a man named Jim Sams, who was ignored or raped in his previous life, but now he is one of the most powerful men in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will in action and is determined to leave nothing and nobody else.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be forced out at a critical moment when ministers lie like the Soviet leaders lie without shame, when Brexitiers in high positions just to reliev the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask what he can do. There's only one answer to it: write it." By McEwan, it was only early in the year of the novel "machines like me" on artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 is the first story to be published by Gregor Samsa, who looks forward to the morning and sees himself "turning into an unhindered reader", after and after family and society are excluded and finally goes on. "Ian McEwan is happy to describe Kafka to describe a world where the head stands," said the Diogenes.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fluster brakes to reduce noise pollution by good trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electricalized.
This should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions according to the EU authority. The funds come from the EU's "Connecting Europe Facility" website.
Thomas Cook: All travel until 31 October
German Traveller Thomas Cook said one day after his application for insolvency, all travel until 31 October 2019, including 31 October 2019. Travelers could "not be represented for reasons of insolvency", the company shared on Thursday evening.
These include bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. As it is about to start on 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, it will be examined in advance.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was brought to trial at the Court of Justice of the British Mothers' Group and filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Booker Travel, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurance wants to transfer hotels from now on
However, since this Friday hotels in the country that are currently hosting Thomas Cook holiday, money should be received from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are according to Zurich to the condition that vacationers are no longer required for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without providing detailed calculations, the hotels in the holiday sites should now receive 50% of outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels will not be invited or used for individual payment of hotel bills from now on," said the speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on their own terms. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Union (DRV) and the Federal Consumer Centres had criticised this.
As many hotels are concerned, it will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance speaker. According to the Thursday, another 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschallauler from Germany was on the way. Zurich Germany has secured Thomas-Cook customer's leave and return.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the currently announced payments to hotels through the Zurich insurance only help passengers who are still on their way. Thomas Cook customers who want to fly only on vacation look bad. Later Thursday evening the company shared all the trips until 31 October. This also applies to such bookings as are already paid.
As is the case with initial travel since 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, further advance checks will be carried out. In principle the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance policy which can be represented by the Kaera company. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibility of refunding the travel price and apply their claims on a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Springmine in Angola
Prince Harry has been leading Lady Diana's commitment for a long time. In Africa he is now walking directly on his mother's trails.
With a blue splitter shield shielded the British Prince Harry in Angola has healed and destroyed a bomb.
Near a campus of the British Hallo Trust, at the place Dirico, he set up his front door on the morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the bombers exploded in the village of Savannah. Although alone the Hallo Trust destroyed more than 100,000 remains of the decade-old bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly into the city of Huambo on the trails of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same springmaster who first accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the way she went. The images on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a vast mining field were going around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Hallo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa which has started in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Current Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he will not be guaranteed a third break of Brexit negotiations with him, but what statements in the polarising British are already eternal. The latest court ruling in the United Kingdom will shift as a dhamocle lock over the blond ship. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the start of this week was cancelled.
Boris Johnson still holds Deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go beyond Johnson. During his visit to a hospital, he expressed his support for an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful that it's going to work.
The time is running out for Brexit dealers in Brussels. For about six weeks the EU and the British trader have time to prevent an Austrian Great Britain from entering the European Union without an agreement. However, the latest talks have not yet reached a break. An agreement will appear more difficult by the end of October. At the start of the British Prime Minister's law, there is no recast of the Austrian date. However, the opposition does not break the Prime Minister's words.
US Authority: Other deaths by e-Zigaretten
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, between 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this regard, the US Health Authority shared CDC. A study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" has already confirmed more than 900 cases, some 500 of which have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unclear. In Europe no similar increase of lung damage has been reported. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt
Millions of videos have been shared in online networks. The producer and actor living in Spain is calling for a "popular revolution". For today's freeday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who are critical of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to have mass customers with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities have already been alarmed. In the center of Cairo there has been an increased presence of police. Several U-road stations have been closed and roads around the central Tahrir Square have been closed. In recent days the police had reinforced their road controls and the telephones of pedestrians have been partially checked on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20 September the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last week in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura came to protest with hundreds of participants. One such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people were arrested last week. Many of them were arrested voluntarily - only because they were "at the wrong time at the wrong place", they shared HRW under the charge of law enforcement.
The organization also criticised the census in the North African country. The government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to link further protests against al-Sisi. Since 2013, the government has ruled the country since 2013, after he had been terrorized by the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and sentenced in part over the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs von Grönland-Expedition Back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at the port of Hamburg, among other things by shipr Boris Herrmann, the climateist Greta Thunberg with the "Malizia" race on the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the effects of earthquake on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Iceland and Greenland over the past months.
The Fridays for Future Movement was a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to report for word. For decades, people knew that the earth was warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if it were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under the exception of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the melting of the sea. During the expedition, it was measured, among other things, by a thin Greenlandic glacier and was caught with nets for microplastic purposes.
For his "fight on sustainable and respectful use of the world sea," the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadvcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who survive the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award. "There is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades".
Treasure spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for Nudeln 430 euros
430 Euros for two Tellers Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: It seems to be too many Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 Euros of wine money paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered current reactions.
"These cases are damaging to Rome's view. We call on the police to ask whether it is a fraud here," asked a speaker from Federagit, who called for the association of the travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggere (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the restaurant's owner. The Japanese had not only Spaghetti but also ordered fresh fish, but the local owner had been justified. However, this is not to be taken from the account. Also, a drink of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, meaning the guest price.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is captivating? US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with an official procedure after the disturbing developments of the past few days, which the Democrats would like to check with their research in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone is generally with Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selenskyj. The opposition of the Whiteman, who spoke out of concern about national security and the democracy of the United States with his complaint to the public, is a monster: the President has lost the power of his office to instrumentise the government of another country's influence on the 2020 election. He has been using Ukraine's dependence on it and wants it to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the written signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not repeat the complete statement. The telephone from July 25, however, is just an episode of a much larger story, which stands in the centre of its own personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the public's point of view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reported travel plans in Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows himself very well that his intentions are wrong. "We don't agree on a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation which we have the right to do," he says. One can think it is inappropriate, but "it's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants that there is a basis for such information in Ukraine - "because this information can be very helpful to my clients and as a help to my government".
The lawyer and former mayor of New York appear to have been infected with the right anti-candidatin fantasy, which is fixed on Trumps vs.candidatin at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conceived with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time to build an opportunity for Russia's media in the United States. However, this project was never serious.
This is exactly what is being said about the trumpet in July on the phone with Selenskyj. Giulianis and the president's version says: the former Vice-President and now a prominent candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have been pressured by the Ukrainian government to release the then Ukrainian general government, Viktor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for his son Hunter's request.
In fact, the run was something else. When Joe Biden asked that the Ukrainian general government should go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected by them. Also, Schokin was accused of even more corrupt causes, the U.S. government was not the only Western partner who insisted on his release.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, in particular Germany, Britain and Spain. On the site allergen.de users report that Facebook has not been invited again since about 15.30 a.m.. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if it is not yet on the same scale.
Instagram and Co.
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also took this time back to Twitter to make their air fresh.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean aircraft from the Antarctica ice. They were on their way by a boat and several miles away from their base than their engine had failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the landing.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 p.m. we received the message that we were started about ten minutes ago, and we were in good 20 minutes late over the boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Artowski Polish Antarctica Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been returned to their research station.
Warning: smartphone NIE wireless download
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used yet.
As recently as several new smartphones have arrived on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call again a study from the beginning of July. The wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperatures at which to push
Researchers warn against the wireless charge of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick, i.e. extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, it is the much larger heat development. If you call a normal phone per cable, the battery will rise within three hours to 27 degrees. On wireless charging the researchers have always measured themselves in the perfect direction of the smartphone on the chargepad. The phone is slightly above the threshold, and the temperature is even higher. Furthermore, the water pressure of the chargepad, which increases the power consumption again.
Capacity and time of life
According to researchers, the temperature for Akkus' sustainability is a decisive factor. There each grade plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery was not only driven by capacity, but also did not last so long. Life is thus less. The researchers therefore suggest that the smartphone is always charged by cable. Since an aquarium is always connected with high costs for modern smartphones, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally raised the costs for an aquarium - and even for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely comfortable: Just put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now even already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be loaded without a free cable salate and a soft stopper. Since Qi (is a global standard for inductive energy transmission) is implemented by an exceptional apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stuo photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has increased according to its own data within just six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the peak of Manaslu in Nepal and has set up a record to share with its expedition organizers.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international strikes: from him a photo of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest Schlange in the morning.
The image of the mass-and-and-rang led to a debate on more security measures at the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, 11 climbers died during the siege within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the destruction of the 14th millennium: Chinese authorities are currently closing the Xixabanma mountain in Tibet. For that reason it is called among other bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to speak with China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a heavy elephant who shared a police conversation on Friday. "We suspected that the elephants had been poisoned".
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists to Sigiria. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, and an autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The dead are often farmers whose animals were considered harmless in their country. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This is most true when animals move around their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. At their execution theorizes the death penalty.
Stable British Oil Tanks Leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. This gave the seafarer Bandar Abbas known as the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanks flying under British flag on 19 July under the pretext of violating the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Underhaust House will want to examine the board of traveling officials, Thomas Cook. It is about the board's maintenance packages as well as the question why the British Government could not financially support the surviving companies. "Our interest is in the company as well as in the control of external accounting officers," said the Committee President Rachel Reeves in London. "It is obvious that we have to do this with a bad example of management".
According to experts, genes are estimated at the risk of dynaecrrhosis
The role of the gene in family growth risk has been clearly overestimated. To this end researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to be more difficult than ever. This has had consequences for calculating the individual risk of breast cancer, stressing the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk reads Tesla Actions Up
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" sector blog on Thursday. The demand was strong so that Tesla could cover 110'000 orders, which is still in Mussk round writing.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer. Tesla has to provide as many resources as possible to the quarterend.
Customers failed the information: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong has not been the course for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 will total 360'000 to 400'000 cars. In the coming four-year period, there will be six-digit numbers. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 has been asked, but there are few gains. Despite the last loss of the tree.
Will the British Government enforce Brexit law? Johnson repeats
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned whether he is looking for an unregulated brexit on the basis of the possibilities of an environment of law adopted by Parliament. On a relevant issue, he simply told journalists on Friday that his Government would be in force.
The law provides that the government should apply for an extension of the Austrian term, should not have reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had voiced his suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political skis" to enforce the law. Johnson could use a procedure line that would move the law to the time after the EU Austria.
Johnson said he was looking for a deal with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran is clearly leading high urination
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on European Contracting Parties in the conflict on the salvation of the historic nuclear agreement. "I regret the inability or lack of readiness of European states to take concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the end of the UN-Fall Conference in New York. In order to avoid their commitments, he considered "more steps" than the agreements of the 2015 agreement.
The conflict is behind the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in turn, includes the commitment to normalise the economic relations of Tehran. The United States, in 2018, has come out of the Allegation of the Agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a course change in its aggressively-considered neighbourhood policy. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to issue a new agreement with more severe charges and in the meantime reacts to severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded to a re-examination of the Iranians restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared for use with Uran in early September. Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 other Uraniums.
Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to carry their share of the deal and therefore left Iran with the cost and burden of pressing US sands alone, Rohani would have to be alone. Nevertheless, further talks will be given that would hopefully lead to a solution.
Rohani continues to fight Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the municipality changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels in Yemen had known what the United States had been accused of as false. "We have nothing to do with this," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must provide evidence for it," said Rohani. This had not been possible for the European leaders in their discussions with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they had only claimed that the rebellions in Yemen could not take place as they did. Rohani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before any discussion with US President Trump, Rohani asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and wisdom".
Come from other stars cross-sectional solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the world. This was only the first time. The comet can turn back to other solar systems.
What was at first just one argument is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of the world was baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
The next comet was discovered on August 30 at the Margo Observatory by Amateurastronome Gennadi Borissow on the Crime - with a self-constructed telescope of 65 centimetres across the border. Observations from various observers confirmed not only that it is a unknown comet, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object seen after 1I/'Oumumaa of 2017, which was seen on a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights from a foreign solar system before it disappears on the German side. First observations show that the interstellar comet that resembles our own system, as reported by the Canadian Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is located in this distance significantly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority Nasa in a report.
The comet is following the analysis of a so-called hyperbelway that brings it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin as reported by the International Astronomy Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and classification of celestial bodies. To honour its discoverers, the interstellar superstellar stars, first led under Catalogue C/2019 Q4, are named 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: contrary to 1I/'Oumumaa, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in flight. So researchers remain for months for research. "The object will reach the highest brightness by mid-December and will still be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be observed by October 2020 with even greater professional telescopes".
Several observers have already taken the visitor into visit. Thus a team of Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuaa, in a first survey of the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. The recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a significant shift of the comet.
Researchers and researchers of the Canadian Astrophysicical Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweat stars, which offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and it shows that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems by similar processes as in ours, complemented by the Leóns College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years after the IAU's assessment indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such visitors are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly start a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency will be stationed at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth by the three-year-old "Comet Interceptor" (Germanly about comets) and will run either on an unprecedented, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumumaa.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is this way: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the capital of China, a first passenger machine of the Chinese United Airlines was landed, a special honor for the capitals and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers should be completed annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it should be already 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-tourage project. China's most recent loan project is also called "seasters" because of its six-star building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new U-road transports passengers in just 20 minutes to Beijing’s inner city.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had been able to learn from Beijing several times. The opening of the building since 2006 - and significantly smaller - of the main city airport in Germany has been moved again and again. In Beijing, however, after four years, a first passenger machine has been established.
New trans-shipment aircraft is to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British Space Agency dreams of the UK Space Agency. These, for the 2030s, will make it possible for a special operation (Synergetic Air-breaking Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company develops from Oxfordshire, quoted the US agent CNN as saying. "This is the technology that could definitely be processed," said Agent Graham Turnock to the sender. "We are talking about the 2030s, and the work has progressed very much."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate with the Australian army. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole takes about 20 hours. Until then, as the only trans-shipment aircraft for passenger transport had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and it took three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Paris airport of Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 incidents of life occurred. Last year the US-American aircraft builder of Lockheed Martin Plane, together with a tour of the US fleet, has been known for a "flying plan".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point to point-transport," writes Reaction Enginees, among other things on its home page. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys at a speed of March 5 - which means five times as fast as the shell. In addition, such aircraft are also usable outside the earth's atmosphere and enable the "first generation of reusable framecraft".
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tips in Ukraine deals
In Ukraine's bid for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump wants to explore possible outstanding places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistbleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before employees of the United States Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such a "a little different" happened in the past as today.
This was considered to be a tipping attempt against tippingpers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media distributed audio media on Friday. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official procedure against Trump. Their motions were based primarily on the written complaints of an anonymous secret worker, the severe charges against Trump and its government centre. On a large public press, pictures of the indicator were made public on Thursday.
As part of its work, the Whistbleblower wants more government employees to have information on why the US President "uses his authority" to achieve another country's interests in the US 2020 election.
At the center of the prefecture there is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj Ende July, in which the trumpet encouraged his colleagues to investigate what might damage his political rival Joe Biden. In this regard, Biden's son Hunter's former business in Ukraine and his alleged efforts to protect his Springling from Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower accused the White House of looking at the Ukrainian telephone as well as the translation: leading government staff had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic word-luut protocol was prepared. This was after the conversation with lawyers from the White House but was removed from a database normally provided for and kept in a specially protected system. Until then, only a major dialogue protocol was published.
The identity of the indicator is not public. The "New York Times" reported that it should be a member of the CIA Foreign Secret Service.
Trump again asked the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that "the so-called Whistbleblower" had spread information out of second hand which had appeared inappropriately.
In New York, though, the President of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted in anger and accused, Trump's statement undertook once more the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives there have been several investigations against Trump and its environment in various committees for several months. In view of Ukraine's proponents, the Democrats are now moving forward with renewed emphasis towards establishing a possible procedure against Trump.
"The Whistbleblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the representative's house, Adam Ship.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and non-political area, who were mostly under democratic, but also under republican presidents, were following a statement published on Friday following the investigation by the Democrats for a possible procedure.
For the next procedure, there is no precise timetable. With the majority of them in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeccation procedure. The decision about an actual official service is not in the Senate where the majority are. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. Until then, no US President has been informed by an impeccement procedure of the Office.
VW Business Council: Workplaces are "dangerous"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be carried out in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer's business council. The brand will reduce its annual manufacturing costs from 10 billion euros to two billion euros by 2023.
A key to this is staff costs. The 2016 "In future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Business Council is already planning to build 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. Basically, a job can only be built on the car manufacturer if it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance will apply until 2029.
However, as our paper now comes from business circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are "degrading" across another route - so the official course would not be repeated.
The Board of Directors has no option in these cases to force the re-employment. However, there is a lack of staff in many places to take up employment coverage to increase the concerns before a general explosion of vehicles. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn again and again from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said: "A social adjustment of the employment volume is being made as agreed in terms of the demographic curve".
The brand VW wants to standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. It should also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and competitiveness. Production President Andreas Tostmann said at a conference of managers in Berlin: "We are well advised to make a crisis party".
In this way, there is already success: For example, since 2013, production costs for each vehicle would be down by comparison to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the golf 8, which will be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory to produce in the vehicle. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter are finished components. For Wolfsburg VW interiors, it is necessary to build 800,000 cars per year, so that the work is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, only about 700,000 vehicles were loaded in Wolfsburg - provided by the reduced diesel demand and the problems of conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust test.
As President Tostmann has already announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg a million cars are "perspective" from the band. This will make it possible to link the golf production in the family work - because the work Zwickau by turning the equipment to the location for e-autoproduction.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently been back on track. Therefore, the expectations now remain on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it is expected to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers.
Forceed with Voodoo to Prostitution: Human Dealers Condemned
Young women from Nigeria are forced into slavery and forced into prostitution. Six forced human traffickers must be in prison for this.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday to detention and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had locked young women from Nigeria into the riot zone and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the visiting Nigerians still had to have a ritual voice in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were transported by Libyan lockers across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on different boards to work out the expected lockers costs of an average of EUR 25,000.
The defendants - four men and two women - had given the conclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians into the process on board. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult," said Justice Isabel Hoffmann at the trial. "Some were rightly opposed."
The courts are based on the business and bonded involvement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, slavery and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo requires negotiations with Airthansa
FIM Sustainable conflict with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the flight cooperation Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the company will " inform the LH Group on 14 October", Ufo tariff president Daniel Florer shared with him on Friday. Airthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been leaving it for months to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened by a decision of the Court of Labour of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff contracts were not announced. The court showed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and sought to make a decision against it. "That a second court sees the matter quite different, I think unlikely," said Ufo-Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the National Labour Court of Frankfurt for a legal review of the status of Ufo as a cooperative. The company argued that the company had not used a representative board for months and therefore could not fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, there was a strong leadership conflict in the departmental trade, during which several members of the board and the board, including longtime trade chief Nicolele Baublies, had already voted against the cabinet staff at Eurowings Ende July because of their doubts.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new Visa System
So far Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now going to change. The country wants to introduce new visa provisions on the Persian Gulf.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more future international tourists. By 2030, international and domestic visitors are expected to increase to 100 million per year, the tourism commission shared with them.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visitors usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the western state. With the new rules, the conservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own view, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkhaik and the oil field Curais. Consequently, the national oil production was drastic, the oil prices dropped to the height. It had to last several weeks until the Kingdom's oil production again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model was posted on Thursday (on the other hand) in her Instagram stories several party photos on which they are to see in the white wedding view. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a Juneline decision in Los Angeles following the popular magazine.
Justin posted several binders, including Banana prints on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smile for the wedding." Media reports indicate that the promi couple want to marry church the following week.
The beebers gave their word in a New York State office a year ago. A larger party had not given it at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two after initial problems had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't make a relationship".
Two deaths at air traffic control in Chechnya
Two people came to life at the time of the destruction of a small plane in western Chechnya. The Wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area at the city of Mecin (Metschin). At the time of death, there was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities have been looking for the machine since Thursday afternoon after the use of GPS. In the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The accident has to be identified. It is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers north of Regensburg.
Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to the damages, diseases, regional-based species, non-sustainable timber strike and the growth of the cities caused threats, the IUCN World Nature Protection Council reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them are not on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are at risk. 66 hours have already been at the highest level of risk and therefore before death.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangerous", "dangerously threatened", "dangerously threatened by extinction" and "dead in nature" to "dead". It lists more than 28,000 species worldwide as endangered.
Eberish and wild Russia threatened
In Germany there were particularly threats to Ebereschen (Sorbus), one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are so small or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary Russians. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017 at two levels of IUCN scale. The greatest threat is the Balkan mini-mute. Since the 1980s, it has spread across the whole continent and has almost natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and allies.
Strawcharts and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for wet animals, streams and moose. More than a fifth of the wet animals and moose and almost half of all species of wetlands are threatened, such as the IUCN. This is mainly at the destruction of the wild, in interconnected species, agricultural practices and climate change. Wet animals such as honey played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bass, the IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and give priority to the protection of these species."
Earthquakes in front of Istanbul: 34 Last reported
In the most recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. Death was not reported. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the baby was born on the day before, there have been almost 200 afterbirths. On Thursday the earthquake of strength 5.8 had destroyed the marble region in front of Istanbul and eliminated panic in the million metropolis.
The Government is now going to use a Commission to prepare the country for a better future on earth, announced in October. During the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for babies, says Mr Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be a particularly threat to the earth. Under the Marmaramer there is a section of the so-called northern Atlantic disturbance marking the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic plates.
One of the most difficult babies was one of the strong 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölkük southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people came back to life.
On Tuesday a storm of strength 4.6 had swept the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (Jlo) and Shakira are on half-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will take part in the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. That gave the singer a reputation on Twitter. "It won't be bigger", Shakira wrote to a photo by himself and Lopez. She was delighted to stand at the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be as far as Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been able to attend the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying in the middle of the show. "It is even more special now because the NFL 100 years are in place and I will perform with another Latina." You can hardly expect "to show what we girls can do on the world's largest stage".
Shakira showed in a statement that she was proud to stand beside another artist at one of the largest levels of the world and to represent Latines and Latins from the United States and the whole world. "And then even on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were together on a stage.
Shakara comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, and her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against low-sighted viewers
The Super Bowl is the high point of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you've lost your watch numbers last February, the show in the United States has been attracting the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people in the middle.
About the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, it was in front of the show: In the battle with the quarterback Colin Kaapernick wanted to not appear on topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B. Finally, the pop group Maoron 5 conducted half-time show - the critics were less friendly.
Kaapernick, then a quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was in the game in 2016/17 before NFL games in the National Hymne from protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaapernic released a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African football stars. Kaaapernick himself has been out of line since March 2017 and has no longer fought an NFL party. He proposes not to arrest him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks may be pleased to receive a press report from the travel provider Thomas Cook. There are high discounts on outstanding loans and loans. These include the Credit Suisse, the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, or the Swiss Credit must have made a total of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books.
The creditors of loans had to buy from 900 million to 1 billion dollars and the creditors from 550 to 825 million dollars. In fact, the amounts to be booked should be higher at the top of the bands, one expert said to the sheet.
How much the loss of believers at the end will be shown after the execution of the insolvency procedure. A process near this person does not promise too much hope. For example, some 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad conditions. Most money may be lost with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it was still worth it.
Rockete is supposed to have brought forced killers to Italy.
The Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought to Italy men who were supposed to have tortured and tortured in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have any secure information," said the speaker of the Seawatch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognizable the three men in Italy. They are supposed to have been raped, tortured and killed in Libya. The forced mothers were arrested in the receptionist's Italian Messina. Newfounders stressed that refugee organizations could not check who they were on their ships. "They come without legs".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, where a ship of the Italian financial police was closed. On that day the three suspects were also to be there.
U.S. Federal Government Warning for Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network network administrator Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high," Pai said to the "handling sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which each company has an obligation "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continues. This makes it very difficult to trust the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has agreed to request a "confidential declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, such as technical solutions, the "trade sheet" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not exist only from the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "where possible, would be able to check every single update in real time to raise security risks", says the FCC chief.
The Chinese Group Huawei makes close contacts with the Chinese state board:
The ownership ratio is odd. The company's company which is said to belong to the company is not unconditionally independent of the government," said Pai to the trade sheet.
The U.S. reports indicate where government employees are located within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to acquire the position of the US.
Chemistry plant burning in North France: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall lights the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been destroyed after hours - the space works could last for days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's clubs were closed in the region.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not be open on Friday carefully, sharing with the competent prefecture. The Ministry of the Interior had urged the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to quit smoking. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside to protect their feed and to first establish their nests.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the removal of noise, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmes were used in the fire department.
The chemical industry had previously raised a giant black smoke salt. French media reported massive flames and explosions in the company Lubrizol, which produces additional oil. The production facility is a few kilometers away from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to authorities in the so-called Siveso category of hazardous sites that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The president of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the reporter BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in trials at first. A pollution of the nearby areas could not be excluded but could not be excluded. In the river its towns were built against pollution, the Prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02.40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear for the first time. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies between Paris and the port city Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and so far"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest and what's better now," Le Maire said on Thursday evening when he presented the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the eurozone is weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates to make the necessary decisions."
Those countries that had budget spaces for more investment had to act, said Le Maaire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these toys, the Minister added and referred to his country's high government debt. This is more than 98 per cent of gross domestic product. The French state debt must be "stabilised" and "dedicated", said Le Maaire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to invest more and more in order to live in the European economy.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides tax reliefs of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is therefore responding, inter alia, to the protests of the wave wave movement. The debt should fall by 2.2 per cent, according to expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to pull?: Johnson weighs question about Brexit tactics out
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
The Parliament is back with a law before the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit. Critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a sleep fleet. On this opportunity, however, the Tory politician is tired.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the last law that Parliament has decided to take, what should prevent it from doing so.
The law provides that the government should apply for a change in the time limit, that no agreement should be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had voiced his suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political skis" to implement the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure line that would move the law to the time after EU Austria. Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's Chief Governor Dominic Cummings stated that he felt the political austerity of Brexit as a "stepping in the park" and was confident that the desired EU-US Austria would still be able to say: "We enjoy what we will win, we (e.g. Red: from the EU) will be expelled, no worries," said the British newspaper 'Telegraph' following a book presentation.
Cumblings, which led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the main strategy at the British government seat Downing Street. He is going to close behind the uncompromising policy that led the primer into a tragic situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the most large rock photos. But it must not always be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tashes) is deeply rooted in the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death from 1969 to 1998, was apparently proud and proud when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flimsy view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the power of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the immediate magic of the polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona before she found it for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids made it, hundreds of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
There are portraits, lifestyles, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his speech. And of course she still stands another in the middle: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephones in the bathroom with a cloth on his head or carries unfurnished moonboats. Certainly, McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but it was not always a normal life on their farm in South England or Scotland. Thus Mary McCartney said BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had beaten out of old potatoes. And it is not always been in the McCartneys.
Like almost another medium, the polaroid camera is starting at the right moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are probably a kind of family diary, but they are much more than clean quicksands.
It's about the key click: You have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it right at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda had the gift, always at the right time. "She knew it was simple," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a continuous picture book for Beatles fans, but also an aesthetic pleasure for all anecdotics, where landscapes have already been acting like abstract images. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared just 50 years ago.
"We'll buy more oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to import further oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the United States sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN plenary assembly.
However, Erdogan said that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian oil, since some companies had "retrieved for the US threats".
However, Turkey will "particularly continue our relations with Iran on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its entry out of the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran has secretly pursued an nuclear programme and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the use of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. Government wants to restrict the recruitment of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the recruitment of refugees. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a reunification programme would be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees from now on. That is a quarter of 40%.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to the support of refugees. However, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
The US Government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
With the programme set up in 1980, refugees from UN camps are selected throughout the world and settled in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a deep value. As former US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, who lost the white house, was almost 85,000.
Help organizations have recently responded to the announced decline of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would further damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects for its own information for the next financial year 350,000 asylum applications. These numbers are different from the New Zealand programme.
Donald Trump - "A Spitzel Comes Near"
U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt with indicators in the Whistleblower's supply of spyage. Anyone who has always been aware that he has used power abuse has "come close," said Trump according to a list of a private event on Thursday in New York. Several US media reports agree.
That's why Trump spoke to colleagues of the United States mission. When asked about the person who informed the whitebbleblower about events in the White House, he replied, "It's coming close." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were slaves? Right. The spy and the traitor, we tried to do something different than we are doing now."
Observers took note of a possible reaction to the death penalty. The Democrats used harsh criticism of Trump's warnings and threatened to arrest him. It was also intended to prevent a Congress investigation into a possible procedure against him, the presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Oversight in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower calls on the President in a now published complaint that his office does not need to offer a mixture of another country in the US-election 2020. In particular, it is about his controversial phone phone with his Ukrainian official colleague Woodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump placed him close to launching investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who is the Whistbleblower himself and its informants. As New York Times reports, however, it should be an analyst at the Whistbleblower of the CIA's Foreign Secret Service.
Flight boat identified: Baby and baby drinking in ägeis
Once again people are trying to get through the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. On a regular basis, there are often too many small boats. Now seven migrants have come to live - among them five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants came to life on the island of Chios. Among the victims were a baby as well as four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be rescued from the flow of possession of a previous train.
Among the victims was also to be a locker, reports the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were breaking up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the north of Chios Island. Innousses lies between Chios and the Turkish fortress.
Since then, hundreds of migrants from Turkey have moved to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly to small boats. A year ago, 174 people were on this route following the United Nations refugee aid work (UNHCR).
The Who broke the concert from
A U.S. rock band The Who has found a warm end because of a lack of independence by Ledsanger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show in Houston, he forgot his voice. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should let it go as long as it goes".
Leader guitarist Pete Townsend asked for forgiveness and added that Daltrey could "not really speak now". He promised to the audience to come to a rehabilitate concert at his cost.
For Fridays in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who said they should be followed at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Towsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental immediately set: WeWork leaves real estate markets
In New York WeWork has been raised to the largest office.
Within a few years WeWork will rise from the small start to the driving force on the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Renters must fear for billions of revenues.
The crisis of the WeWork office requires the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had a few days ago appointed founder Adam Neumann as head, moved the planned drilling process and started with the sale of subsidiary companies and values such as the private driving force to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. WeWork reported, among other things, the end of new offers with immediate effect.
WeWork rents large office spaces for a long time and rents them in part of small units to members. This can be individual freelance providers, small startups or all departments of large companies. Until then, WeWork is fueled by this business at an alarming rate. In the past year, the company has incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, at a cost of $1.8 billion. In this year alone the rental costs should be increased by increasing the cost of renting at an estimated $2.5 billion. To reduce the loss, the new company’s implementation will now have to have a new effect.
As a result, WeWork has concluded between contracts with periods of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for all real estate markets.
Countings of the economy Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, hired WeWork in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the last 24 months nearly 300,000 square metres of office space. Only WeWorks made new contracts to ensure that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the new areas that came to the market at this time. Without WeWorks expansion the office would have increased in the US Metropole at this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insider". Similarly, it appears in London where WeWork works among thousands of office locations in the best position.
In the British capital, the balance could also be lost on the real estate market without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a year ago by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros purchased office houses in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many tenants have built their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork is designed to make its business model profitable soon, so that the owners of the property must write down part of the expected billions of revenues. Access to the - without clicking - WeWork reservations have not been granted despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by any extra-founded subsidiary, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only has within certain limits.
Russia again caught a number of North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has been again against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, 262 other wilders who had been illegally caught in the waters were arrested after Friday by the Russian Inland Secret Service FSB of the Interfax Agency.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Before the border guards were attacked and three of them were injured. This time no injuries were given. The Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high-speed waters. The coastal guard of Russia carried their own data to protect their marine resources patrols. The re-checks had 30,000 tinted fish. In addition, three fishing and two motorboats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjett at Wladiwostok. The agency established the coast guard guard 2018 as a total of more than 8,000 damages.
The Russian fishing authority had also not issued prison permits to the North Koreans following complaints from domestic operators. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested as media since 2019.
The head of the Russian association of fishing companies in the coastal region of Primorje, Georgia Martynow, recently reported high ecological damages by North Korean fishermen. They were also bound by artificial synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also keep small living creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the networks would simply be kept in the sea where they needed 200 years to be moved. The ships themselves did not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured after the arrests last week. A wounded North Korean FSB also died after his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean ship and then a second after it opened fire.
U.S. travel ban against ex-President Castro
The United States has been against former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's travel bans. The US Foreign Ministry founded a statement on Thursday with Castro's participation in "severe human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is offering a system that would voluntarily take place in thousands of Cubans and give more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations there, with the support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. "The abuse of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump had spoken on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months there has been a strong struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has committed a whole series of sanctions against Maduros Government to force him into the knife and to help the opposition leader and independent interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is one of the most closely connected Maduros. The socialist Caribbean branch receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of foreign doctors. After the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret officials to Venezuela to assist the government in the oppression of government opponents.
New climate protest from Friday for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people again want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement Fridays for Future is planning to relocate to thousands of countries around the world. The start was due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests over Europe to North America. There, climateist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major competition in the Canadian Montreal. Before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How much the world demand will be on this Friday after the record participation of the week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was a good thing. "Last Friday over four million people have crossed the climate. We will do it again this Friday!" she wrote on Twitter. Up until the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries were completed.
In particular in Germany, the past Friday was very large. A good third of all the world's demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time a list of the movements followed by customer donations was planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jechen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Western-West countries, people want to go to the streets.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on its country's politicians to make a stronger use of climate protection. Within a short time, the Fridays for Future movement was created. In particular, students and students participated in climate protests, but also in increasing numbers of scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for greater respect for policy in the fight against earthquakes and the impending climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be taken under 1.5 degrees in comparison with pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had recently arrived at a two-week Transatlantic Tower with a high-sea coast in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she held an emotional talk at the UN, where she finally spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was invited on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection at the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Level Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia can no longer smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true for smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow of the Agency of Tass. The ban will enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore count with a fine of 3,000 rubles (EUR 42,46). If the cigarette should extinguish a fire, the punishment will fall higher. The ban also falls on burning candles followed by the ministry. Even meat can be grilled on the balcony, it is no longer allowed.
Fight against cybercrime - Find out about servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators first raised a large server provider for illegal business in the dark.
In total, 13 girls are in doubt as the operator of a computer center in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Tarbach at the Mosul has hosted numerous websites to operate on the international crime scene.
This was part of the general government administration in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a large event. The Darknet is a screened part of the Internet.
Customers of the realists should, among other things, have been the world's second-largest darknet market site for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had hit the investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million Telekom router ended November 2016 was conducted by a public government agency via a server in Cyberbanker.
One such host was first raised in Germany, it was hot. A website provides the infrastructure for Internet presence.
In the case of access with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been studies in Germany and in the neighbouring country. It has been the result of almost five years of investigation. On Wednesday the investigators want to inform you about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people again want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement Fridays for Future redesigned actions and customer reviews in thousands of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests have been planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Köln, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Juchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westland on Sylt. Climateist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large competition in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests ► Who are actually Thunberg's backmen?
In the 21st century, there are high levels of crime and violence in a world full of war and smoking factories that heat the climate. So it's amazing that a 16-year-old girl who calculates the power of this time keeps the mirror in front of her nose. But what is behind it? Is there a readiness or a smooth marketing of a climateist? Historic performance or manipulative tactics for herself?
Greta Thunberg, on the other hand, places the masses in motion and brings young people up to a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically seen in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt exhausted in order to establish himself for a more just world. At that time, this also has been able to win a share of young people and it makes it possible to cross the sea to reach the fertile land, like Greta Thunberg recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow page about this? Why does an action called "We don't have time", to save the world? Besides, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to the girl who is in the framelight. The old-fashioned Follower by Greta Thunberg was also a little equipped over the last PR show, i.e. the trip with the boat was probably also some followers to dig. This is also not justified because the action came into the media very well for money and there is a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
The spirits are now different: Is it morally right to be financially secure in the salvation of the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together during the world’s rescue action with springmakers? Whatever the last position is involved, a critical and reflective view is increasingly important in a democratic society, as democracy lives by various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also make it very likely that it will be critical to question projects of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A foreign comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The doubts of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet is crossing our solar system - it is the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only doubted it, but now they've been certain: A comet of another star is crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is now employed by astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by Amateurastrones on the Crime · Global Voices
The infected body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crime. He looked at his first suspicion with a self-constructed telescope to heaven and further observation. It is actually about an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He is the second species he was seen on the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to explore insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as the Canadian Astrophysical Institute reports. The comet is clearly interstellar origin of the International Astronomy Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelway that brings it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before flight - and can be observed for several months
However, before it is so far, astronomers can observe him closely. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his flight, which means that he can be examined for many months from the earth. "The object will be achieved by mid-December and will still be seen by mid-April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," says Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Administration Nasa. "Then it will only be observed by October 2020 with even greater professional telescopes".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumumaa".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov gives hope in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers across. At the same time the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the wet stars is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems may form by similar processes as in ours, the León's colleague Javier Licandro added.
However, the observation is based on individual knowledge. Two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, allowing a new way of research into certain processes in other solar systems.
The researchers are always busy again. Soon a giant asteroid crossed the earth and approached them dangerously.
"Absolutely proselytized": Rachel Johnson recently told about Brother
About Boris Johnson it becomes more unique. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister calls the military language of the Premier as "smellless". It is not the brother she knew.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and continues to vote - at least once again. During the interrogation hours in the basement this Wednesday, the opposition was brought to a mass effect, and among others there were still critics of the word: thousands of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News, her brother using words such as capitalisation, as if the opponents of an EU-Austria should be "carried, beaten, quartered, beaten and burned". They held this to be extremely offensive. They did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who was represented in the European Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "change UK" elections.
In particular, she pointed out that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly subcontractor who was murdered a few days before the 2016 Austrian referendum by a neonazi. Her memories could have been the best honor by passing the Brexit. Boris Johnson had said in the basement. "It is very embarrassing to refer to a member who was murdered, calling 'Britatin first'," now criticised Johnson's sister. The father was apparently from the right-hand warehouse, which was strengthened by this kind of language. For all those who were suffering, it was very tasteless.
Also, Cox's Twitter criticised the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be, if you are patient and decide for what you believe - no matter what you look like. But never should you "demonise the other side". He also claimed that an atmosphere was created, which was likely to become more likely in the attacks.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo's office as a state secretary and his mandate as a tour coordinator. "I was in the last few months to experience a crisis between loyalty to the family and national interest - it's an inexhaustible tension," said Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language also stood on sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and bishops of the Church of England criticise the language "this country is not worthy". In a joint state they stated: "In the past days, the language has been unacceptable both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakara and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
In the year of her 100-year-old existence, the NFL has a strong sign: In the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl, two women are engaged in Latin roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at Super Bowl: Superstars Shakara (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver half-time show at the next end of the US football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (Orderday).
"I feel incredible and embarrassed to represent the Latin Community in addition to Jlo. Because this has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakara shared in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2nd. Many people live in the Metropolis on the southern tip of Florida with Latin American roots. Shakara ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Flor") is a porto-Canary source.
"I love that Super Bowl puts two women at the stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sent an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the year 2000, they were born with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actor and is seen in the "Hustlers" drama from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a Telenovela and singer. She created her first bilingual album in 2001 and the single "Weever, Everywhere".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time it comes with tension. In this year many also value the election as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time is a huge advertising spectacle. Musicers such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones provided for Furore. In general, over 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL terminal, it is also popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The conflict between the quarterback Colin Kaupernick, who refused to protest against police violence against black people, was fought by US President Donald Trump, and was finally criticized by many for their solidarity with Kaupernick. Some musicians rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink.
A player and Youtube puts Egypt's ruler to: First, Mohamed Ali remains more than ever in the country.
The two men who influenced the streets of Egypt had spent the past two weeks abroad. One of them moved back to Cairo on Friday. The President of State Abdelfat al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who replaced the first free president of the country, Mr. Mohammed Mursi, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had gone ahead against the political Islam and had not lost any human rights violations on the Nile in one week, saying that they had killed hundreds of people.
In the Irere, this is what the President of the other men, who is currently planning on the streets, is trying to do. Mohammed Ali remained of course in the country where he was denied access to the security forces that would immediately arrest him when he tried to join Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, only a minority of the Egyptian players were known. Today he is the toneling voice that governs the political discourse in the Cafés, the living rooms and the country's testhouses: with his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his country people against Sissi.
He goes directly to the Head of State and through Russian. While the people are hungry, the President's thirst for luxury, and he is allowed to build great new palaces, it is there. The military leadership, supported by the Sissi's government, brings about corruption and division. Since he has been working as a construction worker for 15 years with these Lords, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the exact number of clicks are displayed.
After last week, Sisis caught thousands of people in power against his government and nearly 2,000 citizens, among whom prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians were arrested, called Ali for this Friday to a "million march". That would be true for so many people on the streets, it was unlikely. But there were few protests brought together, such as in Giseh in Cairo and in the place of Luxor. Videos in social media, whose participants claimed Al-Sisi corruption and his departure. When these protests ended, the police also set up fires and rubber shots.
From Mansura City in Nildelta, where protesters marched last week's banner with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security checkpoints were established in the city and on the streets. In Cairo several U-road stations were closed because of "intention work" in the city, most roads were blocked around the stage of the 2011 revolution. And at the Rabaa Square where supporters of the murdered Muslim brother Mursi were defeated until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should be taken to prevent them from getting out of the city because of "resistance work" because of their "intention" work" that most roads were blocked around the heart of the revolution in 2011.
Mohammed Ali allowed these preparations to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the train station," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not meet with police officers." As a result, it's not understood: "The whole of Egypt is the train station".
If the supplier promises too much
Since the internet connection is always much slower than the provider, there are different test options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not have to trust in the provider's speeds openly. Customers can themselves check how much of this is actually achieved in case of accidents.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Central Bayern.
As the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various test options. Thus, the federal network agency's measuring tools (BNetA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the agreed rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the suppliers, however, are carried out according to specific standards and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the Consumer Center Bayern.
If the connection is significantly slower than it is announced, customers can set an appropriate period of 14 days for the provider to perform the promised performance. This is done in writing at the best.
If this does not affect anything after multiple demands, customers can also advertise and also demand damages. However, in the case of permanent success, only help with the cryowig.
First ranked Republicans for Research
As the first high-ranking Republican Governor of Vermont spoke for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, it is determined by the facts that will be determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistblelower business, before measures - an impeachment procedure could be taken to cancel the presidents.
Scott said he was not surprised by the enthusiasts that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selensskyj to investigate the intervention of the democratic presidentate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have long held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistbleblower victims; few have recognized their disapproval. Scott's warnings are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate republican, has already used himself against Trump's policy, such as the closure of environmental protection rules and the violation of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: More Marvel film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would be going different ways in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avenger" Universe. It was completely unclear how it should go on with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This reports several US media in harmony. This is why the film should also be set up: In the United States the film will run from 16 July 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying: "I am glad that Spiderys will continue the way in the MCU. I and all of us at the Marvel-Studies are pleased that we can work on it more ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universities, since Sony continues to work on his Spider version. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the immediate good news? It is likely that Sony Marvel will have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the company, which is also included in Marvel, would be involved with 30 percent of the inputs coming from Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry sleep in the "Suits" terminals
After nine staff members, the series "Suits" was held in the United States between the great finale. In the last instance, there were many happy endings and also many Cameo performances. Also, the Royal Wedding Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been working in the series for many years, was awarded the attention that follows sections contain sponsors to the series finale.
One way: Herzogin Meghan did not return to the final for a last decision as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed the most memorable scenes with today's herzogin. Like the moments of the divorced and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his departure from prison.
However, her true husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just shouted at the altar to marry his promised wife Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a lot of comment on its approach. If he has actually changed his mind, then the suspect Harvey wants to know from the wedding, just to say, "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Agais: Baby and four other children drink at boat accident
At the end of a flight boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat landed near the Greek island of Inouses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were on this route following the United Nations flight relief work (UNHCR). Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries will be visited.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wanted to "informed in Turkey how the refugee situation is", said Seahofer on Friday. He wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help in dealing with them.
A speaker from the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned voyage of Seafarers with EU Home Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of immigrants from Turkey. Only on Tuesday, 654 people settled on the Greek islands, it was attended by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey Deal still working?
The increased numbers have finally raised doubts as to the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who are illegally arriving on the Greek islands.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only possible on the Greek side because of personal deficiencies. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are nearly 29,400 people in Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people there are currently 5200 migrants.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many reports of the state-run operation.
Climate change: Hetze leads to more heart problems
Doctors will then test the health system in the future. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, says Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Cardiology Society. In particular, the heart racing system created high temperatures and high temperature sources in the short term and led to increased heart rate. In particular, people with heart disease, older people and diabetes are affected.
Green Politicians must answer for painful photopane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election - was this reason of the beaches manipulated?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a multiway beache in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The beache was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained almost undetectable - and finally disappeared. The re-useable coffee shelter with metal current has never held Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this beer in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and distributed to the media - and there was yet another black (Papp) becher as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chef has to answer for photo panels
The May National Post proposed manipulation and that the Party Fake News produce more credible on the subject of "Environmental protection". And that was in the middle of a election struggle for sub-home choice, in which Trudeau also became increasingly difficult because of a housing scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and made the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their passports."
May showed himself shocked and insisted on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. To underline this, she also posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a becher in her hand. However, she was right, she was from Bambus. She always had it. A party speaker said that it was just about having to submit the partilog in her photo, and not to change anything. From the photo there is only one chapter to see on the website.
May writes: "I don't want to name him stupid, but there's nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and said to her team, "If they have fun again, then they can't do anything with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens are also targeted for their use of entrance plastics or for flights to Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photographed. So that the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, in the holiday ice with plastic ceilings, as Markur.de* reported.
Influenzarin wants free upgrade: Long live flight ban at Cathy
Perhaps Jaqueline Ng was granted an upgrade by mail by Cathy Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she couldn't get on board - and she should never fly with Cathy again.
Spontan received an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free change from the economy class.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-declared influenzar has been actively praying for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, the Jaqueline staff refused an upgrade, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathy Pacific apparently looked at an upgrade. The letter wants to receive the influence of an airline marketing worker. The airline is accused of having lied to Jaqueline.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-range flight. This time the woman was to present the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport staff were skeptical: they hacked at the center. And indeed the employees who were supposed to have argued the mail contact with Jaqueline were also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines canceled Jaqueline's ticket and attached a live flight ban with Cathy Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about € 1,280), she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influenceer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represented the consumer's interests. Because Cathy had rewarded her price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also asked for the costs for the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail's metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathy, the influenzar has made a mistake, she remains blocked for future flights. The business conditions of the airline also say that they do not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now she has an attorney.
Oil prices according to report on gun status in Yemen
The oil prices fell on Friday within a short time. A barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea resort Brent was 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) range fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The resolution for the course course was a report of the Wall Street Journal on a gun stand in Yemen. Saudi Arabia should have approved a gun stand in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of the world's oil production in September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the Civil War had announced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia was responsible for Iran as the US government. A weapon stand would eliminate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is really possible, you can focus on growth and demand, says Ole Hansen, head of the department of raw materials strategy at the Saxon Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices continue to make its way down the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil was still costing up to $59, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg reported on Insider that the repair works at oil plants in Saudi Arabia had occurred faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Consequently, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original volume.
Recently, there were several press reports under appeal on sites that reported rapid progress by the State oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw materials experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently seeking to prevent a stirdown and negative breakout line.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted exemption on the way to the port. The crew is now preparing for departure while the ship is still in front of anchor, shipper Erik Hånell shared the Swedish roundfunk in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that they would launch rockets and soldiers into the Iranian army to Saudi Arabia. The fear of a scalding between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had significantly increased the oil prices in the past few weeks.
Priorities against the storm are forced
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, several leading government staff had tried hard to prevent the use of the speech after a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selenskyj Ende July. This was an anonymous indicator. The speaker of the representative House, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, presented the White House with an explicit "Translation". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds the third drop of Trump and Kim for question
North Korea has given rise to doubts that it will soon come to a third summit by Machthaber Kim Young-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success of such a meeting are due to the lack of progress in the implementation of the first summit agreements in Singapore, said the top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry's adviser. He also criticised US sanctions and the joint military over the US and South Korea. But he hoped for a "wise" and "strong" decision to bring it to an approach again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with Kim before it became clear. The negotiations on a suspension of the North Korean nuclear and rocket programme have taken place since the second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June both of them met in the intermilitary zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the consultations, but without great success.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers are supposed to help with mining
The British Prince Harry in Angola has figuratively healed and destroyed a bomb. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico he placed the ring. In a safe distance, the bomber exploded. In order to get Angola to 2025, he later asked all the countries whose names were on these weapons, but did not commit themselves to helping.
Printing Pund - Zinsenkung expected
Printed British Pound
In view of a low interest rate, the money is lost against the euro at value.
Frankfurt Speculations on an early interest rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) are set at the Sterling Pound. The British currency earned up to 0.4 per cent on Friday at $1.2269.
Exhibitors of the sale were statements by Nottenbanker Michael Saunders. This led to a censorship in conversation even if a Chautic Brexit could be rejected, since insurance would affect the British juncture at a time when it would be invisible. These statements were surprising, since Saunders was considered to be the winner of a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhouse ActiveTrades said.
Last week the Bank of England had already pointed out the economic burden on the economy by Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a interest rate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country without a settlement agreement on 31 October.

Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the sole director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World League of Lightballs.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping lab finally delivered the required tests from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Dodoping Agency (Wada). Now it appeared that they were false.
In December 2014, the Wada had been systematically involved in the Russian sport. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) had been blocked for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not totally tied by the world stage. The International Olympic Committee was present after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag, at the February 2018 Winter Games were 168 Russian athletes and athletes at the start. Also at the World Cups in the various sports groups, they had to be at the same time in the summer as the Fusssball-WM in Russia.
Missing positive
The next September, the Wada reopened the Rusada band, but requested access to the laboratory and the infected samples. The data should be completed on the extent of the translation of Doping cases at state doping. They should help punish athletes and athletes overnight. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The President of the Independent Integrity Commission (IAU) of the World Trade Union (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in his interview on "Frankfurter General Journal" of Friday. "We have identified a number of discrepancies between the data received by Wada by a Whistleman and those received by the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren report.
The WM is not concerned
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light-Tatellitetic Association is held as the only organization in Ban Russia. At the WM in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They have to prove that they train outside the Russian system and take tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been put into space and Russia had urged Russia to respond to the premise within three weeks. Russia is now taking over the new spree of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
