It must be done immediately.
Take it, I said.

It's you she loves, not me.

A lot of people were injured.
You like lax?

No one hacked me.
How'd it go?

I'll clear up the spindles.
I don't want this.
I love that story.
Tom hated it.
I speak Japanese, English and French.
I wasn't aware you were acting so bad.
I've been pretty busy.
We're both very old now.
I never trusted them.
I like that dress.
I hate to come too late.
No, you can't use my car!

What's that worth?

Tom took a tag in Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard that a South American camper was attacked by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we went over the lake.
Why does Tom never say hello to us anymore?
It's actually a good point.

The other kids call her Nasse.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom's teaching.
She's got too much work to do.
She's right.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Tom knows how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's not sure if the letter ever came up or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You think you're in bed all day, right?
Then Tom can't do it.
Tom kruckles under the tag wire.
I didn't even know what she was saying.
Do you really think you're gonna do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She's crying.
Can I see Tom today?
No one wants it.

Well, try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did you get Tom?
I'm going like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're longer than me.
Thank you for your birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I think I'm going to new places and see new things.
I've got to put myself down.
Aren't we friends?
Her number got me kicked out.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests if no one else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only talk for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom beat Mary.
You should have thought about it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six was invited, the boy included.
Kate's sorry.
I know you're missing your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems exhausted.
He's not mad.
There is no doubt about who is chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.

Get back in the car.
She helped the old man across the street.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of that was true.
There must be a pattern.
It's embarrassing to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom lied to me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the sock.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's out.
My dad's fresh.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll get ready without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
The words of Helsen immediately filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're mad.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That was exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, thank you.
What were you talking about?
The boy took a bite in the cat's ass.
How do you know?
I got a lot of soft beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will relieve you of your guilt.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the rest of the day.
Neither does it work.
I can explain.
She acts like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I can do all this.
Everyone needs water.
After the stop, the train accelerated fast.
What does that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to stay, but can you at least accept that there are people who have views other than you?
Tom's down the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of meeting him again.
Even during work hours, I pay my salary for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You haven't been away for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take me down to town.
Well, it wasn't really sad at all.
Can you freeze it?
Tom was blind with the light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to think I'd come here.
This isn't a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done it all they said they did.
There's no one here that's called it.
It's time to go.
All three men's history.
Come and get you.
It has to be long.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motorcycle's a mess.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.

Tell them the truth.
I love that tattoo.
You're Tom's favorite.
We took each other's hand on it.
I get it.
Poor isn't the one who has a little but the one who needs a lot.
It'd have been fun.
Tom disappeared quickly into the crowd.

I'm gonna start hanging out.
How old were you when you stopped believing in the dust?

Who are you meeting?

That's still right.
The police have arrested a suspect.
It's cool.
She can't stop me.

How did we do that?
You're the best dad ever.
Tom's a deserter.

Tom's a member?
This is a real Solomonic solution.
The cat on the table is asleep.
Medus knocks on the door.
This is the best ship I've ever been on.
I'm good at my job.
How come you won't buy a blue?
I don't know yet.
It's a bad habit.
I asked Tom to stop.
The worst thing about the summer is this.
Where can you buy bus tickets?
Are you studying or working?
Can't I stay here with you?
I can survive alone.
We're in a recession.
I have a question.
Tom was successful.

His explanation was not enough.
We were proud of Tom.
I don't think Tom did anything about it.
I've got my headache.
That's exactly what I need.
I got to know where she was.
Explain it to me.
You must be very busy.
Where's my stuff?
