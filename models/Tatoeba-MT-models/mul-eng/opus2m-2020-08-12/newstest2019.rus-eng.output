Named number of new subscribers from Ukraine to Donbass
The official representative of the People ' s Police of the declared Lebanese People ' s Republic (LNR) stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new subscribers to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.

"The refusal of Ukrainian citizens to serve in a number of Ukraine's VCs led to the low integration of units," said Markochko, quoted by RIA News.
It also did not rule out that actual numbers of Ukrainians ' troops could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which later changed into the Joint Forces (ODS).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian forces in addressing the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasse was compounded by the murder of the head of DNA Alexander Zacharchenko.
The DDR authorities qualified what happened as a tactic.
Several persons were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that there was a difference in the organization of Ukrainian services.

With that statement, the diplomat spoke at the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, opened on 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the post of Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask settled their dispute on fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the telecommunications, within the framework of the agreements reached by Moscow, the Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla must be removed.
In doing so, the Commission has enabled Moscow to maintain its position as Head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla is also required to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the injured investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mass is an American entrepreneur who is listed as 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the director of SpaceX SpaceX, neurotheological company Neurallink and the developer of Tesla electricians, as well as the developer Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously appealed to the Director-General of Tesla Ilon Masca for his communication published on Twitter on the possibility of buying the company.
Last month, Moscow announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the $420 share was established as "because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana", the Bloomberg agency reported earlier with reference to the security department of the Stivena Beijing Commission.
Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares from his plans.
Commenting against him by the US Commission on Price Books and Prices, the businessman stated that he considered fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and impressed by these claims.
"Hence is the most important thing in my life, and the facts prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective appeal against Moscow, complaining of financial losses.
The researchers claimed that the businessman's mail brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that businessmen had been misled by the fact that the salesmen of Tesla had been forced to buy books at artificially increased prices to cover their positions.
Other scholars have also noted that the unobservable statements of Ilon Masca have led to serious setbacks.
In September, Ilon Masca charged the head of Citron Research research company with bullies.
In the meantime, if Moscow could not resolve its dispute with the US-based bookstores and exchanges commission, it would risk his removal from the company's leadership and even prison.
In particular, the former President of the Commission, Harvey Pitt, made a statement to the CNBC telecanal.
Mass is "a bad guy who can't manage a car company."

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought praise to Fleming and made it the Nobel laureate.
In fact, penicillin was not the first opening of Fleming.

They were found in almost the same case as penicillin.
The name Fleming was included in the list of 100 most prominent individuals in human history.
Its opening, many scientists believe, has changed history.

Nizzia called for the "Moscow language for the Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian child writer and fighter for the purity of the native language, Lars Nitz, called for the removal from Ukraine of the "Russian-Musco product and the Moscian language".
To do this, she offers the Ukrainian product "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
With its views on "the desirability of the elimination of Russian in Ukraine" Nice shared with the Ukrainian edition "The Foster".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already available and continues to develop.
In time, Ukrainians "heal" from this "Musco language", she was convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been widely used on television and radio, but it was not in public areas.
However, according to Nizza, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of Russian-speaking authorities, she believes, are only “increasing the border for the Ukrainian word at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nizza had experienced the support of the Ukrainian regime in the children ' s camp in Karpatas, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened the U.S. Library Network, one of which she met in Russian.
When she didn't get it, Nizzie turned into a girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling the Ukrainians to reject Russian letters even in family writing.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger could not even be avoided by the Ukrainian Security Service: when I came there and heard the conversation between the staff members and the Russians, she made a scandal and went away and knocked at the door.
A man's conversation was interrupted, and it brought fruit.
"Urala" protector Dennis Kulakov - a victory over "Arsenala" (2:1) in the 9th tour of Russia's campaign.

"This complex game has been achieved, there has been a serious male conversation, and this has led to its fruit: two cats have been killed and they have not been missed.
"You missed a few fights because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did he feel today?"
"If it took 90 minutes, it means it's all right!
In fact, he felt good about himself.
Maybe, at the end of a little while, there's nothing going on.
And so, Dr. Vladimir Anatolevic Gasnev and Physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevic brought me to this game, which is very grateful to them!
"What do you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's not for anyone to hide that after victory and recovery, it's easier to build up in a collective good.
Now we've got a white job, even though it's been black.
It is necessary to continue with the same spirit and to please the patients."
"Have you been out of the game since he didn't go to the field?"
"That's why it's been a while since the really unpleasant situation has gone up.
But again, thanks to the physical therapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and advised the patients.
And the rest is all secondary."

The head of the Federal Council for International Affairs, Constantine Kosačev, considered the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and did not exclude it from becoming a backer to the IMF as an inalienable participant in the resolution of global global problems.
"The uniqueness of the present 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we've been accustomed to in recent years to Russia has now been more appealing," said the senator in an interview published in the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the RFF "has been identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with the Ebola scourge, as well as climate change or terrorism, in this case Russia has been in a number of cases in the exhibition of a group of Western countries, which has been quite unanimous on this account."
At its 73rd session, Kosačev stressed that "the issue of Russia in the negative key was practically missing".
"If the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not currently taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, in any case, human beings were not perfect," he said, pointing to politics, pointing out that Russia "was no longer a wall on which to train a tennis match."
The head of the Softed Professional Committee does not rule out that this is evidence of a trend which he believes will “distribute the current session [of the United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may occur within a year or two or three”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be reversed," Kosačev explained, "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, it brought the situation to Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"However, it is not Ukraine, but I am sure that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be interrupted in time," Parliament added.
This is related to, he believes, "the appropriate, healthy recovery of Russia as not just a possible and inalienable participant in addressing global issues of modernity".
"I don't want to go wrong, but I feel like we're going through a point where the movement won't be moving back, it'll move forward," he added.
Another "interestful and important feeling" in this context, Kosačev called "the question of how to develop a modern world".
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly], Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergey Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of the world, in large numbers no one has been interested in, is now different," said the Chairman of the Soufeda Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal order which is in line with the West, there is no answer to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration”.
"And here the demand for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosačev expressed his conviction, stressing that in this sense "the current successful session for the work of the Russian delegation which is successful for Russia".

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idliba
Damascus hopes that there will be no military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, the head of the IID of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
In his view, Syria has the right to this.

Terry led the young Chelsea team.
It was previously reported that the 37-year-old protector had negotiated a transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, former English collective captain John Terry led the young Chelsea team.
According to a source known as the game, the long-standing London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.

The first vice-president of the Supreme Council, Irina Geraštenenko, apologized to the "spyonaz" of the Ukrainian journalist Romanus Sustenko for not yet able to release him from custody.
She said this in her video address to a political prisoner who was sentenced to the second anniversary of the unlawful arrest of the Soviet FSB.
According to her statement, in those days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris there was an action that had been declared a hunger strike demanding the release of Kremlin's supporters.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural workers, among whom there are well-known people, are starving, with the support of Oleg Sencov, other political prisoners of Crimea, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview where President Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not require pressure on Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one requirement - the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Romania, the release of all political prisoners of Crimea and the children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crime," Gerastanko said.
She also expressed confidence that trials would surround each Ukrainian, making us “more difficult to protect the national interests of Ukraine, to protect each Ukrainian, to understand what is good and what is bad”.
It is recalled that the correspondent of Ukraine in France, Roman Sustenko, was detained by Russian troops on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying on the Office of the Chief Intelligence of Ukraine ' s Minoboron.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sustenko to 12 years of hard-to-state colony, and the Russian Supreme Court recognized this verdict as legitimate.
The Russian prisoners were satisfied with the last request of the Ukrainian before his colonization.

Washington, D.C., on cancer control
Many artists are now talking about how they have managed to cope with oncology.
Sadly, no one suffers from it, and the history of the people of the world over cancer gives hope to many patients.
A well-known actor, Wahtang Kikabidde, admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago he was diagnosed with a terrible condition that sounded like a punishment.
"I was hit like a kid's head down.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They're in the hospital.
I couldn't keep it there. I couldn't stand it. It's all gone.
They started to do tests, it seemed that bad things didn't happen, that the artery wasn't bleeding.
They took me to Moscow, where they said that I had a big hot box in my head, and they had an operation immediately.
And during surgery doctors saw the bone marrow," Kikabide said in the program "Sometimes."
Opuhol became a criminal.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to forgive the Kumiri for his home.
But the actor's wife didn't allow her to protect the living actor, she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and that she had not been away from her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.

The authorities called the amount of the gold parachutary of the U.S. Governor
At the same time, 23 salaries were paid by the Deputy Governor of the Voronej area, Yuria Agibalov, on the basis of the regional law on public posts.
At the same time, the actual amount of gold parachute released from the official's office was several times less than the amount heard in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press.
According to the law, the salary for the post of Agibalova is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the amount of the same-time payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, not 1 million rubles written by the media.
The official received an old-age insurance pension in July 2018.
Its status in public office is more than nine years.
He was awarded this pension and a temporary payment was made immediately after the resignation of the post, explained to the RIA News Agency in the field.

On 29 September, the Nezigari Telegram channel published documents that indicated that Agibal, a member of the Deputy Governor ' s post, had paid out 23 payments and two days later he had received the same post without the “virio”.
The honourable Member called on schoolchildren to tell about the trauma of masturbation
The first Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on Education and Science was destroyed.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents are causing harmful information on the Internet.
To combat this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the MP added.
Ghennadi Onistenko, a member of the RF (intervention of the "Gourit Moscow" radio station):
In general sex education, children need to do this by explaining the killing, because there is a risk of both boys and girls being at risk of sexual health.
The problem is objectively, it is that children are being raised early enough, and there are still large gaps between their sexual orientation and the possibility of formal contact between them.
According to Onistenko, solutions to the problem are “injurious”, reducing the “sex of sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child education.
The doctor is convinced that many adolescents are dealing with anonism.
The Member believes that practice of learning about the harm of anonymity is primarily in the schools of the "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just don't understand it, I'll speak to you easily," said the professor.

AdG became the second popular in Germany
The Anti-Immigrant Alternative for Germany is a regular record of popularity, and the rankings of Angel Merkel are falling.
In general, the Germans began to insist on the immigration policy of Angel Merkel, which has served as a leading goal for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, the latest issues are that the anti-immigrant Alternative Party for Germany is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of the leading blockade Merkel and Zehoffer are weakening.
This week ADG killed a regular record by raising a second point in the ratings of national sympathies.
Legal conservators with 17 per cent of the population were able to occupy the social democracy, with about 16 per cent.
The breakdown in one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it cannot be noted that ADG from a small group of Eurosceptics economists in 2013 has succeeded in becoming a serious political force.
In general, leadership is still holding the HSS/HDS driving block, with about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards loss of glasses here. In April the support of Angel Merkel's block was at four percentage points above.
The staff rating of the German Chancellor is also reduced, which is headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth term.
Today, Angel Merkel is supported by 48 per cent of Germans, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, after social democracy, green (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and Liberia (10 per cent).
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the 2013 Alternative Election Group, in which delegates from the Christian-Democratic Union came out.
The Group was strongly opposed to the government course, but at first it was only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and the EU-wide interaction.
At the same time, the group spoke against the "suspension" of the weak economies of the EU, which did not preclude the return of the German flag and the full exit of the country from the EU.
As a result of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group was formed into a fully-assessed party that engaged our Eurosceptics and began to criticise the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the latest parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG was able to take the first time to Bundestag, receiving 94 MPs (from 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist named Ukraine's citizen "The Nation of Diseases"
The head of the political show on Ukrainian TV, author of the two books Ostap Drozdov in the immediate ephere, acknowledged that he considered his followers to be “the nation of the sick”.
They believe in television and they're reading.
As Drozdo noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We are not attracted to the culture of reading and acceptance of texts from childhood," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately quoted the words of the Friendly Critic, accusing him of being absent from patriotism and greed.
As noted earlier, the State Television and Radio Committee had begun to fight the literature that had little intention to criticize the Chinese authorities, prohibiting the import of up to 201 copies.
Manchester City played Briton and took the lead in the APL.
In the seventh round of England's Manchester City champion on his field, he played "Bryton" with 2:0.

Named after the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
The study of the international collection of scientists is presented in the library of electronic press arXiv.org and is directed to the publication in the publication Publications of the Astronomic Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were followed by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru with about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and darkness energy, which amounts to over 95 per cent of the world ' s energy mass, studied under the standard LCDM space model (L Cold Dark Matter), they assessed the expansion rate of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously considered.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of material in the universe and that the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters.
In July scientists modeled the potential death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had provided new evidence that the world would end its existence after 22 billion years as a result of the Great Breakdown.
There was a failure to bring together pensioners
The opportunity to learn about the people ' s view of pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday, a general federal initiative group met for a referendum against pension ageing.
It was attended by 13 subgroups that recorded various forms of issues (all five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to call on the CIC with a request for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Have you not increased the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to ageing pensions by 1 July 2018?"
This form was registered by a group of volunteers who did not participate in the congregation but who considered it to be the most simple and legal step.
Most of the members of the congregation were members of the “Justice of Russia” Ili Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups from New York, Voroneg and Orenburg joined them.
Earlier, Surido spoke of "Wedmostos" that invitations were sent to all the participants, and about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, the leader of the Vogue Sub-group (the 15 other sub-groups supported her), said "We know" that she did not receive and did not plan to go: "We didn't understand who was another and who was the enemy."
Death of the Blue Song of Otis Rosh

I've already said that sometimes the goal is to work on it.
And what we've won is very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripi a ride in this series?"
"We have our program he works for.
That's why it was so decided," says Billettin's press service club.
Ilon Mask will leave the post of Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will have to leave the position of the President of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay the fine of $20 million.
While the businessman maintains the position of the principal executive director of the company, AFP reports with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also pay a fine of $20 million.
The former regulator directed against Ilon Maska's search -- the officials thought he had led the Tesla investors astray, as the businessman allowed the purchase of all the company's shares at a high price -- $420 per book.
In the game "Loco" - "Ahmat" the mistakes of Turbina were like a red bead.
Former U.S. judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Arbitrary Evgen Turbin in the 9th round of the Russian Lokomotiv campaign and discussed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the trial of Eugenia Turbina in the Lokomotiv game - Ahamat?
- I think this judge has confirmed his inconsistencies with the trial of the Russian Prime Minister.
I am surprised that the efforts made at the fifth Spartacus, Dinamo, or Turbin itself, did not make serious findings on its low-qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: the errors in its actions, the private failure of gross acceptances were due to exorcism.
For example, at the 50th minute of the Edera railway, the defence officer "Ahmata" Rodolfo falls by hand in his penal area.
It's eight meters from the door, but Turbin doesn't wear pens.
- How do you assess the episode with Ido's participation, which was at 82 minutes when it was shown that the sword had fallen into his hand?
- I think this was the idea of a protective hand game in his criminal area.
The turbine was in a series of moments, and the episode and his first assistant to the case were very good.
This was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the pens were not assigned.
As a result, the account in the case was found in the case of a match, and the sporting justice came to an end.
This was the same case when the judgment of the concept was exaggerated and preserved by the athletic spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guardian of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against the Crimea, and when the judge showed him a wish card, he was adversely affected.
What do you think of this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "guarantee"?
At this point, Turbin and the first wish card didn't show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match on two standards of justice that some of the orders were put in prison for such violations as in the Iddo episode and something else.
What do you value the words of a football player?
- I think it's under two standards.
It was a panel.
Don't give it to him.
Thus, the arbiter does not give a second penelette to the opposite door.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge's watching who's playing.
There he played Lokomotiv on Saturday and Ahmata had serious claims for the work of the Turbin because the team was injured.
Matt Damon played the defendant for rape judge Cavano at the old SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Brett Cavano, who was charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturday Night Live broadcast on the NBC.
During a small shooting, the actor played Kawano on the hearings in the prosecution hall.
The United States Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to its emotionality and details during its discussions with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Yes, Cavano repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but he said that he never drank before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself for rape, Kawano stated that he was a girl during that year.
These moments were also played by Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudst, most drunk girl I've ever seen.
"Everyone knows that," said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Previously on Cavano had been elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbara Strazand found out in her cloned dogs of curiosity
American singer Barbara Strazand said that her dead dog's clones are totally different from the original pittemmer.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, they look like it, but it's impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Strazand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old coton de Tullair family on behalf of Samantha, who had to cope with health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the most small dog in the world had cloned at the age of 49.
Experts are dealing with the cloning of six-year-old animals in an attempt to understand why it is so minor.
The United States dollars had been concerned about Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to benefit from the global energy market.
The US authorities have been so keen to fight for the success of the global carbon market that they are ready to flee to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
The U.S. MD head Ryan Zinke told of the possibility of the sea blockade.
Despite world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police force, but civil functions, including natural resources policy.
Therefore, Zinca's statement went fully into the competence of its head of office, although it was not left out of the political area.
In his speech at the industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the United States military forces control maritime routes in the Middle East region and may block them if necessary.
In Zinka's words, the need for Washington ' s desire to mix Russian supplies into the world energy market could be linked.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a low share of its income from global supply of oil and gas.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the activation of Moscow in this region, convinced by Zinka.
The Minister explained that the United States continues to count on leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
For this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade is an acceptable measure on this path, says Zinka.

Formula 1 Gran-pre-Russia Hongka
In Russia there was a club I'd like to follow.
The former Chelsea Captain and the English General John Terry - why he visited the 9th tour of the Russian Spartacus champion Spartacus (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I follow.
I've been following him for so long and I've been interested in looking at him from the side.
I can't say I'm a patient, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision," says Terry, "Chelsi."
Remember, Roads with 18 eyes were raised on the third place in the tournament table and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line, having 15 eyes active.
In the next round, on 7 October, white and white are playing with Enise, and the loyal Valerie Karpin will be home the day before Orenburg.
The road script was placed in a bomber's locker for no reason.
When LBC Boutique and Loan men brought a script in the city of Somerville (Massachusetts), a man offered a total of $50 for an old and unpresentable tool.
But the experienced shop manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool and consulted the expert.
It was found here that the script was produced in 1759 by the so-called Italian script master Ferdinando Galiano and is valued at $250,000.
Only one script scan is estimated at $16-18 grand.
The investigation revealed that the script had not been stolen from one of the city's residents long ago, and the instrument had returned to the legal owner.
As long as it doesn't know how the script hit a man, we're gonna put her in the lobby, but there's no previous contact with the law.
The manager said that now all those who contributed to the Lombard script would be asked to play on it to make sure it really belonged to the client.
In the ninth tour of the RPL, we are awaiting the overwhelming opposition: "Spartacus" will take over at its Tashina "Rostos" Stadium under the direction of Valeria Carpin, a human being, of course, not a "people's team".
The special feature of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of glasses - by 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-reaching "Zenata" and being in one eye from "Crasundar", which will play with "Dinamo" tomorrow.
In the red and white sphere now, the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the command of Massimo Carrrery was suddenly captured by the Rapidu, and recently entered the house of Ahmatu.
After a trial with the CSCA, which ended with a fair nothing, Spartacus played a minimum and not without work in Quebec of Montenegro, and as early as it was to discuss whether the most popular Russian club was nearing its exit from the crisis.
The three races could not win, so the defeats don't know five of them anymore.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the endless series of such a principle to himself as a fighter.
The previous Caribbean "Rosta" meeting with "Spartacus" ended with a headquarters command.
It started at 19:00.

London has been accused of Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defence Minister Gavin Williamsson.
But England will protect its values, he stressed during the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
As the threat increased, Iran and North Korea are increasingly at risk, the enemies are operating in the major areas through cyberattacks and false news, the Minister added.

Such Western policies have repeatedly been challenged by Moscow by TAS.
At the same time, British MID Head Jeremy Hunt reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it would not adhere to international rules and use weapons.

The translator compared the thinking of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding each other.
On the International Translation Day, 30 September, professional translator Berbel Saxe told about this.
It has been translated into Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as stated in the statement, "have been urged to go quickly."
But I think it does not play a major role in understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator," said a specialist in the RIA News commentary.
According to the translator, in order to understand that two countries do not care about each other, "it's enough to know history."
And in the future, she noted, Germany has no intention of ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, it does not make sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there's a lot of things that define our common destiny," she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angel Merkel had said that the country was trying to "link and support relations" with Russia.
It said that Berlin was particularly important for the North River - 2 pipeline project from the border of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

"The Collegiate has been talking about Sibiri patients, and I want to mark our patients," says the official White website.
"I hope they will support it the same way because almost every game is a full stadium, a different atmosphere.
By the way, it is likely that the Lord has helped Siberia today because they have made a very serious mistake, especially our leaders.
We've already lost the micro is match 0:3 our leading leaders, so it's been hard for us to get out of this match, although there were moments.
But still, I'm going to blame myself.
'Cause we've probably let it go. That's in preparation.
It was another command compared to the previous match."
"It's an unicorn."
The audiences are excited by Agutina's election to the "Golos" show.
The viewers of the "Golos 60+" charge the teacher Leonida Agutina with "unsubstantiated cumulation and pressure."
When he first heard the voice of his father, Nicholas Agutina, in secret, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executive.
But his son's feelings went up, and he chose a relative in his command.
Many then thought it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for the lack of objectivity at the first stage.
But "shut" got stuck, and the star's father was totally unfair to take the place of more honorable performers.
And now the victims are not willing to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we saw the show, protesting the shameless and open opposition of our close relatives to the final stage.
I even doubted that Agutina would be strong enough and that it would not touch her dad until the end of the day," Irina Petrovskya and Xenia Larine discussed in the TV program "Man".

"I meet the voice participants from the Agutina team -- they've been fired."
"Agutin showed how he loved the pope last time, and today he had to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave them in the project of their father who is not going to take and jump, how can he then be called a teacher?"
"It's like the Pope's poet, organize a concert in Cremla for his money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a "Golos" show, not a "Cruit Family" show.
"It was unprofessional by Agutin."
"Then we have to offer our own show to speak to the pope, not to the show that's being held for the money of 1 Canal."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the pope should have more understanding than any other participant with actual physical data.
Why did the surgeon from the Surgut come out with a great voice and a cloud, and the Pope Agutina brought him to the end?
And then we're all sorry that on stage and off screens the same person for decades!
So that you will not be able to break the yoke of pride."
"What are you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a blue circle. It's a comedy.
And the family budget will not be wasted!
The theater's on its way!"
The same user was reminded that during one of the traditional "Volse" seasons, the son of Gradski was raised in silence.

Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

According to him, the scientific community is now developing its focus.

The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the race for Gran-pre-Russia.
"I'm telling you honestly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and the second time I was in between the two cars that suddenly hurt me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start right away.
He was in a very bad position.
He got shot in traffic.
It was hoped that after the others joined the Pitto, we would fall into the "clean air" and return the pace, but there was no more rain.
Plus fought with a partner, he was also contacted.
I understand he made a few mistakes.
We've been in such a situation for the most urgent part of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and that was very painful if it was true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA "News".

The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpišev commented on the removal of the Moscist footballists Denis Gluschakova and Andreya Eştenko from training with a major component following the criticism of the chief coach of the Masimo Carrery, reports "Sport Weekden".
Carrier's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is indiscriminate folly.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It's just deepening the division in the team.
First of all, these are verses, read and understand them as appropriate.
I wouldn't have responded to this at Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get better.
If Glushakov and Eshtenko are lying, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I don't think Italians can handle the flexibility of the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal environment in the team.
Today, Spartacus has no games, so this situation was not to be resolved at all.
Maybe you should have laughed about it once.
Spartaca has a lot of different lines, and there is uncertainty after the introduction of youth.
The relations within the team, judges at all, do not add optimism to this fight," Tarpistev assured.
The game of two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19 a.m. after Moscow time.

Sirius students discussed science-like technologies
The students at the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, the Agrobiology and Genetics School of Plants attended a lecture by the National Research Centre of the Kurchatos Institute.
The statement of researchers was made under the programme of the Global Forum of Convergent and Similar Technologies, organized in Socia by President Vladimira Putin, on 29 September, on the website of the educational centre.
The lecture opened a documentary film "Codes of Kurchatova", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, member of RAN Correspondent Mikhail Kovalchuk, told of global challenges as a driving force for civilisation.
A student's lesson is published on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technologies needed a large amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such amounts.
To address this problem, according to the forum organizers, natural technologies that young scientists are working on today will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for developing such technologies, as well as the risks posed by the creation of such technologies.
"The availability of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a colossal advantage.
This is an explosive growth in medical technologies, which is an improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of such technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of living systems.
There is a trading party - targeted intervention in human life.
There's always a risk.
A car appeared, and people started to move under the wheels.
But cars still use the same thing.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology and I can create weapons of mass injury," says a scientist REN TV.

Macedonia: The referendum was not due to low light
The referendum was called upon to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the name of the Balkan country in North Macedonia.
Greece opposed the use of Macedonians to name its historical province.
The renomination led to the opening of the route to NATO and later to the EU.

"It's a dome, not a pasta.
There's something I want to do there.
Of course, you will not say that they are guilty of it, but it has not happened."
Otherwise, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animal welfare was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
To walk and walk - how right?
The word press does not exist.
That's right.
The word "pressure" means "dangling, exerting influence and influence" only literally because we hear the sound [and] instead of the word "extreme".
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "pressure" are ethomologically not only close but even in some way contradictory.
Make sure it's the same.
Two-year-old church means "full, complete, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, to be satisfied."
Satisfying, pleasure is a family word.
He used to have the importance of "no matter what, having self-satisfying" - "self-satisfied."
The old Slavian "come" literally means "good" and "good".
Let me guess. The others are perfect.
These words are the following threatening "families": daos - "wolk" (sheathing sheep), die - "murder" and both - "press".
A similar phony form of the word “pressure” and “pressure” as well as the inevitable ageing of the last was forced into contamination.
We have thus shown the same "d" that are used in writing through "a", which is better, incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of occurrence and development of these words.
So that's right.
But it's an older word, in its correct sense it's no longer in use.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you above, use the word "give".
You can also use the "pressure" structure, but remember that it is office.

"I'm sorry, yes, but you never know how things will turn out.
It's not gonna be easy in any case, because our car is rather slower than Merdès.

Russia has protected itself from terrorists through operations in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the Air and Space Forces.
This was discussed by former head of the Russian military operation in Syria, head of the Federal Defence and Security Council Committee, Victor Bondarev, on the third anniversary of the launch of the Russian military operation in Syria.

According to Bondareva, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria for three years, for example, on ammunition stocks, power stations and headquarters.
With the help of Russian planes, the Jihadists' defense has been violated, which has been a decisive contribution to the promotion of the Syrian Government's troops, transferring Interfax.
In addition, according to Bondareva, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia itself to recover from terrorists, many of whom were Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and the Djibouti-an-Nusru (restricted in Russia).
According to the GNSTAB, on the IG side, four thousand Russian civilians and about five thousand post-Soviet nationals were fighting against TASS.
And it's only about fixed persons, not those who were not identified, that emphasized Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country ' s territory.
Thus, Bondarev noted that Russia is fighting international terrorism in Syria on the other side of the border - otherwise the evil would "fall on us".

Mittropolith Ilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UPC with the actions of the Fascists
The head of the Synod Division of Foreign Churches of the Russian Orthodox Church Ilarion compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against Jews.
"It's all the same that in Fascist Germany's Jewish belief in the creation of a jealous obscenity star means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill has been created," said the Mittropolith in the Russian-24 television era (Interfax quote).
In his view, this step will have the most serious implications, especially now that the Russian-Ukraine conflict is at a critical stage.
In this way, Kiev hopes to have full control of the OPC and to “put it out of the law”, the priest thinks.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and those who believe in it consider themselves Ukrainians, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously known that the Members of the Supreme Council were working on the implementation of Bills No.4128 (on the change in the subordination of religious communities), No.4511 (in particular the status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).

Taking into account the situation and information we have and the threats that are spreading, it is obvious that we have to survive," said the Mittropolit.
He asked for support - a prayer, a moral one.
Also, the manager of the lab stressed that "your physical presence will probably be necessary."
The priest added: "The daughters of Lenin are spiritually dangerous and therefore protect their sanctuary."
Those who do not have an inseparable trial of the Pacheet Lavre - a righteous Ukrainian and a world festival must be prepared to protect it are spoken of in the course of action.
The Mittropolith called out against those who led the believers astray.
WPC has legal status as defined by Tomos since 29 October 1990 by Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to get involved in the novelty patriot and the other Roman Catholic pope Varfolome.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're satisfied with the status that our church has," said the owner of the lab.
He recalled that since October 1990, OPC has been legally independent and fully independent of its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need to do with Tomos?" said the Mittropolith of the First World, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other confessions of Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believed in some way were confused and determined in what temple they were going to go to.
However, someone wants to see her face and divorce again.

The lava is located at the top of the Mount of Bechaev, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical information on it relates to the beginning of the 13th century.

Much has been said about the rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September in Tehran.
There, multilateral consultations were held with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary-General of the Security Council, Nicolai Patrusev.

This year has become a record of the number of blood claims that killed thousands of simple Afghans," Patruev noted.
Afghanistan's poverty began not long ago.
Following the events of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (abstained in the RF), occupied in Afghanistan.

50 per cent of the Taliban movement (restricted in the RF).
Another 10 per cent are terrorists of the IGIL (restricted in the RF).

Lüpko Petkovski, a politician: "By this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia has the right to a better future, with the hope of public change.
And Greece will strengthen the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone truly happy."
On behalf of the country, the ruling social Democrats are headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against-conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Cvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no reason to enter the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement are of the opinion that the current socialist government, in its head with Zeev, is bound outside to change the name of the country.
However, this decision would have a negative impact.
First of all, I'm losing sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country's been torn apart.
The elections made by Macedonian citizens will determine not only the future of the Balkans but also Europe as a whole."
