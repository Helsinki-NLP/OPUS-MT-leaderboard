Members of the Galles National Assembly concerned about "passing for Marinenets"
Gallo elections are challenged by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallo Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the French Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the House believe that this could be done by rail.
An employer election indicated that his group was concerned about the fact that the cycle "remotes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-original readers of the Wales Country: in Gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Cymru Plaid (Part of the Wales Country) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionett), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Gallo, your letter is spoken as the letter or in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing a change of name, stated that "the final decision on the designation of members of the Assembly shall be returned to the latter".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 Act 2007 gives the Gallo Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Gallo Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission considers it to be in favour of Members of the Gallo Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach agreement might be a real challenge for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name at the debates on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the amendment of the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country must now bear the name “Northern Republic of Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to resolve a happy old one of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbours, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens insisted on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, indicated that he would not take account of the results.
However, participants such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, St. Martin's watches reduced to silence
"The elderly people I've discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church at each street corner," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more than today."
According to him, it is normal for bars to be re-refreshed.
Today, "we don't often do the same thing, explain it.
"Before, we went to the bar as his neighbor, but this is no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted before the officials imagine it and this concerns them: "Soon or later they will return to the house."
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help to keep the last sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be a large part of the Whites who will precipitate the closure of all the churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he wondered.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white methodist congregation leaves places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached around, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was re-encouraged by a black community under the direction of the River John Howard Johnson, which launched a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main trading streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were punished for their use or for their promotion.
In 1939 a fire shook the building, but Father Johnson's Parisians were preparing to rehabilitate and ordered a new trailer,
that the son and successor of Father Johnson to the Church of Saint Martin, the River David Johnson, proudly called the "times of the poor".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him another name: "an cultural treasurer" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
It also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin didn't replace him.
Over the last few months, there has been a lot of questions about the return of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese of the other.
In July, the Parisian Council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose on him the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians have been disappointed by the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old adolescent injured by a shark in a fishing area
According to the authorities, a requisition attacked and wounded a 13-year-old young Saturday last Saturday while he practiced fishing in California on the day of the start of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel indicated to KSWB-TV, San Diego's TV channel, that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy cry for help and got paid up to him to get out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought the young boy was putting up with crises of joy to have a seizure, and then he understood that he was real.
He was murdered.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fraction of the keyboard.
"I beg that everyone come from water: there is a requisition!" Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of the requisition to the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, Deputy Chief Larry Giles reported that a requisition had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad until Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles indicates that there are more than 135 species of claim, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Saninsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetic Market
Saninsbury's hands are made low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the ranges of rays similar to those of the supermarket, including aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
In the context of a major perpetuation in the British aesthetic market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and house products are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is final.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Saninsburys indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will be understood for the first time by such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of Bots.
The supermarket also links its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Saninsbury's stores, the first open last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second open in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket managers need to cross their heads to attract consumers, who are more likely to carry out their online purchases and to turn to food shops for daily food.
Mike Cope, director general of Saninsbury's, said that sales points will be more like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Saninsburys has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened several ports of Habitat stores since the purchase of two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed sales of current consumer goods and to make purchases profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the ranges of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics of the British chain were due to an error.
In the early 2000s, Saninsbury's tried a partnership with Boots, but it ended up in a polemy regarding the distribution of benefits from pharmaceuticals introduced into supermarkets.
It was after selling 3 years ago his 281 pharmaceuticals for a total of 125 million sterling books in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, which the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role there that was to introduce a wide range of high skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Saninsburys, announced that the appearance of beauty products has been changed to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the improvement of our radios and the ideal situation of our facilities, our governance of the cosmetic market is now inconsistency and changes shopping habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's retirement of an agreement of 11 million £
E-mail of the star of the television program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the retirement of an animator Holly Willoughby of an 11 million € contract related to his home decoration brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this morning's animator announced on Instagram that she would quit.
Holly Willoughby became angry with Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activity in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that Jones was angry when the dear television child found out, at a meeting held under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den Star Trade Center in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million sterling books, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could double the value of the fortune of the estimated animator at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she had left Truly, Jones sauta in his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Great Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was far from one of Holly's priorities
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left the world without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen tomorrow, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this Morning's animator's departure, which includes among Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cost millions to society, due to important investments in products that come from shoes or bags, clothes or articles from the inside, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could also lead to long - term friendships.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 ; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples shared together on vacation and Peter Jones holds 40% of the parties in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity of ITV program.
A close source of Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his commercial activities.
The debate was loud, but finally we were worshiped.
Trump was shocked by the media that criticize him for his comment that some judge as "inflicted by a president", and to show that he was positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why has President Trump retired so much?"
He ran it, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
"I haven't dropped anything."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had shown favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified for the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, far from the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearization are at the point of death.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders, at the General Assembly of the United Nations, that the United States ' response to the first disarmament measures of North Korea is no "responsible".
He regrets that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his collection speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," said the North American president.
We've been involved in armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting, the release of hostages and the rest of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to play the role of the President, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this arena full of cracks, there are no more than 200 fronts in front of me," he criticised him at the point of duty to the crowd.
Tsunami: a deserted island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that devastated Lombok, foreign NGOs' aid was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, but no state of national disaster has been described as a condition required for international aid to be decommissioned.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international help, which is a little complicated," laments Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organisation Save the Children has set up a team to return to Palu, it does not always know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The national disaster management agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo indicated that the Indonesian authorities had assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be authorized to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the droughts it constantly suffered, the country is desperately in need of means to open its doors of nature.
Refugees were settled in Aceh, but they were rare in other literal areas.
Although a warning has been delivered, no siren of alarm has been detained in Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to use transport.
A hospital ship that had been placed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable amounts to return to the railways and roads.
However, the lack of funds has diminished Mr. Joko's government, which is called to represent the electors next year.
The head of state of Indonesia is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been killed by their homes, based on confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, machete weapons, bows and arrows and other rustic weapons.

Parliament: Cromwell's status, the last victim of a history rewriting attempt
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural assets in England, composed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "reasonable" and has qualified it as a "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that "in view of the current debate about the retirement of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's rise to the Westminster Palace must not be saved.
Cromwell did not order or lead iconoclastism during the civil wars of England.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas during the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell, sculptured by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the view that it had been for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, I would like to say of the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is precise or not a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that emerged in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracturing.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and remembered."
China: A Cochin Kills an Elder · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a coach in a market in the southeastern part of China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the arthralted and covered with blood near a porcelain on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, indicated the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig grower is preparing to inject pigs vaccines into a porcelain on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Province of Qinghai, China.
He had traveled with his cousin since Yunnan's neighbouring province on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the nearby porcelain was open.
He says that a huge male pig was inside and that his blood was sucking out of his throat.
A medical-legal report confirms that the 250 kg weighted animal mutilated the lift to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the driver's cousin, said that "his legs were covered and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04h40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig from the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong either to the lifter or to his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was infected to avoid any other incident and to allow police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, there have already been reports of swine attacks against persons.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously damaging the last one.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig began a galley climber on his tractor before his wife managed to distance him from him.
In 2012, while an Oregon farmer came to be destroyed by his chickens, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not primarily an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this kind of behavior.
"These are rather playful animals,
They don't have any intention of doing anything wrong.
It's enough to show them the respect they deserve," he said.
Ouragan Rosa's remains should cause strong precipitation in the South-East United States
According to the forecasts, Ouragan Rosa is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters of the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be intrusive in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds flowed at 135 km/h (Category 1) from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
During this period, depression begins to develop over the Pacific Ocean and in the East, towards the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Netherlands-California peninsula Monday as a result of the storm, Uragan Rosa will lead to intense tropical humidity to the North, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in the regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture combined with the approaching depression will create global torrential rains in the South-West over the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations ranging from 2.5 cm to 10 cm will result in dangerous Sudanian crossings, debriefings and potential landlides in the desert.
The adverse reactions will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per hour, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical moisture.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in the south-west regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Tropical rains are likely to cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to make progress in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitations.
Intensified rains could turn cannons into depleted rivers and oranges produce wind currents and dust bubbles by places.
The near depression will result in abundant local rains in several southern regions of the country, on the California litoral.
All the fluids can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debrillations and make the glazing.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Tropical disturbances scattered will reach Arizona at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then they will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitations will take place around the four corners of the Tuesday country and will last until Wednesday.
Important variations in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes radical change of time on short distances.
The central region of the United States, which rises on Sundays of considerable temperature differences, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, a persistent heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the centre and east of the United States should be familiar with the beginning of October, with temperatures about 26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C] covering the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
The mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Several days' forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than average in the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's process attracts more than 20 million viewers
On 6 television channels Thursday, the arresting hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse is missing, the broadcasting services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a piece of the theatre: an agreement designed by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into charges.
In front of the Senate judicial committee, Christine Ford made sure that 100 per cent of Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had been exposed to attacks on her person and had tried to take off her clothes during a school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionized retreat, also claimed to be some 100 per cent that it had never happened.
According to a report from Nielsen, the process has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching television at the office.
As a comparison, the process has attracted both the world and a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose sponsors widely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most screened during the day of the audit, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC took the second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still following Nielsen.
The interest has never been reduced once the hearing has been completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican had published a communiqué to which it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras launched a scene in which the senator was involved by demonstrators while he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake lowers his eyes for several minutes, while CNN redirects the sequence of direct interpolation.
"Don't look at me anymore, look at me," says one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are demonized."
Before reference was made to the elevator doors, Fleke indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say it more at the Commission's meeting.
All cabled and radio broadcast network channels would cover the meeting directly a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the whole of the Senate.
Fleke points out, however, that a week's investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on allegations made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake left part to convince himself by discussing with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
He takes his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators.
Its choice was heavy in balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual aggression by Brett Kavanaugh.
United Kingdom: May accuse the opposition in Brexit of making the "small political"
In an interview given in Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the kidnappers of his project to leave the European Union, to make the "small political" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May covering, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his plans of Chechers, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "just ridiculous".
Wade Sims: The Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the source of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect of the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU Basctor.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was excommunicated and charged with murder at second grade, indicated Baton Rouge's police service.
The authorities published a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his Mondays during the altercation.
Found on crime sites, the Lunetts carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
During his interrogation, Simpson advised the police to be responsible for Wayne's death.
According to his lawyer, his security was set at $350,000.
The Baton-Rouge parish doctor's office published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death has been caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lived in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the state police medical and legal laboratory, the Southern University police, and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces for their "their commitment and demand for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grows up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, it marked 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach declared that the team was "damaged and under shock" after the news of Wade's death.
"We're going to reduce this kind of event all the time," laments Wade.
Mexico: A Centrifuge Volcano
From the centenary fleeing the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano after having recorded some activity in the crater, with 183 gas and centrifuge emissions at 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images were shown to cover car bridges in Mexican City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in activity at the Volcano level, 72 km from the capital, since a earthquake of 7.1 rocked the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalogue: Police and separatists face-to-faces near the anniversary of the vote for independence
Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following an encounter between independent protesters and the anti-emergency police, while thousands of protesters joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided the Catalonia.
Before being replaced by anti-imposed police, masked separatists threw them out of their eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not satisfy tourists.
Scatters also emerged later in the day, while the police used matrices to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence scandaling 'no forget, no forgive' faced Unionists calling 'long life in Spain'.
14 protesters who had minor injuries were treated according to local press.
One year after the October 1st referendum, which was illegally judged by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans favouring separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
An increasing majority of electors chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opposition to the secession which in most of the boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the voting offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a national police support demonstration.
It was all the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of the independence of the Catholic Church.
"We have been witnesses in the last year for a long time.
My parents were happy to have the idea of voting, but now we're in an impasse," he lamented.
Despite their capital victory, however, in December last year's regional elections, the independent Catalan parties had the wrong to maintain this year, many popular leaders were expelled or detained waiting to be judged to organize the referendum and declared the independence of the Catalonia.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, who films police support on his phone, thinks politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the other hand, as well.
"The tension only makes it up," he lamented.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison in the waiting for a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his application to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"It is for me the best way to declare the regression of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he added.

The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the match 1 to 0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's First Goal ensures Livingston's Victory
Recently mounted, Livingston team surprised the Rangers by putting a second win in 18 matches at Steven Gerard, the current coach of the Ibrox Club.
Menga's goal was to make all the difference and allow Gary Holt's team to be placed in the second position of the classification, equal to Hibernian.
Gerard's men are deprived of victory outside Premiership this season, and they have to face the Hearts team, which runs at 8 points on Sunday.
But first, the Rangers will meet Vienna's Speed on the occasion of the European Union this afternoon.
As for the Livingston team, she has been running 6 matches in her invasive course in the department, and her main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be surprised that she has not lost the least meeting.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face up to embezzled opponents
Holt's team would have been able to move forward well before marking, as their direct approach made the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to guess, but he was stuck in front of the opposite goal; followed by Alan Lithgow's late intervention on Craig Halkett's head pass.
Livingston's team allowed the Rangers to own the balloon, knowing that it could generate them through working tactics.
That's where the decisive objective comes into play.
The Rangers gave a frank break and Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson were allyed to win Menga, who took a touch and entered a goal of the field environment.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impeccable defence, and Liam Kelly's goal guard was only rarely worried.
The second half-time was familiar with the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly's arrest.
The Ranger Guardian Allan McGregor arrested Scott Pittman's attack on his foot, while Lithgow managed to enjoy one of Livingstone's plans.
The Guardian of Livingston defended all his attempts and protected his case, while two punishments were rejected by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of his own hand.
Livingston - Analysis’s “phenomene ”
Alasdair Lamont de la BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and exciting results for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continued to go beyond the expectations of this climber.
Their style and composition of the team have not changed practically since their return to the summit, but the merit is largely returned to Holt to have since its arrival motivated a team
which accounts for many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and magnificently organized, and Menga has held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in haleine throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerard, they were not at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and failed to detect the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which are found in the middle of a table.
The House of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a small breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at improving relations between NATO alliances.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then called for Cologne to open up one of the largest museums.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host it in its country.
The relief of protests reflects this double view of Erdogan: a visit to Hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocracy by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist is killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 1015 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescues arrived on site, but the man was killed at the scene of the accident.
This incident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The car driver had escaped.
The London police said that officials were working hard to identify the individual and prevent its neighbours.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been established. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 wounded agents during a trial
The prison officer for high-security men stated that six prison officers had been injured during an emergency.
The rise began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, at 09h30 local time this Sunday. It is not always under control.
Anti-emergency specialized agents were sent to block the situation, involving 8 prisoners and contained in a prison cell.
On site, agents were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison administration stated: "The staff specially trained were deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their penalties extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-imposed agents were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billard bullets.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden crossings (which could be useful for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is no doubt going to occur at the beginning of next week. Ouragan Rosa is heading towards the desert of the south-west with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by submerged crosses.
The national weather service has already issued alerts for Monday and Tuesday floods for the west of Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should direct herself to Phoenix Tuesday, with rain announcements from Monday night.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the state of depression or tropical storms in a perimeter 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
The Ouragan Katrina (1967) was stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the South-West Desert including the Central Rocheuses and the Great Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for regions affected by drought which are not exposed to sudden risk of cancer.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the region of the south-west, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, at least 40 per cent of Arizona knew at least one extreme drought, the second most serious", reports weather.com.
Ouragan Rosa starts her way on the shores, in the Basse-California Peninsula.
Every day of a great power in the morning and generating winds that can reach up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitations could be massive and risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitations are expected from the Netherlands of California to the north-west of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border tomorrow, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and the South of Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Torrent floods are expected in Basse-California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in the desert of the south-west and are the main threat," explained the National Hurricane Center.
These precipitations are expected to lead to potentially deadly deaths and debriefings in the arid areas, as well as land glimmers in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the charge of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the morning.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset indicated that four young people (age 17, 18 and 20 years old) had been arrested on the night of Radstock.
The agents launched an appeal to people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump declares that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the cruelty and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the impotuous and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been the victim of ill-treatment and the anger of Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke before the Congress yesterday with energy and enthusiasm about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing.
The President said that "the American people have been witness to the intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
"We are in five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I beat myself on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decision-making vote at the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place on Friday, following the statement by a partner from the Republican party to CNN.
Indonesia: Seismo and Tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance does not stop rising
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had been injured, most of whom were carried by huge lavatories that had been attacked on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when the beach was flooded by six metres high. They carried many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitude preceded the tsunami.
"When the Tsunami threat arose yesterday, the whole world was still on the beach. People didn't get away immediately, that cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone. It drove cars, wooden barrels, apartments, it carried everything with it," Nugroho explained, explaining that the tsunami had moved in full sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by rapping trees, adding them.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images published by the disaster management agency show damaged buildings and shops, deformed bridges and bridges, as well as a water-contained mosque.
The replies continued to help the coastal city of Saudi Arabia.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which had a long narrow bay, could have broadened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damages are considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Corps were found trapped under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more important on the 300 km north of Palu, a region called Doghara, the nearest epicenter of earthquake.
The communications have been “completely paralyzed” since Donghaa, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Red in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents said that the waves had arrived at the time the alert was published.
A amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building that suddenly creates a building to pass through the street near a tsunami.
A few minutes later, a water wall was on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with him.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power panel that cut all communications to Palu. It was therefore difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to seek aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been stolen from relief operations, but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: there are more than 800 deaths from tsunami victims.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision of Dothraa staff arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in the shelters located in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered flood scenes, explained Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they've seen many destroyed houses," he explained.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to assist the leftovers, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had no right to travel to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, funds, routings and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it to be a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are always waiting for it."
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, the nearby missing people would expect another miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the caves.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been pregnant for two days, near her mother's body.
The trainer of the Indonesian national team of parapence, Gedon Subbandono, had prepared two of the lost athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Some of his students were found sleeping in the Roa Roa Roa hotel, added Mr. Mandige.
"As an elder in the discipline of the parable, I have lived my own dramas," he explained.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa hotel in the community of the parapet, Mr. Gedon reported that he had suddenly sent news of WhatsApp to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Her messages remained unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, flights are subtilling $26,750 when recharged by an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, they pulled out $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharged an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police service press release.
The driver of the vehicle lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to eat it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leaving places, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact Newport's police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changed his name and became Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now calling Ye.
To announce the new on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A long time ago known as Kanye West."
At 41 years of age, West, who has been called Ye for a while, used this nickname as title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before returning to the issue Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who has canceled his coming for "emotional reasons", explained the author of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this surname also has a religious meaning for the West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you", explained West earlier this year, citing the title of his album with his guest Big Boy.
“ So I am yours, and I am yours.
I've gone from Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye - it reflects good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, also played on union and major schools.
In Mexico, AMLO says he will never resort to military force against civilians.
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost 50 years after the bloody reflections of the forces against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco's place to "never use military force to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China has presented its road map last year: it plans to become the innovation leader IA of 2030.
"Dublining research funds in the IA area would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in IA," says Lee.
Doubleing the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the area of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Sinovation Ventures PDG who invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat Othello's best-classed player. He then joined the Microsoft Research team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
She has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked where the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that approaches university leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on IA.
She added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the United States' efforts in IA.
"I think green cards should be given to researchers in IA," he said.
The State Affairs Council of China has announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence by the new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China grants funding to academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established an Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year for IA research.
At the same time, American legislation which is working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voice at a referendum on the change in their country's name for the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve an old difference between several decades and Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two Governments signed an agreement based on the new name proposed, but nationalists claimed that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Macedonian slave population, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about a minimum 50 per cent participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
According to the parties to the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is the price to pay for bringing together organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for Macedonia's youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in the name would require a majority of the two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13:00.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, while it reached 34 per cent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilized 66 per cent of the voters enrolled after the poll.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote on accession to NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In the Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will take the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO's accession will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investment. The unemployment rate in the country is over 20%.
"I think a large majority will be favorable because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after depositing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would want to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation at 57 per cent.
70 per cent of participants with the intention of voting said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes will need more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first difficult time for the Western Government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, opens a way through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton Defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action of the world for the player.
The Argentinian butter received the balloon in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before swimming on the ground.
Aguero was then locked up by four green maillets.
He was surrounded by a defender before he defeated the others near the target of Brighton.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to transfer the balloon to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton's guard, Matthew Ryan, with a shot from the right side of the file.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, to the journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance that he had marked this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to Skyblues during the First League match,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's territory.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made some hits before she took Sterling to the second floor.
The Skyblues front sent the balloon into the fettos just before it jumped out of the ground.
The city will face Hopeneheim in the Team of Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on the Rhine-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies Troubles
The team of the Nationals was removed from the play-off course, there was no reason to start in a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an end-of-life match for the Rockies, real legends facing Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western League.
The Rockies carried it 5-2 to the Nationals Friday night, but they are always trying to secure their first division title.
"Even if this match doesn't matter, we want to dig the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level than I would have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launching on Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th departure, will be in training Thursday and will start on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington D.C. is 18-7 with an average score of 2,53 and 300 take-offs on 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in Virginia-West
The President welcomed the situation that had generated support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are in five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I beat myself on all fronts for awesome candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this horrible radical group, really horrible, democracy, you see it in work.
And they are determined to regain power by means of all means. See their wickedness.
They depend on whom they hurt, whom they fall to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democracies of people "in anger, malicious and false."
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was worthy of being elected by the public.
“ Do You Remember His Answer? ”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the large community.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When the activists of my local Momentum movement voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered not welcome, all because I have expressed our ideas.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I've been censored because I've been out of line with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe. Ironically, these are issues for which Jeremy himself was in conflict with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting notification said: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of the Friday evening during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party were.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today for many meetings and for the promise of softer and more respected policies, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought to share a political vision began to expect me to return my clothes and take positions against my convictions, whether it concerns national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I spoke publicly, and regardless of what I said, I followed an abuse on social networks, calling for withdrawal, condemning the central policies, saying that I should not be a party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I have more chance than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received were of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disparity of gender or racism every day, but who do not give up their arms.
One of the most decadent things of current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted to the way of the motions of defence and the amendments to the rules of choice.
I've been given a lot of advice these two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not about what I do about politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, because the neglect of the Government of Thatcher had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my differences with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the Friday movement is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters whether they are employees or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of retirement or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are of interest to all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : The rest of the invasive
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt above: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match of the
The team now holds the top ranking and becomes the only invasive team of the champion.
In the end, it is the superiorness of their defense and the way they are taken the opportunities that enabled them to open the score. The coach Peter Murchie can be happy about this match.
"We have been tested so far, but we remain in the wrong, so I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, welcomed Ayr: “Bravo them, they have been more effective than we and they have taken advantage of their opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's test, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish escape Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers. Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed test.
Climo deepened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, first, just in the middle. He marked and transformed a solo test to mount the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started well the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's experiment, transformed by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
A long wait was followed because of a serious injury by Ruarahh Knott, who left the land on a village. During the siege, Ayr returned the fronts with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain at the time of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unconverted experiment by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the team at home got back into hand and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to hit Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of the Air Force, which was moving forward.
Climo transformed the test, almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth test of the team at home.
The Star of Still Game starts in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to run a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old incarnated Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and shared with his long-term partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth show will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of Aposimorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to participate in the "floating restaurant environment" in Glasgow.
"The sea is with us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in a boat blinded in the general district of La Paz.
Public buildings are wooded by a blue cloth like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the marine bases show the following: "The sea returns to us from the right.
Recovery is a duty.’
Throughout the blockade of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to the benefit of Chile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still very present. Like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades. Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be held on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and looks forward to a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will address the Bolivian application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will have to negotiate a sovereign passage to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia (who faces a struggle for the reelection next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there are few opportunities for the court to speak in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations tribunal based on the Netherlands has no authority to grant a Chilean territory, and it has provided that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", explained Paz Zárate, an international expert in law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have affected her.
"The problem of sea access has been reversed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The Belgian rhetoric of Morales knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but then it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was abnormal.
Monday will give Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end up to 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bee.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to make a difference from the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country would not stand for its nuclear weapons until it would trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
It was expressed at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the point of relaunching a nuclear diplomacy within more than three months of Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, currently head of North Korea.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that the United States' maintenance of sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will lead to the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant pre-arranged disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, Pyongyang's seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is the debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion gap reveals the latest trends in coverage, perhaps next available in your shops.
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun by 100%, do not look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversized hats at a PE19 challenge that showed respect for the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, some of the most extraordinary hats that others have invaded Instagram, and the Creators have decided to integrate their delicate parts into the disfigures.
The part of Valentino's hair was an eccentric beige decorated with a large board of leather, which included the head of the mannequins.
The other oversize accessories included paired pastries of bees, a cup of cheese and even ananas. But these parts have not been imagined to keep you warm.
Tom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the haircuts and were more than Hannibal Lecter than the High-Courture.
One creature was like a plong equipment, with tubes and moonlights, while another was thinking about a deep ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you have a chance.
According to the style observers, cape taxors could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the "Bomba" seal, the wide-band pallet hat that the stars are pulling, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this hard portable hat that has exposed the social networks presented another of its creations on the podium: a beach bag of sand almost as large as the mangüyn in a bathroom that carried it.
The burnt orange bag, decorated with raffles and a white leather ring, was the master's part of the PE19 defiel La Rivera de Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the next summer's shops. The Creator has so noted the spirits that it is clear that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent results from a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a school programme, we note that contemporary languages remain popular and desired materials in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot support English for building relationships and establishing a reliable link with the inhabitants of other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, it is found that languages are high in classification, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A, in mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied Germany, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Currently, languages as materials are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 revealed that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to skills in insufficient languages.
Language skills are thus increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of his choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
You can communicate directly with strangers and will automatically place the Multilingual Person before your competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to have a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in learning languages is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a decent job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach important languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Ecosey independent schools want to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It is clear that, at present, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of major importance for the country's future. This must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The watch is almost over for fans looking for LeBron James's beginnings at the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, the coach of Lakers, announced that James would play on Sunday, at the opening of the pre-session, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell doubted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier this week, James was asked for his pre-session projects, which included six matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-session matches to be ready."
Trump campaign in West Virginia (Cayéye YouTube)
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote of confirmation of the vacancy to the Supreme Court is being reported, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to avoid that the Republicans lose control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time did Trump meet in Virginia-West tonight and how did he look online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, in West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 a.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, directly on YouTube.
Trump should address the issue of the hearings of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week, and Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in Senate should be reported up to one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims firstly to help the Republicans win the country for November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and participants while the Republicans were trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"The control of Congress is such an essential element of its programme that the President will become the largest number of States possible at the beginning of this electoral campaign," said Reuters a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media".
Saturday, this will be the second trip in a month from Trump to Virginia-West, a State that won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the Virginia-West Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to relaunch him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep its hope close to Sunday's simples
After three simple days, Saturday afternoons after noon could well represent what he lacked in this Ryder Cup.
The movement of the flag is a sport concept invented from all parts but which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
So where would they be now?
"They held with six points of advance and now four, so it gives us some wings," Jordan Spieth said while he repeated for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points of advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little bit of wind in the hole and have all the reasons to be encouraged, including by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and may have taken every three points on four.
Spieth has shown itself to be extremely effective of tea in green and is an example.
The energy joy crises intensified as his game progressed. A crucial hole allowed him to balance the fourth part while Thomas and he were led down two after two holes.
His ass, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th floor, raised a similar cry from those who tell you he always believes in the American team.
"He really needs to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all there is to each of these players right now.
18 trolls to start.
The only players to have scored more than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup's story shows.
The strange but devout European couple won four matches and did not have the right to the wrong.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones to realize not only a crazy Saturday afternoon after noon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine Friday mornings.
This series, the way their energy seems to circle between them and the crowd to dedelegate them as players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to save a European winning potential while the sun falls on the National Golf.
In preference, both are at the same time as different three.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, morning's four-ball hero, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine times sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never get out.
On the other hand, the Sunday is not there to help you.
The furballs and fursoms are so fascinating to observe due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and those they do not give, and how a strategy can fall into a blind eye.
Europe has played better on the team so far and has taken considerable progress during the last few days, but this exercise has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, particularly in the country.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States in Saturday’s football and matches.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two winners on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to mark four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning’s football matches in front of an American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the arms and has won two victories, but they have failed to rescind the gap.
Jim Furyk's men have to unmistakably tear eight points on 12 Sundays in simple ways to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to unveil four points, while Molinari and him, named "Mollwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's story to get four points in their first four matches.
After breaking down Woods and Patrick Reed in the field of furballs, they beat the pair composed of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already bonded by 5 and 4 more categories.
Woods, who had been trained during the two Saturday matches, has flashed at a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 football and soccer matches, and seven affiliates.
Justin Rose, well placed for the morning football team, joined Henrik Stenson in the matches, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-western part of Paris, under a cold but detached time.
The winning triples Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans by marking two Saturday points.
They won a well deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Furballs and once again beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in the Fursoms, who lost the first two.
Two times only in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had nothing to do with saving its trophies.
After having been second for two days, however, they may not return from an attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be "in no case" unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken the last year of "important measures of good will", such as ending nuclear and missile tests, demilitarizing nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he lamented
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we are afraid of our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves."
While reiterating the well-known claims of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "by step" approach to the denuclearization that would have been rewarded by North Korea if it had taken progressive measures, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore during the first summit between an American executive president and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed himself to working for a "declination of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected requests for severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and reinforces pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even contrary to the "declaration of the end of war".
“ Those who think that these sanctions can make us cry don’t know us.
The problem is that keeping sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri has made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump in force before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean Director Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If South Korea and not the United States were the party concerned, the Korean peninsula would not be in such a state. "
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of the last year when it was announced to the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable to place North Korea's missions on the North American territory after President Trump qualified Kim of "missile" on his suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the last year before the United Nations to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not commend this year for the courage that Kim applied for disarmament measures, but added that there was still much to be done and that the sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea would not disarmament.
Wednesday, Trump said that no time had been set. "It may take two years, three or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council stated: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verifiable declination."
The Security Council has consistently strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to increase the financing of the nuclear programmes and ballistic missions in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri next to the General Assembly of the United Nations and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already made three trips to North Korea, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea had declared its "Gangster Methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to launching a mission site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all students of the first cycle to sleep more and to fight the growing machinist trend, which is to study caffeine consumption all night.
A professor noted that most students of the world's best university don't know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first kind in the United States.
It is after having given a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea has come to him.
Finally, a student approached me and said, "Why have I been told this only in recent years?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she confided in The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits in order to improve their school and physical performance as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were suffering from a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee, rail, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the field containing interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behavior.
However, we think they have the right to know this information - the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of tobacco on health," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride to "pass through a white night" is always there, and it adds that modern technology and constant pressure on students make a growing problem of sleeplessness.
The fact that there is enough sleep and good quality should be "the secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in a way of initation, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and forced him to insist on being offered to all the camps.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all students of the third cycle to follow a similar study programme before joining the above-mentioned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students prepare an alarm both for the time of sleep and for the wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disturb their circular rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal is to shoot Gerrard's men
The Rangers took a new hard strike outside, and Dolly Menga's attack led by Steven Gerard's disarmed team to Livingston's default of 1-0.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first move victory since his triumph 4-1 in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team influenced Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches as coach, leaving his team behind, eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the mid-term and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to balance.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston is in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the judge Calum Spence who had to be treated for a headache following the death of an object from the opposite side.
Gerarrd made eight changes in the team, which took Ayr to the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for him, chose the same Livi 11 that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been thrilled to see his well-trained team beat its opponents on each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have been marked in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman for Allan McGregor's purpose, but the ground environment left its chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-definator Alan Lithgow could only reach the second floor
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have benefited from a penalty after the Frank cut when Steven Lawless and he was taken into exile, but the judge Steven Thomson distinguished the Colombian applications.
The Rangers had only prophesied two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was in pain troubled by Lassana Coulibary and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was against the game course, nothing could possibly deserve it by their work found.
Once again, the Rangers have failed to face Jacobs' arrest warrant.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-free to choose Menga for a very simple end.
Gerard responded to the mid-term by replacing Coulibally by Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the ally appeared before Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has still encouraged visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long ball on long ball.
Holt's team would have been able to take advantage of it in the last few moments, but McGregor was very disappointed in relieving Jacobs before Lithgow passed the goal.
The Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in jail with Jacobs, but Thomson has again ignored it.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now, a page from our German "Sunday Morning" : On September 30, 1882, it was 136 years ago today, and TOURNE... was born by future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that has subsequently given birth to the device known as Geiger's computer.
Since then, the Geiger account has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950's "Bels of Coronado" film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger accountant, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, we can really hear the effects of atoms released in the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans said, "So it's safe here!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new anti-cancer vaccine allows the immune system to decelerate cancer cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine allows the immune system to decelerate cancer cells and kill them
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "declare" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim was to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "increaseses a number of types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has given evidence in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
A MAGA casket couffet, Kanye West launched in a Pro-Trump diaribe after passing to SNL.
That didn't happen well.
Kanye West was sitting on the platform after a dedicated performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to attend the 2020 elections.
After his third dance, Ghost Town, he sang by wearing a Mace America Great Again, West took them to the Democrats and reiterated his support in Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism was bothering me, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue was launched by Matt Damon's sketch in which the Hollywood video appeared from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on allegations of sexual aggression by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been disseminated, the registration of the West diaspora has been related to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to fuck West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the hills because of his castle.
“ They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a gouffre," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gooffrey?" and says he would wear his superman hat because no one can tell him his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him at least twice by the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One on-site person in the magazine said: "A silence of death has fallen across the board."
West had been called to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former little friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disappointed many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West receives the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "In one of the most courageous souls: WELCOME TO BE TOLD IN THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the show's animator, questioned that West was just "faithful to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, I think, adopts and defeats an evil ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so have we," she added.
Before the issue, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and certainly the legend fire Prince, who changed his name in symbol, then the artist's first known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the video of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his final role in the game of Thrones, HBO's fantastic media series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often attracts young boys to take care of themselves.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something's wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Game of Thrones covette, warned that he was “hardly” to deal with this issue.
“ Personally, I think we have abused masculinity. ”
"What lessons have we learned from young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that is now facing them?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male personality.
He continued: "What behavior is wrong, what behavior has been involved?
What is it that television and the street learns from young boys who try to think that they must behave like this to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is any evidence, something that sounds.’
In the interview, he also warned that he would not do prologs or follow-up when the show ended next summer, claiming that he had finished with "the fields of battle and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be the viewer of a rehearsal from True West, from Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor discovered that meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I have met my wife in this series, so she has offered me my future family and my precious life," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygrite, the lover of Kit's personality, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were contaminated by sexual reports, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has been practically reduced to zero, as stated by the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
However, from one year to another, the number of HIV positive and infected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual reports is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was delineated in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remained very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
In its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters claims that an employee of the GOP has disclosed data on senators, and claims "dangerous lies" and "computer theories".
On Saturday, US Republican Maxine Waters announced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information on three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and websites "of extreme right".
"False lies, lies, and other false information" responded Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of the United States senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown member at Chapter Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual aggression against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The flight took place some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a member of Waters staff.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false. ”
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and false allegations, is not responsible for the escape of such information."
“ This false claim is completely false and a true lie. ”
The Waters statement quickly prompted online criticism, including by Ari Fleischer, the former press attacker of the House-Blanche.
"This is anger," he wrote.
"This means that she does not have the time necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She mustn't be a provocation.
It must not give rise to the reasons of the defendant.
It must remain calm and serene. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Democrats about Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters at the mid-mandate elections, also made his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the application of the relevant laws" concerning these false claims.
"We will ensure that the prisoners are disarmed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English is still hit. Rowan Atkinson's parody, second-hand spy
It has now become a tradition to look into Brexit's scope in any new British film, and it seems to apply to this repetition of Johnny English's action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and restored its surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
The ironic auto-satere on the issue of the evidence of our insignia would it be the new export chance of our country?
In all cases, incompetence Johnny English, with his eyes closed and his face covered, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates first of all that it is a great chemical creation designed for a non-englophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charmer, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that runs a small note in The Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Initially, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson sometimes played in the television advertisements Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving behind the chaos.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathical moments.
I liked Johnny English as he was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medium arm and that the rotor's wings were briefly hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is valued, although the Humour is rather insufficient and extremely superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licences like 007 and Mission are impossible to make up for themselves in any confidence with the comedy.
Humanism seems to be more directed towards children than adults and, to me, Johnny English's colourless adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's death movie gags in Bean's personality.
The ever-present assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British spy supersecret web network, exposing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great development of service agents - a low-level hero role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the taste that draws up the vessel for a prime minister who is a pumping person on the side of the crisis and who is already suffering from a political population: Emma Thompson is giving her best with this person almost-Teresa-May, but there is no great cause to be put under her teeth in the scenario.
Its information advisers should inform each active spy that has been committed, and should make one of them withdraw.
This means that Johnny English has to arrange for himself, who is now employed in a small facility as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons about how to become a secret agent: some nice things are done here, because English offers a rock Academy spying academy.
English is brought to Whitehall for a meeting of emergency information and finds Bough, his former long-time partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey battalion role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a gaspled.
So Batman and Robin, who create great damage to His Majesty's secret services, are committed to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling under the technology billions of charismatics that are said to be capable of solving the information problems of Great Britain: left-wing Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their oyssette of colorful beads: under the wear of servers, they set fire to an exciting French restaurant; they create a chaos by fading on Volta's luxurious villa; and English discovers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality box, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All arrests are guaranteed for this last sequence, but despite all, there is nothing wrong with children in all of this.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn't stop thinking, like other Johnny English films: can't the British cinema industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party has not developed a plan so that the British can work for four days but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has to consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
The party appears to want the heads of the company to benefit the economic workers generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of retirement.
This would allow employees to benefit from a three-day weekend, while continuing to touch the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the Party's economic programme and plans to guide the country for workers.
The four-day transition was approved by the union convention as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated at Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that will coincide with the approach of the party to rebalance the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was engaged in a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party stated: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by it."
The additional Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the last week's workshop to provide details on his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power at the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "profiters" in public utility companies.
The additional wastewater plans also provide that current water companies shareholders may not recover the total amount of their disposal as the labour market government could operate "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan for the integration of workers into business management councils as well as the creation of an inclusive fund of shareholders which will pay 10% of private companies' capital to employees, which will amount to up to 500 € of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their opinion.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was reported at least one week after the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's conclusions could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the program "60 Minutes", asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
It was resolved, determined, without fault."
However, Graham's vote seems to be in the rock.
"I have taken my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there should be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett did it categorically," adds Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I find nothing new to change.’
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive panoramic star and investment in an even more impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's Great Law in order to benefit not only from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise the population to the real goal of the festival, namely ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers should carry out a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary e-mailing a global leader, telephone or other useful efforts to raise awareness of the population against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still reach its goal in the remaining 12 years?
The idea of rewarding people by a free concert really enables them to insist on calling for action, or is it just another example of "clictivism" - a situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its participants, who complain about many different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to take commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been withdrawn or raised.
The group estimates that the guarantee funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who are committed to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda 35 million Sterling books to end malnutrition in this country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a note of the social injustice of malnutrition in history," said the people of Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions to request the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in food interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen stated: “The way to arrive there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
However, like the major civil rights defence and anti-parity movements before us, we will arrive because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is one of the artists who will be present this year in New York, where Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the sea to create a "block" to enter Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" call the U.S. Marine, revealed Ryan Zinke, the American Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - in particular where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a prerequisite that allows it to explore new energy markets.
"I think they're in the Middle East to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the South European centre," he would say.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States, with our Marine, can ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, obstruct their energy from being placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the U.S. energy consumer portal.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are really identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option lies more or less in the operation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one cord on its back" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamizing its exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do so, representatives of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to leave the "unappropriate" project of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prison" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of slow competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has led to negative reactions by Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to take part in European energy policy or bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the 2020 presidential elections, declare the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-mandate elections.
At a public conference in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would like to present herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the summit," she says, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider submitting my application to the Presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying that he "led this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren showed himself frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate to the Supreme Court of that one, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a Jewish survey showed that most of Warren's voters are not of opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58 per cent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the many other names of Democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision this January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after she was around September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently trying, what he feels is coming in, I can link him to other families who are experiencing the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are experiencing," she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin qualified his arrest of "taboo subject" and said about his son and other former combatants that "they return a little different, strengthened, asking whether they were respecting what their friends and members of the air forces, and each other's military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police service in Wasilla, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with sexual aggression and violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of an arms in terms of fertility.
18 Columbia State and District are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the Colombian district are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum to victims by fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, the representatives of 18 States and districts filed a memorandum for an asylum seeker who was responding to this policy, stated NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The State prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing generalized problems of gangs and marital violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed the clandestine immigrants to flee from marital violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Colombia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy " ignores the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law provides that all asylum applications must be examined in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curious friend.
Lawyers have also supported the memory that the policy of non-refoulement of immigrants at night in the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary work".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims of sexual violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of political responsibility.
"The asylum has never been designed to address all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race for survival
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tired," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her little black boy in Palu, in an evacuation center of the village.
“ At every moment, a ramen ambulance of the body.
The clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting stolen goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 were injured.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the two and the shoulders, were placed in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated abroad because of persistent relapses.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent seismo that had hidden the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was broken into the ruins of the wall, I believe," entrusted Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accused China of "intimidation" through "propagandistic advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page publicity on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump recently mentioned the supplement paid by China Daily in the Mines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to get involved in the American parliamentary elections on November 6, a charge that China rejects.
In accusing Pekin of wanting to take part in the American elections, Trump noted that US officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments are willing to place advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralleled by a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
In the beginning of the commercial war, Chinese tariff measures aimed at attacking State exporters such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Pékin had done harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "is in the process of doubleing its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of press by inserting a payout advertising in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, in Beijing's press guise, you will find few conflicting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the Chinese economic trajectory, as the media strictly obey the Chinese Communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying so much about it.
Analysts warn that the Republicans align electricity with the mid-mandate elections due to Kavanaugh's defeat
While many high-level republics defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual aggression, analysts warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the next mid-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely alive, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on 29 September in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said that "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute's efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favour of an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief national adviser and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said last September 28th according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reported, the protesters sang "The month of November!" in the colors of the Senate while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee decided to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be eliminated," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst.
"People claim it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the electricity of the bathrooms and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public deposition explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the name of the Supreme Court, analysts believed that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans had advanced confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of the last week that "It has become a confusion for the GOP".
"It is not only the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans handled the situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States' priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats in the television journal.
Following Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, however, the Americans seem divided on the credibility of the two parties, a small majority thinking on the other side.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41 per cent of the people surveyed believed in Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 per cent declared that they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that Kavanaugh had probably lied or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations advanced by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Blake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate judicial committee that she had been raped by Kavanaugh while she was pregnant at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a new company that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes part in the Berners-Lee Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored as well as persons authorised to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that Inrupt intended to "dominate the world".
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own online personal data store or DPL.
It can include contact lists, job lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to company GDP, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, of some developers working on the project and of a voluntary coder community.
This week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he is not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not there is a complete change where all of their business models are completely camouflaged.
“ We don’t ask them for permission. ”
In an article on Media, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with a view to protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.

"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," adds Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an Ecclesiastic of the First World War Decorated Cross of Victoria
The only ecclesiastical Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, when he was attacked in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Her two small children were excavated by a monumental stone at a stand in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his little sons, said that he was "symbolically brilliant" to release the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's operation.
According to London Gazate, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battle on the St. Quentin Canal "through a very fierce and violent roulard of campaign and military cannons."
Later, he stepped on the shooting line and, with the "greatest braver", led the line before he jumped a cannon of camp to him all alone and took three soldiers from the landing.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter shot Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing at the height of which I would never be, but which makes me humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the defeat led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann believed that he felt "very honored to be part of the cause" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
The mixed martial arts fans have been awakened all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night looking at a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event consisted of 13 battles, six on the main board, and was broadcast directly all night to the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the United Kingdom's televisions were sealed when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some of us were happy to stay awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to an animated design for children as “a kind of bad joke. ”
With regard to the transmission, the vice-president-general of the marketing and communication at Bellator Dave Schwartz stated that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m. this content was not suitable, so they had to go back to children's emissions".
"Peppa the Pig," yes. "
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said they were going to work on their programming to include future British viewers.
“ I think that when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution, ” Coker said.
“ However, it is six o’clock in the morning one Sunday, and we will not find a solution before our Sunday, or Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program collapsed, there were many messages in both ways and they were not all friends.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We're going to limit ourselves to five battles instead of six -- as we do usual -- and we've tried to give more for fans and we've got everything.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" on the plan of sexuality
The Olympic Plaintiff Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he had done nothing before going to high school but "the whole world wasn't like me".
Under the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presentation by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "the hope".
He also said that the fact of becoming a parent made her less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual emission presenter, Kirsty Young, has been retired for several months because of his illness.
As a ship wrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley believed that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls".
He stated: “Today, these feelings of inferiority and differentness are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success. ”
In order not to discover the whole world when they finally learned the truth about her sexuality, he wanted to prove that she was "something," he continued.
The double medald Olympic bronze is now a well-known LGBT soldier and has benefited from his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to request a larger number of countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt capable of being able to live openly without having any ramifications and that he wanted to “hope” others.
The world's triple champion said that he "did not wait" for a man's love fall - American movie star Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old college last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When one lives so much at a young age," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same high and low.
In June they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I thought I'd just get a gold medal," he explained.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley was convinced that his father had not agreed that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you're no longer here to be in the first row," he said.
"I hold him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it was necessary that he stopped breathing and that he died so that I might finally admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all that I had dreamed of all my life - wandering in front of a crowd at home during the Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him his first choice of song - Proud de Heather Small - who accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of the chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11 a.m. 15, BST.
A Mikkelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to go back to avoid it being a bad step.
Mickelson, who participated in the Biennial Competition for the twelfth time, a record, was separated by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's football and matches.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five major champion has shared his day between the role of supporting and strengthening his game in order to heal his muscles.
He has never been the greatest of men, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically imposes the cuts.
And as if the race wasn't short enough in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth game on Sunday, faced Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who made this week team with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at the start of the 12 simple games, take a good start, the game of Mikkelson could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he was playing today, gave me a second key, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and it's added both things to these teams in the past, as well as this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected more, but it's like what happened and it's like what we thought we had to do.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson captures Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of meetings of the disputed Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup which has never actually reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 weaknesses and seven deminers, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to smile at people, and it's kind of awesome to have in the team room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed measuring with him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play.’
European Election Captain Thomas Björn knows that progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that a non-fashionable advance before the last few days of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a criminal course.
The Danois discussed his first match in 1997 in Valderama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five front points on the Americans, but finally stood in the head of the classification with the smallest possible difference on the line of arrival, bearing 1411⁄2-13121⁄2.
"You will not stop to remember that we are going to Valderram widely; we had a great progress in Brooklyn, where we have failed, and in Valderram, where we have won, but in justice," said Bjrn, after observing the 2018 Class won the 5-3 victory on Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to take 10-6.
The story will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything you need.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this battle, and above all, we must remain focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - these are the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performances of her players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never progress on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a different pair of weaknesses.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and will go anywhere else.
It's great to be with a co-equipped when things go well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to pass to players, it's to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When his partner is left behind, he has to take the best out of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as co-equipators, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points on four.
Furyk himself knew the two extremes of these last days, after he became part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing the victory of the "Miracle de Médinah", where Europe gained victory.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, had done to rally his players the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this move as soon as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the environment's matches.
We have established our training and put the boys as we think we should do, we are trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas saw the task of taking the attack and facing Rory McIllroy in the middle of the first class, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the class.
"I have accompanied this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjrn said on his simple selections.
The new German warship still reported
According to local media, the new German Navy fleet should have been put into service in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war, but it will not be in service until the next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditure.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the establishment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the Arab ship of all the new frigates of Bade-Wurtenberg, was reported in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Marine in 2014, but the concerns arising after delivery have compromised the purpose of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old-fashioned frigates of the Brüme class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-ships missiles, as well as certain foreign technologies, such as a low radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest brakes for a period of two years outside the port of attack.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that pre-warguardships - which should allow Germany to design its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
In the last year, the F125 frigate has made major headlines when the German Navy officially refused to service the ship and sent it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were unknown, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship useless in the case of deployment in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important because Bade-Wurtemberg ships will be operated by a crew consisting of about 120 marines, which corresponds to half of the crews of Bremen's old frigates.
In addition, the ship seems to be considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the capacity of the Marine to bring about future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" weigh twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the shortcomings of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared with 2.2 billion at the start.
The problems related to new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent alerts that the German Naval Force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, recognized earlier this year that the Marine is actually "in short of ships capable of operating".
The manager stated that the situation had had a bad effect with time, since the old ships had been landed but no replacement ship had been designated.
He regrettably that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg's frigates were able to join the Marine.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of Souri Keys
New research carried out in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how the souri keys use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and sopranos pipelines as well as long-sound brown-sourish keys and Daubington in Inverwe's garden, Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key areas around the property to monitor the activities of mouse keys throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of noise key crises as well as the activities of different species.
A map and a report on housing will be prepared to draw up a detailed table of behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for the souri keys and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of dams and the best way to preserve forests for droughts and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, there has been a significant decline in the number of key populations in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the pests and leads to their loss of habitat.
Eolines and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as the killings of mice and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as the attacks of company chats.
Mouse keys are not really blind.
However, given their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching drafts.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, NTS takes the raw keys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, survey inspections and sometimes rescue inspections.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland's souri keys on the Thave site in Dumfries-et-Gallway, which opens eight of the ten species of Scotland's souri keys.
David Thompson, the management of the area, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for the souri keys," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good housing.
But there is still much to learn about the souri keys, although the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what souri keys need to make progress."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of raw keys prior to the maintenance of property, since without the need for a single motherhood nest, it could result in the death of 400 women and small children, to the disappearance of any local population.
Souri keys are protected and it is illegal to kill them, tear them down, or destroy their pets.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Ecosais responsible for Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide its assistance.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our souri keys and about a lot of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for the moment."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo qualified for the charges of “false information ” against him and said that people “are interested in getting to know one another ” by using his name.
Her lawyers are going to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and the Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid 375 000 dollars to keep her silent about this incident, stated Der Spiegel vendredi last.
With regard to its 142 million fans in a video published directly on Instagram, a few hours after the release of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has classified these information as "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera's five-year-old Ballon d'Or.
"They want to make themselves of the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are inclined to continue with Der Spiegel on these allegations, which have qualified as "an unacceptable claim of suspicion in the field of private life".
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player would ask for compensation for "morrow damages of a proportion of the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the person's rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the casino hotel in Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga were apparently returned to the player's room, where an annal violence would occur, according to documents deposited at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga says that Ronaldo was jealous after the alleged incident and assured him that he was "good-bye" to "99%" but that he didn't know what was going on with "1%" the rest.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations but that they had consented.
Majorga also claimed to have returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently adopted a friendly rule because she felt "terrified by repressives" and was afraid of "a public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to annul this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian Giant Juve in a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the State Secretary for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if she had lost her world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "injurious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory, near Derby, if Britain had withdrawn from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit could cost jobs.
Burnaston - which manufactures Auris and Aventis vehicles in Toyota - has built nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini store in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The greatest concern is that car manufacturers are at risk for Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "twenty stream" parts reach all 37 minutes of United Kingdom and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured on-board.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there may be border disturbances which, according to industry, could lead to delays and damages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory for more than one day at his Derbyshire factory, declared the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will, as I have said, not only benefit from the current success but also take this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today issue.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other builders, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become an excellent set of supply channels."
If Toyota had not been able to determine how long production would be stopped, however, she warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and would end by costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United trade union and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were more concerned: "My experience is that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The House-Blanche announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, could be "repatriated for a week" while the struggle for candidate to the Supreme Court continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Energence in Elections, the links between Trump and Russia's collaborators and the possible obstacles to the justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether Trump will return or not to the Deputy Attorney General, and therefore endangers Mueller's independence, feeding the ruminants in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about bringing a micro to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't have these allegations.
Last Monday, however, he presented himself to the White House while he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump stated that he "would not rather not" refer to Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was reported to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee that had witnessed Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, still late for the Senate vote.
Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one week's rest being given everything else that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll be there and I like to have the press in the current."
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has had no press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an advert for the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing to do with the fact that they spread the gallery."
Then she let me know that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without reference to evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-response sessions than any other President before him": "We checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but "If the press is able to question the President of the United States directly, it is far better to talk to me.
We often try to do this, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and this will take place at a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a detoured appearance and at the moment, a strange appearance before the journalists assembled.
With regard to fear of Brexit, the Secretary for Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to remain in post post post-Brexit.
The Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of state applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, the retirement negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should result in decisions to this end.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations in the absence of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate to what extent I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, whatever his nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a headache, Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, second-class of the Tigers of Tennessee, was suddenly operated after a headache on Saturday at the loss of Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the trainer of the state of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
"He arrived on the touch line and ran there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a civilian and carrying it through another examination.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was from the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris pointed out that there had been “no more precise information about the type or extent of injury” and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five posters on the whole Saturday before leaving the match, which took him all out of the season to 18 posters.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy an estate in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless in the new conservation regimes
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign carried out by Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in the duty of stamp will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasure is expected to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year to help the unopened.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy an estate in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target people with high income.
The increase in stamp rights will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will help strengthen government efforts in the fight against unemployment.
This surtax - which has just been added to the current Timber Act, including the higher levels installed two years ago on secondary residences and acquisitions - could reach 3%.
The treasurer expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13% of the new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which reduces prices and prevents arrivals from taking place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in capital - have become "farm cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers living most of their time outside the country.
This new policy takes weeks to punish after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in the law of stamps in order to help more young people acquire a first house.
In accusing large construction companies of maintaining real estate prices at a high level by acquiring land without using them, she invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "immobilial grace" that is located in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rentals and the elimination of “unfailure” expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils more extensive powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "In the last year, I stated that I would devote my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is also easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become far away and the poverty of the homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish electorate at a given time.
The 42-year-old Ecossais is pleased to see the challenge of re-establishing the North-East Club, which is currently the third location of League 1, to three points of leadership.
He picked up the Stadium of Light this summer after he took St. Mirren to Premier League in Scotland last season.
“ I used to play for my country as a player.
I've been selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would, however, be presented only if I succeed in the club's management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland voters are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician said he did not hesitate to run behind such emblematic names in such a large club, already delineating the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club to First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think of myself as a success here only if I could bring the club down there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in the training of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to rebuild a delegation in the third division and transformed St. Mirren, who was on the board of the delegation, into a great winner of the championship next season.
Ross says more about himself now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's charge "was no doubt a real carrefour", he recalls.
"I really found that being a coach would be better than playing.
This seems strange because I'm well out there, that I've earned my life well, and that I've benefited from some valuable summits.
But sometimes it's hard to play.
There's a lot of details to fix every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach will be very good.
I have always wanted to drive and now I do it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my adult life."

The summer canal has made British pubs' incomes hard, but has caused pressure on restaurant channels.
The figures indicate that bars and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Board, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent isolation and longer participation of England in the World Cup made it possible that the month of July followed the model of June, where bars had an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had a more important shock.
The reduction of 1,8 % registered in June in the restoration sector has only occurred in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are far more vogue, with more similar points than the restaurants that lower them.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and get a glass.
In pubs and bars, sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food decreased by 3 per cent. "
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst at the RSM hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
Meteo and the impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is no wonder that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, regardless of the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum is particularly painful, in addition to constant cost pressures.
The length and temperature could not have been less suitable for the food sector operators and the time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we knew in August would give us a good review."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowdown in the installation.
The industry's sales are monitored by the Peach Tracker Caffer for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion Sterling books and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child of five has secret accounts that he or she is hiding from his parents.
According to a survey, a five-year-old - some of whom are only 11 years old - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "main" account to show them to their parents
A five-year-old - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens an account on the social media he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth of the "Insta false accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of the students said to manage a net "main" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A 13 - year - old mother who fell by the hand on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site found out a teenager who encouraged others to “violent me. ”
According to a study conducted by Digital Awareneness UK and the Headmasters and HeadMistresses Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of those who recognize their private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Island Doyle will represent the athletes to the Scottish Athletics Board of Administration.
Sheilh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Management Board as non-executive director at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most exotic athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of his vast experience gained at the international level these ten years.
"It benefits greatly from respect within the Scottish, British and World Athletes community and we are sure that Scotland's Athletics would greatly benefit from its participation in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and lead this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre tests at Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 where he won four gold medals and now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transitional ischemist attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would come back or at what point.
It was a hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Online, an advertising about the milk which compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a shot could compare mothers with cows during the treatment.
In order to mark the launch of what is known as "the first silent drawing in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, launched an adage inspired by a music video clip to show the freedom that her new drawings offered to attractive women.
In a cornfield full of cows, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song that says: "Yes, I betrayed myself, but you don't see any noise" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my heart, not mothers."
The Refrigerator continues: "Push it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help women bring milk."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has aroused a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must fall in pain and give birth to milk, unless their babies are taken away from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's milk is carefully adapted to a large relief support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable traumatism for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to make a baby's advertising for mothers who keep their babies?"
One of them added: "An advertising is so off-line."
Others defended advertising, for example, by a woman who admitted that she found the "silarant" song.
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I'd have bought one if I was still in the alley.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
The advertising is a little bit of money, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's an amusing advertising for mothers who take their milk (often at their place of work or toilets) and feel like "empty".
This is not a publicity that celebrates the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced with the sharp-lett discrepancy reflected in their support.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use abortion say they have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie's milk is completely silent, with no children or eggs and is discreetly inserted into an alley support, which gives women the freedom to move, to have their babies, and even to go out all the way out of their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother, commented: "The Elvie extract is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an audibly and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a pleasant and faithful way the incredible sense of freedom that this new bring about.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is making one of the newspapers.
During the week of the fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants were settled quietly in a camp at the border of Texas.
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably since the number of monthly crossings at the border has remained relatively stable, partly because of the serious statements and policies of the Trump administration in order to make children’s placements difficult for respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were immigrants themselves without papers and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by bringing up a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their digital impressions and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for training from unaccompanied minors.
The Agency therefore confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested did not have judicial precedents.
"At least 80% of people who are respondents or members of their families are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr. Albence.
According to refugees, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities set up new rules that would impose some of them to compare before the court within the month following their detention rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconference rather than by person to complain about their legal status before a judge of immigration.
Unelected persons will soon be expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted in recent months by the refugee network, more children remain in detention, more likely to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to acts of violence or flight attempts.
In a large facility such as Tornillo, these concerns are overemphasized by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that the movement of children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have to deal with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw from it.
In an address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moulalem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were on the Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would “have been treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem argued that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 3660,000 people have been killed since 2011 and that millions of others have been dragged from their homes.
He said that Damascus was going to continue "to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" both by both terrorist groups and by any "unlawful foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which form and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war - torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers.
Moulalem said about refugees, the conditions were favourable to their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "proclaiming irrational concerns" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to make such return easier," he said.
"They are in the process of politicalizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union knew that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war would not be concluded.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel Idlib has enabled political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turc agreement has avoided a large-scale invasion of the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moulalem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for "specific times" and hoped that the military measures would target the Djihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee gathering government members and opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moulalem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and formulated a safeguard against any interference.
Why Trump Wins a Second Command
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be real in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers undoubtedly expect, destruction and scandal lead him to leave his presidency early.
What would undoubtedly be "The most spectacular end of a presidency!"
At this point, the public does not show any sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, rates at point hours have doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's something that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, a representative of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor" which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Chapter.
In Scovell, a famous comic book author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some unrefutable truths about the fact of moving into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory for him.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask you?
"He answered: 'Because he laughs at me'," said Ms. Scovell.
The chaos has a funny value.
Of course, contrary to what is happening on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe c. Wade case if immigrant families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the luckiest viewers can afford.
However, this goes beyond being a informed citizen when a six-hour panel of experts discussed how Bob Woodward was used as a "deep know-fire" for his book "Fair", on Paul Manafort's leather leather suit at $15,000 (“a full of pride” according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I will never see Super Mario again.
"If a part of what he does is impressed to see a TV show, it's because he's doing something to you every night," said Brent Montgomery, director general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars" on the changing teams and daily situation returns of Trump (to fight with NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees in his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he was going inside to look at MSNBC while registering CNN.
He could not stand up, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court in play.
"I remember the time when we celebrated all these crazy emissions and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," I was told by Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

The money from the outside covers the most closed mid-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was inundated with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the congresses that allowed two owners to discuss the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh Bay, which has recently been rebuilt, is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has announced his seat in another circuit during the recent special elections.
Lamb stands for another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly serves the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established in January that the former rounds were constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th district course has resulted in an end to a confrontation on the financing of electoral campaigns between the major funding branches of the parties, the Committee of the Congress on the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice in March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat had been held by a republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district for 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to democracies.
The United States planned to penalize El Salvador for its support in favour of China and then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pekin, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners fired the lead of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call on the heads of American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Department at the beginning of the month in a communication.
However, sanctions have been planned only against Salvador, which has received an estimated US assistance of $140 million in 2017, including to control drug users and provide development and economic support to it.
The sanctions under consideration, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the country of Central America and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America were late for a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from returning to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials clearly indicated that they wanted the Conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence or now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance of the administration to the meeting, made known to diplomats.
And the three American emissaries are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new messages or severe punishments on the part of Washington.
A spokesman from Mr. Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of the anonymity.
Their proposal was confirmed by an independent analyst close to the administration, who has also remained anonymous.
Consult the history
The next case could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public file is now made up of substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also refer to his investigation into the question of a conciliation of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of the Congress changes hand, Mr. Trump will be obliged to report before this body, at a time when he is about to appear before the electors and perhaps before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes' here, and I do not claim that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held its head and replaced the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We've been wrong, and there's no chance of avoiding the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these slums and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently faced with a number of these seizures.
What would we do if Mr. Trump referred the assistant to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the nature of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to register the president in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report of the Times was inaccurate.
"What shall we answer if the recent investigation to the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-mandate elections for a Congress that will ask for accounts to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who had previously occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, six hundred years later, sent me out of the canals of the Sabbath on the swastika tree table.
With this legacy heritage, I can’t be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the European Union.
A gene injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first part of the season until match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to get the best out of such a result to achieve exploitation.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We went into the game thinking about getting something and we split up with one point.
We might have been able to bring it to an end, but in all, no match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better than the first half-time and we got back into the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can expect three points, but this will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, although I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
The last year has been very difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor in this place now.
The team is good and the boys play a lot; training is quality.
We hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find the sleep due to this fear of their retirement
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted us to take care of them, few people answered the question with members of their families.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for taking care of you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care because these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your consultant is also in a position to help you set up a way to pay these charges.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy worth getting away to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to secure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide a health care search that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also a search for your financial resources.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is returning to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please include these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There are only those who are in the game, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who cares about the dog?
Put this plan in place."
A man has been injured several times with an air-compressed rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets shot with a stick-up rifle while he walked back to his feet for a night.
The victim, aged 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place at 2:30 BST, as an "alternative act".
The victim didn't see his rapist.
Her injuries did not threaten her life, and the police sent a call to witness.
Sessions and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Palu vendredi, announced the authorities, and the balance should be raised.
As the communications were paralysed, relief services were unable to receive any information from the Doghea Regengene, a zone located in the north of Palu, which is closer to the centre of the magnitude symmetry 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
A few important facts about Palu and Doghara, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west side of the island of Sulawesi, where the population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was on its 40th anniversary when the siesta and Tsunami took place.
Dothraa is a giant which stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) from the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, in particular in the coastal region of Doghara.
The extraction of the nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite side of the Sulawei.
Palu and Doghea have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Doghía.
A tsunami also struck the west of Doghea in 1996, bringing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific sysmic fire cycle and is regularly dried by sediments.
Here are some of the main seismic and tsunamis in recent years:
2004 : A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west side of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that devastated 14 countries, bringing 226 000 victims on the Indian Oceanbed, including more than half in Aceh.
2005: A number of violent seismos have dried up the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people were killed on the island of Nias, across Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude seismo reached the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most common island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 victims.
2009 : A 7.6-size seismo has dried up the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A quake of 7.5 magnitude destroyed one of the Isles of Mentawai, across Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface seism has dried the healing of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the destruction caused by the earthquake and the 2004 death tsunami.
No tsunamis have been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the destruction of buildings.
2018: The Indonesian tourist island of Lombok has been dried by major earthquakes, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The seism destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
The old son of Sarah Palin arrested for conjugal violence
Track Palin, the former son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for the Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old woman from Wasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for suspicions of marital violence, against a signal of marital violence and resistance to arrest, according to a message published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's sex knowledge who tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in the early detention centre of Mat-Su and is detained under unencumbered care of $500, according to KTUU.
He compared himself to the Saudi court, declaring himself "unsuitable," when his petitioner was asked to do so, announced the network.
Palin is faced with three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to a prison sentence that may go up to one year and is liable for an fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor category B offence, punishable by a prison day and an fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with conjugal violence, interference in the report of a conjugal violence crime and possession of an arms in barbaric state in connection with the incident.
His partner had assumed he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after she linked the violent behavior of her son to the PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Seismo in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the seismo that dried the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude sixth caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are in panic and the number of victims should rise in the days to come.
The seismo was declared right across the center of Sulawesi, northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos published on social media show the impact point.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami landed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York Associate who has made eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would be using a truck rented by Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, crashing on its pedestrian and cyclist in October last.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered eight victims and "intendedly" committed serious bodily damage, according to the statement of intention to apply for capital punishment to the South New York District.
These two charges are liable to prosecute the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a major federal court convicted Saipov of 22 chief charges, including eight charges of murder for fund-raising, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a minute preparation and premeditation", the prosecutors said, qualifying the method used by Saipov of "addictive, cruel and abusive".
"Sayful Habibullavic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," notes the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
New York's South District had not claimed the death penalty under ten years of persecution.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New Yorkese federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiracy and spying on the U.S.S. during the two years following the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chassis on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of feedback in days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial records.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been motivated to take care of Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the charge document.
He also asked for the Daesh tape to be displayed in his hospital room, the police specified.
He appealed to 22 prosecutors.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that the decision to try to prosecute was "disclosed."
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea for guilt and to condemn him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong traumatism associated with these events for all interested people," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the popular army" at a conference of conservators.
The former United Kingdom Independence Party indicated that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MEPs suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative Foreign Member of the United Kingdom, Peter Bone, stated during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have been released" if Mr. Farage had been Secretary of State in Brexit.
But the dilemma faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the conservatives in order to remain in the Union who joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has the wrong to maintain its Czech compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone indicated at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "remove from Chechers".
He felt that Mr. Farage should have become a partner and should be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already have gone out," he said.
The member of Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We are not given world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and wants to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who likes to go out, was also present on the march to tell journalists: "I just say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
The general public is not appreciated, the opposition will not vote for, that is also the case of our party and our soldiers who travel the streets and make us out first of all.
Leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: The Prime Ministers preserve their employment when they honour their promises."
"Mr. Farage pointed out in the meeting that politicians should be "intentioned" if they were on the point of deliberating the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of confidence between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They tried to trick Brexit and we say today: "We won't let you go out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the pro-European adapters bought through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of soldiers set up conservative banners against Brexit after the start of the group this weekend.
His working counterpart Lord Adonis moved conservators because of security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are those who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the border without friction, for the free trade freely in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a public assembly in the western part of the Massachusetts.

A participant asked him if she intended to present herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman in the head of the state."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton leads to the world title after the team's leaders have enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became evident from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified to advance Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the competition.
From the pool position, Bottas took a good start and hit Hamilton on the flank while he defended his position in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the first stations and left Hamilton to start in the tournament at the poloton quay, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes was passed by the stations a later tour and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage of a wheel action that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inside of the risk of resisting after a double defence attempt in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen is part of the last line of the grid and was seven at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21-year-old.
He then dominated a large part of the race while now his pants to see a speedy arrival and move Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth place.
It finally arrived at the stations at the 44th tour, but it was not able to speed up the rhythm in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen classed fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri has done a wonderful job all weekend and has been a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get a couple," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
During a recent Saturday meeting, President Donald Trump spoke out of Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the Supreme Court of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee, but said that the events at the Senate showed that people were "bad, disappointed and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that would happen in these last days at the Senate, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, angry, abusive and dishonest," he said.
"Seeing the announcements and the fugitives, they say: "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose information?
Remember his answer... you published information-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We published information... No, we didn't disclose information," he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Fenstein did not know that the flight was coming from his office.
"I did not dissipate Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose his story," said Feinstein to the committee, pointing out The Hill.
"She told me to keep this secret and I kept it confidential as she asked me to."
But his rejection does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President agreed that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see wickedness, mechanism, they tend to know who they are, who they must shrink to gain power and control," said the President of the Mediate.

An air traffic controller is killed by hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the seismic.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is saluted in heroin after his death by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can be safely detonated.
More than 800 people died and many others were taken away after an important seismo hit the island of Sulawasi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
A large number of people continue to thrive in the region, and they are trapped under the clouds in the city of Palu.
Despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post on the violent tour at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It is located on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at this time, can be safely decoupled.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he heard she was going to explode.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikipan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency indicates that access to the cities of Doghía, Sig and Butung is limited.

Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was kidnapped earlier this year by seismicism in Lombok, which has caused more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that manages the flight that landed in a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that a man has been taken away after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that crashed.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon she has been unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships were involved in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft struck the water while trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
The authorities announced Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were always at the hospital and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact demarcation of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Marine reported that the plane had landed in the canal near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others could swim in the water until the rescue exits from the plane in the course of a collision.
He said that the board officials had panicked and cried, and that he suffered a minor headache.
The U.S. Navy stated that mariners who worked closely to improve a quay had also participated in rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the farm before the plane landed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people are killed in air companies accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but no one was involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The charge updated his Saturday case during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used telephone calls from a portable cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the last one died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained data from several portable phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, related The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers while he was supposed to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford compared himself to the Saturday bar and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck last night, Sanford replied that he "was thinking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies lie in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and Chambers' coordinates from his phone.
"He ruined her life," said Hale.
The defence must start its plays on Sunday.
The judge stated that he was expecting the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.

Another Black?!
A New York boy pursues a couple in justice because he's licensed after a "racist" text
A New York boy followed a court-martial couple for discriminatory licensing after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was "other black".
The couple refuse to be racist, and resembles the persecutions of an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her frustration by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new grandson, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"WOMAN OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her two times to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaffe, "bad at ease", Plasco-Flaxman sent Ms. Maurice, explaining to him that their former grandson, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippines instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues to bring the couple to justice in order to obtain a damage due to her resignation and claims a fee of $350 per day for the six-month house service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained at Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust her after she had been tortured.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in Post.
"But do you trust your children to someone with whom you have been implicated, even if it was wrong?
Your new one?
Let's go!"
Assimilation to a "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had only two months to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you follow someone like this?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the court of public opinion does not hesitate to condemn the couple on social media, complain about their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify themselves at an hour when they spoke, revealing a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in place of someone who slept for the first time before his publication.
It's very interesting, knowing what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small wave of lightning, would be optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a "twenty-ammer" wisdom after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family" and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always given the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we do not expect it to happen," commented Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to prevent her from dying in the next two minutes and that I should tell her goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the cardiac rhythm were being taken slowly and out of his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all about to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to have the cut."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, in her daughter's grief, went into the plane with other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was in the current," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight I've tried this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in distress deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide are trying to prevent others from living.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys showed, on a yellow bridge, e-mailing letters and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I am forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“ The whole world knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lighted any part of it."
However, he left his job before he died, since he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, came back after he had committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and who you can talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt beaten, depressed or other," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
It was at its lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had represented a huge traumatism for them, but they had to go out: "It was devastating for the family.
It's gonna destroy us.
But we must all go ahead and beat us."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh played when the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would not "fall" into a participation.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican participants want only the FBI to investigate?
Their resilience is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-mandate elections will take place only five weeks, or 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weak in their attempts to make the man they want the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's ascension to power, seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-sug, citing data from the Ministry of the South Union, stated that 1,127 deserts had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North deserters will finally grant South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that over 30,000 North Koreans have broken the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most were by China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and returnees often forced.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of maintenance focused on the negotiations for denuclearization that remained until then.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work in favour of a nuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, has imposed US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualified Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims he is inappropriate to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of "historic" and declared it was inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Festival Tribunal in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have treated her as a "historic", said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Last Jewish Magistrate.
Kavanaugh launched, with emotion, the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes failed to cry and wake up by referring to his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned democracies sitting on the committee, qualifying the allegations of "grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by liberals after Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony would prove that he was inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was against democracy.
"I think he is discriminating himself with these statements and the way he has treated Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was upset when he was asked whether he would try to defeat Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed and if the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also inappropriate to sit in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned about any decisions made by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings to confirm the charges, Mr. Kavanaugh welcomed the question of possible reverse decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a historical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we say: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women must serve them.
It's a legitimate diet, months and years of anger that start, and it can't make it out without crying.
"We cry when we are born," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she would also cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and would cry: "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry. ”
And then she went on.
And I've found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as a result of anger, in part because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a office dominated by men, where I was one day in tears of unexpressed rabies, was that I had been caught by the skin of an old woman - a cold guide that had always been a bit terrified - which led me into a ladder.
"Don't let them cry in any case," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They believe you are sad and angry because they've been with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr Hart had been taken into an extraconjugal case on board a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that he had no reason not to explore the idea of presenting himself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she confided to me at the time, 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Blanche Neige and the Seven Niles."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in the fund collection, so she had sworn that it would not participate at least in raising $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her participants who usually gave $1,000 to men were only $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a rapist?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration facing the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt confused.
"You would think I was having a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about the press's reaction to her.
“ You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember being asked what they were gonna put on my gravestone.
"She cried"?
How the United States and China could benefit from the trade war in Beijing
The first rescues of the U.S. and China's trade war were disturbing, and although the battle was far from over, a conflict between countries could benefit in Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase took place this week with new customs duties affecting articles of US$ 200 billion (150 billion) and taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Pékin returned in nature, currently violating the customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent of US$ 60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will be empty.
Backing Washington is falling to demands, but going down to the United States would be too much for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or the other of the countries is much more dangerous than what observers have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, to the reflection group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild this devastated country by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Referring to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country where they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that would provide for insurership.

"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than I am.
It was a year of movement.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
It passes the flamebow to its compatriot John Ram who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.

This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've left.
I'm gonna go get Thomas.
It's a big captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be Captain.
He has to turn around.
We're going beyond."
