He's a good coach.
You're responsible for this accident.
You can go back home there.
You can keep track of media errors every time.
You're making mistakes all the time.
I'll be more inclined to consult the doctor.
I'll warm you up. Don't go.
I'd have heard of the average cause.
I didn't seem to be sure.
I don't think so.
I'd better warm you up for three hours.
You learned to love him.
It's been a while.
You can use the same dictionary.
You could also come and see me.
You can mine everyone you want.
You can choose the freedom you like.
You can choose whatever it is.
You can choose your freedom.
You can choose what you want.
Let's get this better for you.
Let's get you out of here.
I'll bet you'll be lucky.
It's over at the rotge.
The sauna tones that are really empty.
It's too long.
That you seem to love the rat.
I'm gonna warm you up.
You can't stay in the cold.
Let me warm you up to tell the truth.
It's too late for the tribe.
They're gonna beat you up.
You're gonna be tired of studying my hard work the next year.
