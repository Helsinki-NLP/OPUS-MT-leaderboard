Spectacular salt in "wingsuit" above Bogota
The sporter Jonathan Florez welcomed the day of a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
The crew of a Wingsuit (a small combination of steel), it was past 160 km/h above the famous monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many baths were gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planners have no difficulty finding the money needed to repair the road infrastructure in a short time, many are asking for a solution in the form of a small black box located above your car's table.
The devices, which record all thousands of cars and transmit information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and the government offices of planning to complete the U.S. major funding system.
The general sector without interest in the planning of large axes has suddenly led to a strong debate and strong alliances.
The libertarians joined environmentalist groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, then use the information to edit a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of private life.
And while members of Congress are not able to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for ways in the next decade to get to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of passengers.
Thousands of car drivers have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental cycle.
This is really necessary for our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, director general of the Southern California Association of Governments, who plans that the State will start registering thousands of passengers by every California car in 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure is due to the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes the Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a thousand miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
The political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while the prices of essence are high.
"The tax on essence is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed trailers on 500 cars to test a thousand payment system.
"This would be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls it the cost of using the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea is seducing the liberal citadins, as taxes could be used to change behavioral habits in such a way as to reduce greenhouse gases and emissions.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious legislation on climate warming.
However, the representative of Bill Shutster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, stated that he would also consider it the most viable option in the long term.
The participants in the Free Market of Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers to the mill.
"It's not just a tax going into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Policy at Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are looking for.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged the Congress to go on the road to payment to the Millennium.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-M pilot project that would have taken about 10,000 cars in the last year.
But the House's presidency has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to spend thousands of years every day to get to work or in town.
Nevertheless, many States and large cities are making progress on their part.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the country's most important experience.
These car owners will soon pay to the State the mileage costs instead of the essence tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City has one in mind.
Illinois tries a test on a number of trucks.
Coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in coastal States in the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), discusses how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers have recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could track down their minor facts and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who is head of the strategic management of performance in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
It's not something people want.
Since the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU has warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into fully located devices."
It is not necessary to build an enormous and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to preserve the records of people's goings and comings every day.
Nevada is part of a number of States that are now seeking to find an approachable technology that would enable the State to know how many thousands of cars travel, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up in California on the name True Mileage.
At first, the company did not intend to help car drivers paying taxes to States.
She was looking for help in the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay for their mileage.
But the devices it tested have more of the major axis planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Serious errors were made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less honest means and less intrusive methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners try their experience by offering different car drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring to pay the average number of thousands per capita in the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to poor citizens by allowing devices to do more than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay the costs of parking, provide a "performance payment" insurance and create a set of data on real-time speed data from other drivers that car drivers could use to avoid fraud.
"The carists would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages offered by the system," said a paper on urban management.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all the debate on payment to the mill is not just a huge difference.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could manage the Highway Trust Fund's failure by increasing the tax on essence.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much of their essence, so that each payment is paid on its own.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when we just need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of law and public affairs to the Commission.
If this is done, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about the protection of their private lives and a range of other things.
David Bowie: four insudents in hearing
The English musician didn't end up surprised this year.
From The Next Day, it appeared in January, it built a luxury reassessment planned for November 4, with several incidents.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The announcement of the appearance of a new album by David Bowie had left the world pantois.
On his 66th anniversary, on 8 January 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, 2003 date) and too few public appearances, the English music proved that it could still be relied on to make the pop scene spin.
A festival for his fans
No surprise, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he cooked a real party for his fans.
This review, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in three format: the original album, free studio sessions and remixtures, as well as a DVD containing the four already open clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles in relation to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specifically released for the occasion, and two remixes.
David Bowie also made presentations of this beautiful cover in a video.
It introduced both the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and posters, a cardboard to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives an advantage to its new Atomica title, typically in the wine of The Next Day, with very early guitars and a well-known rock electricity.
Incidences already heard
But Atomica's not the only title to release her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is on double-face: a disturbing intro before a light horse that progressively slows down to place a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a little reference to Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this happy title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Odity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again referred to his foreignity: would he come from another planet?
The guitar ripples, sending, give you a desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie plays on the camel with these titles: turn around informant, man on the side of a rifle, potential martien...
It dissimulates and exposes both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Little wonder, then, that he had a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Travel, of the brand Louis Vuitton, which he wore his new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, published from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not permanently released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and neo-Democrats at the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, military members were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them has been released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accused the Government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not comply with the "university of the service" of the army rule requiring that staff be able to carry out a variety of tasks - to achieve the period of ten years of eligibility required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of the last released soldiers on Friday.
Captor David Hawkins, a London reserveman in Ontario, who suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request for a more year to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Colonel Glen Kirkland, who announced before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been moved out before being ready because he did not respond to the rules of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to begin with plans and consultations, but that this was totally different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with La Presse Canadiane Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghanistan, the army has been in pain to determine what kind of lust can it give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit for the fight.
Under current rules, the heavily injured soldiers have been able to recover for up to three years.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the required service duration for retirement benefits.
The liberal spokesman for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the reintegration of Cap. Hawkins, while neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney placed on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Dyney decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next issue of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunionor.com site or via its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on the lines of the Disney group is only planned in 2014, detailing the communication of its Disney Junior division.
The animated design, for children from 2 to 7 years of age, describes the adventures of Callie's cat, the sheriff of a West American city where she rules the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, vice-president for digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communication.
This type of experience comes into line with Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of her series and build new relationships with her audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A weekly survey published by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already served as a tablet or a phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, respectively, 10% and 38% have two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operation" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence service spokesman, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide any responses to their activities.
German President Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday, Mr Snowden in Russia, where he benefited from the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “Although the outcome of my efforts was positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to criminalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community might force the US Government to give up the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, it is accused of spying and stealing State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will be able to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been tested on the basis of complaints that NSA had heard from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely destroying his relationship with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, Mr Vert German, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country, according to former NSA consultant.
If Mr. Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the MP.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he had been the subject of a "great and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression act".
Citizens from all over the world as well as senior officials, including the United States, felt that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public interest.
The letter goes on to offer cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and finally Netflix's video service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far.
The Cogeco branch indicated on Thursday that it was currently carrying out preliminary tests on the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to value more convenient interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's president and head of management, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Cable thus invites its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's branch has no specific date for this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," stressed Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers have not access to at this time.
The Rogers Telecommunications Agency has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service can be made available through their dissemination platforms.
Cogeco and Cageco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper in its speech to the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"It's been almost two and a half years since we say that the idea of forced consumers to buy important chains doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would be based on interesting recommendations.
"It will need to emerge from these discussions a new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has been consulting the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the coming spring.
On the basis of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 ► by action.
This is a return compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83 1⁄2 per action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this claim by savings costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
In December last, the exhibition company also bought Peer 1 Network Entrepreneurs, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they have seen an increase of 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main branch, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 1⁄2 per action, in return for 45.7 million, or 93 1⁄2 per share for the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's income has increased by 45 per cent to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers in Cogeco Cable is 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of clients flying the market.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with a very live competition.
From horse in products to cattle
The meat of horses was dedicated in storage boxes of beef-based products sold by two small British low-priced distribution teachings, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in Romania in January and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained from 1 to 5 per cent horse DNA.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the British Agency.
A survey on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes revealed in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests conducted in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France was the most affected country by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four injuries, early Friday, on the way to 131, in Lanaudière.
Just four hours ago, a car driver who was traveling north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost the master of his vehicle and lost a car arriving in the other direction.
The four owners of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The movement returned to normal at 6 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened belt with them at the bottom of the plane.
The new hand baggage costs relate to bags sorted in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the ship door.
Frontier's spokesman, Kate O'Malley, indicated that $100 was planned to encourage passengers to pay their expenses in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much things as they could in the baggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers transport less on board.
O'Malley stated that these new costs will not really be used to collect money.
This is to understand the most faithful customers in Frontier that it becomes more difficult to find place in the upper compartments.
Passengers buying their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making a corner at a port of ship Frontier could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in which he could pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these charges before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's cost of baggage will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often look at luggage costs and other expenses, but air companies worship them.
They believe that the maintenance costs of baggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
A great number of people in Wall Street consider the addition of luggage costs as a sign that air companies pay enough rent to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, a large number of them have not been affected by luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage charges three years ago, and the Alligiant low-cost company followed a little later.
The only company responsible for such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, which announced the consultant to Air Company Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the costs of Spirit's baggage were $50 M per year.
Sorensen, an old Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the ship door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a smooth shipping procedure of all my professional career," he said.
I was waiting to see teeth bites and a kicker coming out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "The passengers are mounted on board at the speed of light".
Frontier also acts as Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened pasta with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay cash when passengers do not buy their ticket directly to the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1000-mile Frontier trip to an online travel agency would result in 250-mile gains.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a faithful client in his city of origin, Denver, but his business is back and she loses money.
The revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to return Frontier's funds by selling the airline.
NSA causes an "internal error" and not information pirates for its site panel
The National Security Agency working in the shade declared Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panic on its public site for a few hours, not hackers like some people had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has remained unavailable for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update," said the spying agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the panel was responsible for an attack on a distribution of services [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been panicked for at least 6 hours, and some users could not always access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not "not all" committed.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least a group of online hackists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site's panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to launch a target site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-attack is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the system's internal network.
The NSA has also been further secreted, a time named "No Search Agency" under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticised over the last few months after a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programmes – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former consultant absent from NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a planned cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund owned by the building has sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not always found new employment.
Delta promises not to let her employees fall.
Employees have come to meet employees directly on the ground, and employees have been contacted individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Labour Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of Delta is in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund owned by this building had choices to make.
Whether he reinvested in the building to continue his operation, there were tens of millions of investments while the competition was very fierce, there were many new hotels in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explained Paul Arsenault, owner of the Triumphal Training School Transat at the UQAM Management Sciences School.
Other Montréal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for elderly people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be seen this day for two years.
For Titan's GDP, "The Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After having released the espone with faileds in January for partial recovery of the Amiens-Nord Goodyear site promised for closure, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of American pneumatician Titan, says today, is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 which accounts for the plant.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Production Rehabilitation, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the shop purchase project in January, you're back today.
You said violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, "foo" unionists, looking at the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, he is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when there are eight hours of work in other countries with disabilities in France.
In India, in China and in many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices on France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well-placed and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
However, with a correct price and competent workers, this is worth the effort.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good start pay, I think that 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory at Goodyear.
From then on, Titan could move machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear salaries.
Mr. Montebourg also needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring the CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear will conclude an agreement on starting wages for all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the store.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting wages.
If all employees accept them, the company's purchase project will start with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg comes to the agreement between CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the plant, we have a strong intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The benefit of Bombardier is low, while the supplies and orders of aircraft come back.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a fall of 15 per cent of his net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of a drop in orders and supplies of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in his Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no further data on flight testing for its new CSeries aircraft nor information on whether the aircraft will respect its ambitious commercial service schedule before September.
After the inaugural flight of the pilot aircraft about a month and a half ago, the last flight was only three times, and the question was then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not at the top of the projections and the course of action was 8 per cent at the Toronto Bourgeois.
Cameron Doersksen, an analyst at the National Financial Bank, dropped his note on Thursday, passing "overperperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for rising the rate during the next quarter or two next quarter.
"Even though the drop in aviation supplies was mostly anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doersksen in a customer note.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries on fire and as soon as the flight test programme is advanced.
However, if no new order has been announced over the next few months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was released in March and landed for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of closed orders for CSeries aircraft is low to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims on energy efficiency and the potential for the new line aircraft economy.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 clients and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of the board, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 closed orders before the launch of the first aircraft.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the Jewish media by indicating that the programme was moving in line with the calendar.
"The pilot aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the ground trials and software updates were planned during the time of the aircraft's stop.
Each builder plans differently.
We have decided to proceed to a first flight and to plan an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will be played throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five pilots should take place in the coming weeks, the others will follow soon after, the company has indicated.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was in the process of evaluating the entry calendar in service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This flight test lens – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal calendar – strengthens our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. Doerskssen.
On the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147, or 8 cents per action, compared to $172, or 9 cents per action, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action was changed to 9 cents.
The income was slightly reduced from 4.2 to 4.1 MD.
Analysts expected 10 cents per action and income of $4.56 MD, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, 57 years earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 Md to 30 September, adjusted as at 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were dropped," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautical revenues fell by 13 per cent to reach 2 Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway builder, said that income from this division had increased from almost 11 per cent to 2.1 Md.
The transport department's order card totaled $32.6 Md by 30 September, or slightly increased by 31 December of the previous year.
The lines of the Transport Division have been affected by implementation problems with some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, fell from $8.5 per cent to $4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft builder in the world and competes in Bombardier's nearest, said yesterday a 10% decrease in its trimesteral profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old spelologists were disappeared in a cave under the Dent of Crolles since yesterday night, they learned Friday at the Isterian Speléo rescue.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one agarri to practice and the other not, were on the ground Thursday at 21:30 p.m. to make a pass from the Dent de Crolles, located on the village of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There have been no new ones since then, the same source has been specified.
"Spelegies should have arrived around 5:00 in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to Speléo in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on the ground
Twenty paramedics, ten civilian members of the Spéléo French relief team, as well as gendarmes, CRSs and pumpers were on the ground.
At the end of the afternoon of this Friday, the two speceologists were located.
"It's another group of experts who, after they found them exhausted but in good health in the cage, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th battle of Chambéry's Alpine Chassers were found "exploited but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps while waiting for relief, explained the prefecture.
Realized, they should come out of the cage with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to fly Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services in the following new revelations on the activities of US and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messages in a new order," she said in a communiqué.
It judges "scandalous" information from Washington Post, which says the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government have collected mass of information through infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as those coordinated by their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union that reselled 38,000 members.
Repeated leaves: a member requests Brigitte Grouwels' resignation
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "rehabilitation" of signal lamps in Brussels does not please the whole world.
To recall, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this evening at the centre of Brussels a draft test consisting of 16 fire-signalling fires in the region in yellow and blue in Brussels.
The goal is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repeat all Brussels signalling leaves for an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "threat", according to Brazilian Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamming" the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
"It is not a pleasure to spend all the money of the Brussels people in the relieving operations of the signal boxes to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues to carry out its flamming operations in the capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxes, she finally repeated herself in yellow-blue-black-black-Brussels' pockets.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
Brussels deserves more than seeing their money spent by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA programme itself.
It's time to stop Troie's horse from Flander.
"To remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of Brussels!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the port of Pont-de-Bus demounted
Pont-de-Buis's Scottish port, where a violent demonstration of opponents took place on Saturday morning, was demoted on Thursday morning.
A few hours later, there were noises on the ground, and the movement on the ground was turned into confusion.
The decision of the demolition, announced by the Prefecture of the Merchede Finistre, was taken by Ecomouv, Portuguese manager.
This is the last of the three ecotaxes to function in the Finistre department, the other two have been demounted or sabotaged.
Launching an accessory shop for Google Glass
A online store, offering multiple accessors dedicated to Google Glass, has recently been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signged connected satellites.
They can thus acquire an audience, a loader or even a ranking study.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already available from Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a carrier and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to buy a micro-fibre protective housing or an intra-auricular hearer.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with fine-grained glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of living people.
At first I didn't die, I was talking about him right now.
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I would continue to "frequency".
There is no recipe, mode of employment to pass the wall of the invisible and find the senses.
Then signs appeared.
For the first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Once again, a soft night's wake to watch her show that doesn't leave me, placed on the night table.
It's my smiling father's image that accompanys me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after she fought cancer.
That's at least what I thought about the day I found his body empty, crucified on this hospital bed in cold beds.
Similarly, its funnels were a glass-focused adhesion around the main hole of the canals that would cover its circle.
I thought she was a party.
Little by little, by little everyday or night appearances, a little timid, a little frustrated, she quickly came back into my mind, turning towards the fire and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in pain.
And then, she revealed everything by revealing to me my own girlfriends that I had not yet realized, men from my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who was in love with that person during his stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and full.
This decline in the way of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that people who love us never leave us.
I look like my father, "on the inside like outside" he looks like.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I loved him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived my body.
I saw her hands looking at my hands, and I lent her my body.
But it's never been confidential.
I could have a personal life.
He left me alone.
It's been a long time then one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and assured to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they say? What would they think? What would they do?
I always dream of them, maybe not all night but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, but there's always something that prevents me from meeting this time.
I often get anxious when this happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams lead me to the opposite and are recorded in my history and effectively, they continue to live and share my life.
The watch of my expository where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I woke up, I lay out of bed, my father was waiting on the floor and he would laugh and glad I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my bedroom to mean that he was happily sharing what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I enjoy telling this common memory alive after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother was dying from cancer.
A year ago, she was on her way with my family to Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearance caused the young bastard I was at the time.
I've done everything I've done pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times of difficulty, or even when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and I was interested in the Middle East, to make it a master in a large school, there were no anodinal choices with the back.
In fact, I often understood it as Arabic in my childhood, and I talked about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she raised me are still present, although I am able to think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
It is also for my attitude: I try to be at the height of the generosity and right of the mind of the one who was a believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a welcome spirit, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes on me.
My mother died ten or nine years ago.
He died after I talked to him on the phone.
I've been through all stages: incomprehensibleness, anger, pain, the flowers that come to me alone, wherever, in isolated places, at moments of incongruity.
Then, the time went by.
It's just that the lack, this empty no-response, this need to trust me, to reassure me of her sweetness.
However, she's there, silent presence, she's here and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes staring at me, I see the tears that engulf his face, the tears around the books that grow up in the cigarettes, the most marked on the face of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise of his bed of pain, so we had little time to laugh again, and speaking his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to him at night when absence is too bad, she invites me in my dreams when morality is a little overdue.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the time spent making us realize how much she was the head of orchestra and we try to stay in the way she has drawn us.
If someone loves you very much, the absence can't draw you from your heart and memories.
In some way, being loved becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
I couldn't attend her inhumation and three weeks after her death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs at times different from those of the sexes, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a way contrary, I don't do it and I always ask what he thinks about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, it didn't need to talk to each other.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel her presence and that makes me happy.
It takes nearly thirty years for my husband to die at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The great pain that then poisoned me is certainly slowed down, but it's still close to me.
It's very often "debark" in my dreams so precise, so vivid that I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he said "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up, excited and lighted the headlight looking everywhere, excited that it was coming.
I've always lived in the same house, and often, I'm being watched and I'm going back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel her presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy and her spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I have to specify that I am associated with a responsible mayor, I laugh and sing, I laugh, I am a great mother, I have friends, but my heart and soul belong to him, and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the most bleeding month since 2008
October has been Iraq's most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published this Friday of official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication will take place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Nory al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what happens in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives?
Nory al-Maliki was a member of the U.S. Peace Institute, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They used to brand him as a murderer and called on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug dealer of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Justice.
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug dealer of an important police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after he had committed himself to his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was referred to as "Bash" and considered by criminals as "the first important case", was arrested in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
The police officers reported Sarborough, 32 years old, placing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a barreau dinner with confreres.
The investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain information illegally on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the county of Lancashire, Cumbra, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were then imprisoned after the police took heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M, and over £200 000 in species during a series of rabies.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Enquisitors lawyers' office in Blackburn, he was disappointed after being found guilty of two heads of prosecution in court after a three-week trial.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been regularly in contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspicion and reported that they arrived at Ditta's home and placed up to 60 per cent under the lawyer's pockets in a black golf bag.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta who was at dinner at Ewood Park's football stadium, an enthusiast from the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer came back to him, discovered the drug, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Dita was arrested later but did not use cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and said that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all taken and a hair sample was taken.
In a questionnaire, he said he owned an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that he was approached by customers calling him for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were in the current situation.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know he doesn't have to break the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was a lawyer.
But this goes beyond the usual limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as long as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disappointed him.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he left his independence.
Ditta refused any illegal act and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, I wasn't, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal criminal lawyer himself since he began seeking drugs with criminal organizations."
Its addition to cocaine has never committed itself and has made it vulnerable to the thinking of members of organized criminal groups who have provided it with valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to open up behind the curtain of his profession.
The unit responsible for serious and organized crime in Lancashire conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three heads of the charge of possession of cocaine and is now in the process of justice, bearing witness to his commitment to the prosecution of criminals in justice.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you before the courts.
Scarborough himself has been imprisoned for 14 years after he has filed a case of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/responses on herself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will rebuild on stage in December

Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. at local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injuries.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the fireman.
The accident would be at terminal 3, causing a panic wave.

The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
From classic song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school client who will be targeted, an initiative that has been very successful during the previous season.
Five syllables, conceived and interpreted by regional artists, winemakers with a strong dose of humour, allow adolescents to enjoy classical music.
In addition to this show, the lyric art Society of the Kingdom will return with its lyric destinations, a formula that now serves as a living room for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the opportunity to show what they are capable of.
The lyric Apero was added to these activities, the concert-beneficiary held last August, with the competition of the soprano colouring Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the unprofited organism to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as the air of La Keye-Souris.
Without providing specific figures, the President of the Board of Administrative Board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to show off.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of such cultural institutions, the future is well designed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and constant support.
"The funds are floating and we hope to spend up to the 50th anniversary of the operation, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I'd say even beyond," added general director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child in custody at Gabrielle Roy of Surrey's school faces six head of charge, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostages, sequestrations, menacing threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, removal, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid response of the police involved and their ability to immediately deplore the situation have been essential to the security conclusion of the incident," said Cap. Bert Paquet.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective support against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, regarding sexual aggression that would have occurred this time in St. Joseph's oratorial office as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the evidence of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", which would have been masturized in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, to the Oratorium Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a carpenter and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was directed only to three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us: "I, I was in such a place, can I be registered?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two appeals.
The collective appeal which has just been lodged has in particular allowed the addition of complainants from any institution where injuries could have been perpetrated by members of the Saint-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal gathers the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the brothers Saint-Croix.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the Church of Saint-Croix and the Oratorium Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "has allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological restraint on the victims", that they "were at the root of the sexual abuses committed and have yet to deal with them", and that they have "simply and deliberately chosen to ignore the problem".
These last charges are based on other letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by the research done in the archives by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an old brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the cases.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility of the Court is accepted, there is a second stage of the hearings on the ground.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle the friendly before hearings were conducted on the ground.
Importation of fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LaSalle around Montreal on Friday night.
The reliefs were called at 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had been declared in the basement of an Indian kitchen restaurant on the Dollarn Avenue, near the intersection with the Rjeane street.
The thirty pumps that were placed on the premises were set at about an hour to master the brasier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the Chief of Fire Safety Service of Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the pumpers arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty houses, located at the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments could be temporarily accommodated, indicated the SIM.
Many opposition to medical help to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the medical aid bill to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If attention was paid to palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the draft Medical Assistance Act to Die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generation.
"What is the meaning of life," she lamented.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms Fitzback, also head of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We never ask: "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Association for Palliative Care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the draft law of Quebec deplores the population as regards the vocation of palliative Care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna wake up.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of the end of life should be clarified before the draft law was adopted.
Kenyan press is against the media dispute law
"It is a frustrating country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from paying for the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in protesting the draft law and asking for what was declared constitutional.
"This law is so tragic and very criminal, and we refuse it," explains Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He stated that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would lead to Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "the media control." The Standard stated that in Kenya, democracy and freedom of opinion "had taken a hard time" and destroyed the draft law as a "draconian".
The adoption of the draft law is at the same time as a series of measures to strengthen national security in the settlement of the attack by armed Islamists at Westgate's commercial centre in September last.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by spreading video surveillance cameras images on which the troops deployed on the attack scene were above the luxury shopping center.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the call had been withdrawn following a riot in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to be able to cover up to 20 million Canadian shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or not being able to receive official accreditation.
The Court also has the power to take possession of the property of a contrary person if that person has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single measure is sufficient to paralyse most of the FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want in any way.
“ No one will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, the political men would bring the country to failure and bring us back to hunting and collecting."
Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the people in the past.
In May, they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Salaries and recovered their pensionable salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The launch of nearly 10 pharmacies at the Laval Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) resulted in an emolument of the City-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave or early retirement, the pharmaceutical department was very weak in staff.
Nearly 30 per cent of the costs were needed, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSS has decided not to commit to independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We haven't been able to take advantage of it, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been rationalised or reduced within the building for palleting, the time when things are going to change.
We certainly have worked hard to interest our young people [in pharmacies] so that they can come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improving the situation
After this period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the CSS's pharmaceutical department.
Already, three pharmacians are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacies have been immunized over the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to keep fruit were successful because the four students currently living in Laval also decided to stay in the service of the CSSS.
Now, this is going to be much better, has highlighted the pharmacovigilance.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacies and three maternity returns.
So this will bring us together from last year.
Growing Demands
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the meth, make it difficult to predict the situation in 2012.
For us [the number of factors] is always cautious, because we have a young environment and we use many young women, so with the adults, we are almost always running to three maternity leavers when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more and no pharmacists were available for replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old model top doesn't start her career at the little door.
The realist Lars von Trier chose her to take Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This Greek pornography drama, in eight chapters that will appear in two volumes (January 1st and 8th 2014), is the erotic memories of a quadrennial increase in sex since its adolescence.
The look of Stacy Martin with his old age is striking: a brandy silhouette, a diaphane tent and French-English origins.
Not to forget a certain taste of the risk: the one who did not hesitate to put anything on the ice paper will appear in much more surfing situations on large screen.
A Nymphomaniac extract made the temperature up on the toilet: Stacy Martin appears in bed and full-extended with Shia LaBeouf.
If the cause filmer asked its actors to put their power on the record, he was able to use X professionals for the most common sex scenes, before combining all bodies numerically: above the center is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to attract his players in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't just talk about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
Yesterday evening, the first film session was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following posters' pictures to the throat.
Immediately, the director of the facility carried out the evacuation of the room and prevented the pumps for a suspicious rain.
Some 70 persons were expelled from the meeting.
The persons were examined and a full appreciation of the room was given nothing.
Mousvaise pleasure on the bottom of the larymogene jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the director of the film played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients.
The room was aired and everything was back in order.
The film has been able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrols
As a result of Halloween's day, a woman tried to get into the country two kilograms of cocaine disembodied in citroules, Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of passengers' luggage that the drug could have been detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three citrols which had been previously washed.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (GRC) who took the rest in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not find out where the woman arrived when she was arrested.
That's part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, ASC spokesman.
What I can tell you is she was coming to the country.
Since early 2013, border officials at Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec region conducted a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the attacks took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 air mission load would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new radio from Tsahal's flight to Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid occurred in circumstances that were almost identical to the one that took place on July 5th: at the time, it was also an anonymous American officer who had confirmed an Israeli attack on CNN for this time of the Yakhont Solar Missiles, delivered by Russia in Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their outrage at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forced President Assad to react.
Ukraine's approach to failure
The Standard & Poor's notation agency has dropped Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic to meet its financial obligations for more than a year.
The country's public debt securities note goes to "B-", based on the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P at least one chance of being again reduced from one year to three.
"It is less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell from 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and provides that the trend will continue.
This makes it difficult to reimburse foreign credits.
These reserves, to which authorities have applied massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, by deepening the agency, are more likely to make an assessment, which would reflect its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukraine's power in a long period of tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the following day in the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had reached its fifth trimester of contract between July and September.
Its impact was still relatively modest in recent years and S&P estimated to 33.5 per cent of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been reporting for months the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has deplored it for only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new cuts as long as the country has not adopted non-popular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new fruitful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external funding needs" were "a vulnerability", although relevant "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unaccompanied reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled in 2015, according to the expert, interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement of international cohesion.
In addition, the S&P includes the "inconsistencies" related to the possible signature of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels requires the release of the opposition's opponent, Euulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but it could have a short and medium-term negative impact on Russia's response," S&P explained, which feared "commercial restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth Ukrainian exports, has provided that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green U.S. Fire at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicists and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger is closer to the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have today announced the expiry of the period of review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a communication.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The extension of the time limit for the review provided by the HSR to the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several conditions for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also required to obtain other regulatory authorisations and to approve the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese army continues the rebels of M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would pass the rebels of M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of the Northern Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to have been fighting since the invasion of the northern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that it had been monitoring since the beginning of 20 months ago.
"We are going to continue the M23 and take it everywhere it hides because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganise themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the premises under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the revolution, said on RFI that these military returns would not change their claims to peace speakers.
These last, according to Ugandan media, returned Wednesday to Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Acrochages are reported in the hills dominated by Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion took place in 2012.
As of November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the escape of the government garrison and of the passivity of the blue catacombs of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in DRC, the most important in the world in terms of effectiveness, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid brigade of intervention composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's major state has been remanded and the army has gone into the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"M23 seems to touch its end," said a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on Congo Siasa's blog.
This would be historical - this would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in fighting a major insurership.
And this would be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the DRC.
United Nations experts charge Rwanda, which does not hesitate to support the M23 military, which is the start of Mutinian Congolese military.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to prove detention, announced a spokesman from the Foreign Office.
In the last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military reparations following raids in Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana invaded the bourgeois streets to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived for a year with the M23 and it seemed impossible for us to be a day released by the army," says a resident of this Ugandan border area.
"We have lived in terror (from M23), we are traumatized," added the man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only cases confirmed in France to date".
Mardi, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of getting back from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already killed 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, has been sold for a short-term profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its production of oil and gas has still increased in relation to the group's objectives.
The net benefit of the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a year ago.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up to 2.52 million bpj produced one year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in the expected production of 2017.
Most of the growth in the years to come will come from its natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment costs have increased by $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits derived from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the benefits of low-cost activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil has been a judi of net low benefit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Elector transport: the complaint received
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) from the beginning of the school year costs of $150 per school (up to $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transport to two residences, a service offered by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a media service offered by the Commission and I was interested," explained Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CRSS was invited to a mediation and asked for an additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to play and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room of the Hotel-Dieu
In front of the front run for several months by a part of staff and several unionists, including the CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "declare the schedule for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency which will not be possible on 4 November".
An official application is "to avoid any risk of emergency taking in Paris early in the winter" but also intended not to generate the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial provisions, closure should still be effective at that date.
Although the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
On 4 November, about a quarter of the 40,000 annual flights to the emergency of the Hotel-God will all be received for the purpose of bringing thirty serious cases daily to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the interiors.
At the Hotel-God, the emergency clinics will be located on Monday at five interns of general medicine.
As regards the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-God must be closed in the shortest time, and for us it is November 4th," Loíc Capron, president of the APHP Medical Committee (CME), who supports the project of management, says without delay.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients accompanied by pumps, only by people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, pointing out the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the ground to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will be on their way, as well.
However, it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"The things are progressing," replied Nicolas Péju, ARS spokesman for which, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service done."
"The minister has lied to us or we have lied to him," says urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
Despite his post as Head of the SMUR in July to lead the front against the reorganization project, he is defined as a "warrant launcher" facing a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are in the process of seeing and expressing the needs that have been renewed less than five years ago," he estimates.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
And they're regularly hung up.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting for Lariboisière's emergency.
In the ARS, it is argued that thirty "disappeared" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing a "valanche" in other emergency services, which would otherwise have been strengthened by human means.
The "new hospital model" is already on the way from 7 October to 35,000 patients should continue to receive 30 000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also be involved in the establishment of "ambulatory care".
"Where to go if people are asked to self-diagnosis," asked Gerald Kierzek for which "the concept of non-serious urgency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will take place as for the motherhoods of level 3.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offering.
If the Minister doesn't take action this Monday, we're going to change our jacket, Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the Health CGT.
We will be more present in the municipal campaign and think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, counsellor of the 4th round of Paris, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergency at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to break them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again reminded her of Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so there was no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would have noticed her net disagreement, notes Bruno Jullard, her password.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot allow it without an acceptable report scheme to other hospitals.
Obama ends the hearings for the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to close its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, says an American official, Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume the NSA's hearings after the revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, who was refugees in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been monitored by the Information Agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about the subject, an American administration official replied: "The United States does not maintain electronic monitoring for the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
On the basis of the anonymity sheet, this officer did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued during the past weeks.
This instruction was given at least at the same time as ending the hearings of the General District of the United Nations in New York.
In this context, the Commission on Information has approved a strengthening of government monitoring programmes but has allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that information agencies are authorised to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new objectives for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now be working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the development of " Sustainable Development Goals" for the replacement of OMDs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development which began to take place in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to “overtake national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt the process to set universal sustainable development goals (ODD)," he added.
These ODDs will support the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to achieve the mandate I have been assigned by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the WTO.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she changed her work clothes against a tee-shirt by saying "We want security" in Portuguese before she met the crowd gathered on the site of the Jewish capital's Independence.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between Government forces and the Renamo, the worst ever reached since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was also a prominent rebel movement, supported at the beginning by the White Government of Rhodesia and then by the Government of apartheid of South Africa in efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, she became a party to opposition.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The income is considered to be full growth as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal pipelines in the North-West could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni de Italy and Anadarko in the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo has repeatedly rejected the responsibility of tension.
The Renamo states that the Government is the source of recent confrontations and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Bastion of the Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the rebels then emerged when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakakaka, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government makes the Renamo responsible for settling the conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said Wednesday to the French press agency that Mr. Dhlaka would consider himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to meet the tensions that had been fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlamaka) who will not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a conference of the open and specialized University of Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well, and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections to take place in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a military asset by the Government.
The share of the losses collected by the Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by an old member of the Renamo, should receive a greater number of losses in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has led to clear attacks on police commissions and vehicles on a major North-South highway.
Most of the shelters were located in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was mistakenly afraid when he was asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things would not go well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations caused by the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slowdown in development and the recent wave of eviction.
"People think that the country's future officials are the government and the President, and that it is the last time we find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the streets," he added.
It should teach mythes and legends to children as “life-style models”, says the author.
The legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not weigh the weight of the subtle Russian," while the arrhythmian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, very scandalous and, in some cases, too obsessive to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland preceded a "minutely selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that in America, mythes and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been praying for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly educated" means that children "discover everything", the messages being "submissed" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult writing author for children is the need to offer hope.
Not only must it be simplified or done well, but there is an indistinct sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The basis is known about what we see and what we don't say.
A fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed this night and another injured by an Israeli car shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a border surveillance operation between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they removed an Israeli blind eye.
NSA spy: The United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States is sometimes gone "too far" for spying, recognized by State Secretary John Kerry, in this first full-time full-time Washington with Europe on the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, Revelations and Dementations between the United States and their European allies, the first time an American government official explicitly accepts practices that are contrary to the NSA's interpretation of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I congratulate you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this will not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London he attended since Washington on Thursday, 31 October by video link.
In his intervention, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the American diplomat has long justified information and information collection practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
In citing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks of London in July 2005, John Kerry made sure that the US authorities had since launched numerous attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings are not exploding and people are killed, because we were able to be on the current side of these projects," the American diplomat argued.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we strive to collect information.
"And in some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way," the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tournament last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He made sure on Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to affect this week with new disclosures in the press.
According to Washington Post, NASA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which quotes documents obtained from NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the baptized program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British counterpart of NASA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by Internet agents.
In order to believe one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the last month of January - dating from e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interferences would have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have all been linked to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that NSA would have been massively intercepted by data and communications from U.S. alliances and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European States and while refugees in the US press claimed that the US President was not in the mood for such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this matter, calling for national security.
On the contrary, the master of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, claimed that his information agency had arrested tens of millions of European citizens.
He even referred the flag to European information services that would be taken from these communications before they were provided to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these U.S. allies cooperate with the United States, and that would definitely not be Europe, Alexander said.
And the polymics were expected to come to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called on Australia's ambassador, whose mission was accused of being used by the Americans in a wide network of international spying that also caused China's region.
Paris Saint-Germain receives Laurent vendredi without any master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco at the different goals, published the list of players held for this 12th day match without the attacker of 32 years.
The communication simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from a left knee inflammation on his election return, at the beginning of the month.
A Memorial of Creatised Dead
Father Lachaise's Crematorium is held at 11 hours a lay ceremony, in memory of all the cremated remains in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris office, must attend and then explain his funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own purposes, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipso study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people instead of 47%.
For the purposes of a neighbor, this is the reverse: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they're lucky to lose a child, they're only 15% to choose cream.
In his book The Death in Censorship, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, he insists on the "violence" which constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cream, "a violence committed to the body beloved", which will be "reduced to a bag of centrifuge" very soon, and not after a decomposition process, which "would accompany the stages of pain".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which includes "the deletion of individuality and distinctive signs" reduced to "anonymity" of the centres.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poor in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Tanatology Society and author of the book Approves Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited its attempts to please it.
To welcome the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the funeral services of the City of Paris, to anticipate for the dead a ceremony as worthy as if he were entitled to an inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a very strong attachment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77 per cent of the French want one, for their neighbours, whether religious (53 per cent), or civil (24 per cent).
At present, 73 per cent of the people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also wanted it.
Crematoriums are adapted to this development of society.
"For decades, they have tried to avoid family violence without doing anything for an hour and a half immediately following the return of cents," observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer ceremony teachers, who, in the presence of the body, attend the following ritual: host the assembly, count the dead, link it to others, invoke it, give meaning to its death, organize the funeral.
This has been the case at the Crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
The ceremony teachers are often people who have become converts.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise’s Crematorium has been organizing since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several memorial, lay and non-religious ceremonies to which he invites families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is given an indication of those who would not be able to move.
The Crematorium allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the holiday due to rats turns to polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Furctidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Office proposed that the couple and their three children be placed in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took out exegetical proportions, dear Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There's always been rats in the cities.
The detachment company takes two steps a year, and in addition, we intervene on our behalf at every request of the inhabitants.
We have done this since the end of the last winter, 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to retreat, and rats don't push in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, dementia products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we will not kill a dog.
"We didn't invite rats to our home," the father of a family who left his apartment to install himself into the hotel.
We are soon free of charge and we expect a new apartment, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Bourse ends at less than 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Bourse ended on Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The cost was due to the return of the dollar to the yen, which was detrimental to the export values and the warning of its annual outcome launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index has lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201,57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony fell over 11% to 1,668 young people.
A house of flame projections in the Old Quebec
A fire which started on Friday afternoon in Vieux-Québec was soon mastered.
More than thirty pumpers were fired at 9 Hebert Street.
The flames were declared in a house of three separate houses on four floors behind the Québec Seminar.
All the tenants were away from the fire.
The fire was mastered an hour after the fires arrived, which had been many to intervene.
As soon as our first pumpers arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took courage to attack the building, because it is buildings gathered here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for Quebec's pumps.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: New York's 10th anniversary Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: nearly 100 years ago, the Vaudville actor Frank Fay, who played the ceremony master at the Theater Palace on Broadway, began to tell the audience about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been repeated more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival is its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the show's heads emerged in the Carolinas, and they had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, where they will be present, among other things, Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took its breadth, just like the comedy's world.
Many of the comedies who participated in this year's festival were attended by non-traditional circuits, presenting for example shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cabled chain (The League on the theme of fantasy football happily loose of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of chess on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still more known for her series of viral videos "Marel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians in the single voice (surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the Iranian defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralised world of the American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be a entertainment: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedy, but he became a film and television performer, as well as an official comedy story.
Between 2005 and 2007, he animated a TV show on Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
You have a meeting at the City Hotel in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the chemical DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he was going down a road between two buildings and he said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
The oil price continues to decline and closes to $96 to the barrel
The oil price continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing sector is powered by electricity gourmand.
The US delivery gross price for December fell from $14 cent to $96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 per cent of the day, leaving it with a drop of 5.8 per cent for the month of October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector reached Friday, which showed an increase in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to recover after growth increased by 7.8 per cent to the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades to the previous quarter.
The Brent Brut, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 in London on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE).
Redundancy due to the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas has reiterated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy which had been blocked by a judge of the first instance this week.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in that State and extending the right to abortion will enter into force.
The arrest by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVG should have a "priority of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, in accordance with his status as a member of a hospital, to allow a patient in a hospital or medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
The IGG defenders argue that the content of the law is likely to be translated by an immediate closure of one third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "priority of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, there would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first court judge had estimated that the provisions governing the right of admission were constitutional.
But the General Attorney of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the government's office, appealed to the court to cancel the first trial that prevented the application of the law.
A full hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to power, alongside audiences, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their television station, or 5.6 per cent of the audience.
But was the show at your date?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the cause of André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the invitation to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so disappointed?
No candidate seems to have really been marked during this first prize.
As every year, the first audio shows bring a wide selection of female singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some of them found their accounts.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the bottom.
Behind TV screens, the successful singer's vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just want to laugh.
The Court blockes a decision on the policy of control and fraud of the NYPD
A federal appeal court blocked yesterday's decision by a judge calling for changes in the police department of New York and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Appeal Court (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the end of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge had stated in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and question citizens.
The city called for its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to appoint a controller to assist the police department in modifying its policy and training programme associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard yesterday the arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be detached from the case because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of media and public statements in which he responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had stated that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black men and Spanish origin under their control and fraud programme.
It has appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are conducted.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after police control.
The hearing of the appeal filed by the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and mobilization have been criticised by many civil rights defenders.
This control system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of controls recorded has increased spectacularly under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls which mainly concern black men and Spanish origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
Participants in the NPPD control and fraud programme say they will end wrong practices, make police forces more effective and reliable, and can change the way police departments use policies.
Opposers say that these changes would undermine police morality without reducing crime, would represent a money-laundering and would not solve the wider problem of pressure police forces after the police force had been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and fraud, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD had implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the apartment that goes tax to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides the amount between each apartment.
We are obliged to increase our rents to help us pay the new taxes.
Before voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make changes to the City.
All the candidates told us they were going to attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us with 100 000 bucks, 4 to 5 million dollars for the case where...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of Ellysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the elysene kitchens as commissioned after working in ambassadors, the cook took all the steps until he became chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday places, and fed an incalculable number of people in this world in a almost anonymity that he is currently breaking up today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years of age.
The man on the open face, he's black-eyed and intellectually crafted, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is the owner of a paternity CAP.
His mother was the same cook in a Sologne castle.
"I've been through a castle the other one!" irronise Bernard Vausson, who knows not only the ways of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their husbands and some of their guests.
"He is always the head of state or his partner or husband who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elisée!
Instead of moving to state leaders who showed relative independence from land food, "they're all gourmands", Bernard Vaussion says generously.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the stain, the acids returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who recovered the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "There's no big reason he doesn't like it."
The current Head of State, who has recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the days of State in Elise: "between 200 and 250 people in an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand there were errors.
The former chef of Ellysée's kitchen, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, along with a penance in his heart."
He said hello.
"They're on the human side," he said.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for 17 years in Elisée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the project of flames in the Old Québec vendredi midi.
The four-room building, located at 15th of Hebert Street, has been equipped with three alarms from the fire service.
The fire went forward, but it went up on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Québec Fire Protection Service, pointed out that the rapid intervention of firefighters has helped to avoid the spread of flame to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built closerly.
The firehouse opened four apartments, but no tenant was located in the places at the time of fire.
The damages were all limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the knowledge differed from the subject of a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: out of the second trailer
Martin Scorse lets out some pictures of his next film whose role, the role of an ambitious New Yorker, is incarcated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will find you out in his role as a traitor.
Martin Scorese tells us the true story of a "long Island Bourse court," who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a wide business of corruption in Wall Street.
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up an archaeologist who will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible rise, but also the vertical fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is wearing parties, women, drugs.
Decadency and superiority in all kinds are the master words of this folk story.
The Scorge-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorse took the delay because of its too long installation.
It would seem that the film lasts at 2h45.
In the room on 25 December, he will be able to take part in the oscar race.
Coulson used the telephony to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a lead lead on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in practice, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a fake novel in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "good special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate Pavlby's vocal box and to "plant forever before her door", but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house, hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate matters: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is at the turn of the second, the monitoring cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Do you have any knowledge of telephony?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course I do."
Rumors on a link involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editor's office when a source, trying a sexual attraction to Ms. Pavlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded on its phone at least three times, was taken to the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found reports on the computer of the private detective who dealt with Ms. Pavlby and her sister in a "Projects" case.
During the period during which the detective investigated her, Ms. Pavlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information on her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minor facts and actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard yesterday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself had been co-definerant Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not design with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to perform the telephony.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in full flame of violence
The US President was to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013, the first Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to combat the most violent wave of violence for five years.
Iraq was known in October as its most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 persons were killed in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are further killed in spite of strengthened security measures and military abuse operations launched for months by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiite.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people have been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence is beginning to tremble as Syria is about to enter a civil war.
The bombs attack markets, museums, marriages and funerals.
Men are hit in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, under the power of Saddam Hussein, who complains that he is politically marginalized and that he is the target of unjust arrests, has contributed to this scourge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of incidents, including the explosion of five cars parked in northern Baghdad.
A good part of the violence was imposed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (Sunnit extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of entertainment in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the US President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in this country, had drawn up an optimistic table of the situation.
Since his arrival at Washington Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the Congress elections.
Jewishi, he asked the international community to conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a poet, for his parting responsibility for the recurrence of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian policy".
They also asked Barack Obama to understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses a group of hearings of the Tiananmen attack
The head of Chinese internal security accused on Friday a group of Xinjiang's deaf separatists of being behind the sight of the drunk car that killed five people on the Tiananmen site in the center of Beijing, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, focused on the crowd on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression in 1989, and took fire by killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office for Internal Security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkey of being the triggerer of this attack.
Many oysters, a Turkish minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkey.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are motivated by independent claims.
"The terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and predicated," Meng said on the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group that held on coulises was the Islamic movement of East Turkey," he added, his views being re-enacted by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of origin and indicated that his wife and his mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained essential containers and a stick with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The accident was 42 wounded.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican seeks to combat, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishioners manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples formed by people of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties.
The survey was sent to each national meeting of bishops in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many responses as possible.
The information will serve as an important collection on the family that Pope François plans to organize next year.
The news was reported yesterday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States.
A spokesman for the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how appropriate it would be to greet the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: The army attacks the last five rebels
The unreduced M23, a few hundred combatants, were taken nearly 2,000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues in spite of the night," said an AFP resident of Jomba, connected by phone at 12:30 a.m., and said a girl was hit by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of confrontations has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have been a little rebellious."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "nighted" in Jomba before going to the front for a "rating operation".
It was very clear behind him that he had food cuts of small arms.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the Wednesday revolt, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Stabilization Mission, combats are "in a final phase", the FARDC has "interveneed the M23 residual positions to discuss them".
Since the 23rd March (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has provided governmental troops with a firm support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well provided with ammunition, mounted on the front line.
They were armed with lachnikov and rocket launch.
A little later, on the road leading to Bunagana, on the border with Uganda, civilian-assisted soldiers were carrying a multiple rocket launch mounted on a new FARDC truck, in order to ensure the removal of another vehicle filling the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on Wednesday night once again the rebels "to voluntarily demobilize" despite being armed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results.
On the contrary, M23's political leaders hope to reach agreement.
"We have finished talking, there is no longer any more than the Ugandan media to organize the signature," said Roger Lumba, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without the immediate confirmation of this information by the Government.
The M23 was born in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa are regularly accused of supporting Uganda and Rwanda in support of the M23, which defeats Kigali and Kampala.
Nord-Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the RDC, and its sub-soil is dominated by accumulated mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people were refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC that had taken place in the morning was reversed to mid-day.
"In the morning we crossed over to go to our fields, but the soldiers told us to fill us up," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by nine of her children, one of them on the other.
We have the impression that fire cuts approach people.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a headache, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this animal of stage
Classics, sophisticated, popular, English or French, canned and dance productions are involved.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: music in French claims to be a kind of success.
Long ago, from Notre-Dame from Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts were in vain.
And the successes such as Cabaret or Misrebels brought the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes keep titles like successful tubes.
The first rehearsal, this Christmas, is excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle and Bete" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastille" and small musical comedys such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Musical Comedy Stories" and conference at the Theatre of the Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success if it has been won.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve in the grass of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a real story like in 1789, the Amandes de la Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year-old bond that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the show.
Then we have musical comedys with the subtle productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to Broadway's golden age and discover Stephen Sondheim's universe, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popular with English-saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them to French.
The independent French producers are trying to make a difference.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baser of the Aragne Women" or "The Spring Age" have been badly funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing like Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn into projects.
In the United States, music comedy is very different.
Young people are trained at these fairs in many schools.
The jobs are many among the regional theatres, tournaments, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The life of talent is also the result of the number of jobs to be able.
Why have the rounds in the province been so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre parts are on tour and it is often the bulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances meet this lack.
These are the same young people who love teletyreality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) in the head of a musical show is the assurance of an engagement of these young girls and often of their entire family.
Facebook pages of these shows are certainly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The Mayonnaise is located in Paris and enjoyed by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
An accident on the road caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the Brussels inner ring at Hoeilaart, heading to Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who is responsible for it.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m. at the scene of the accident, when the road was slowed down and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused quite a stir because the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The movement could then be diverted by this exit/entry ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured following an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
Its vital forecast is no longer engaged but it is always hospitalized.
At the time of her fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean".
She's been locked up until the new order.
RDC: The army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonized blind spot that belonged to M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013, in East RDC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last rebels of the M23 near Bunagana in East RDC on Friday.
The goal is to assign the M23 to the hills covering Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which is overflew the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall off herself.
He'll only stay at Runyonyi's hill.
"The Chanzu is not very strategic," said AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to return to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political and last strong place of the rebellion, this village is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken up by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred of M23's cut-offs have been reduced to almost 2,000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and near Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had fought every other day said that the situation had been "silent since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by guards and buried.
One girl was hurt by a ball, and three others were injured, including a robbery, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fight between FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two Belgians have given no balance to the loss of human life.
NSA's disclosures increase the paranoia of enterprises with regard to State oversight
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew to a low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the front post of the United States, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that BfV would expect to identify the presence of hearing antennas and that the operation resulted in an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of American Information Services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign information capabilities to "flight the industrial secrets of foreign companies for the account of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their benefits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant has become a spokesman, he has begun to disclose his inalienable treasure of information on the U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the Director should be able to believe in word.
Reports by the National Security Agency of the United States have exposed the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and have access to data held by US storage service providers in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised the concerns of companies with regard to State oversight.
The revelation according to which the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been fired, perhaps even for a decade, was the taste of water that made the vessel sink.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then corporate leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between American information services and businesses transparent.
I believe it is conceptual to use these data in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as important as China's industry and data flight, according to an investigation published in July by the EY Council office.
However, in all the documents issued by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication today that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men have been concerned about the fact that the EU does not have sufficient IT and the Internet and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German MP said we should create a German Google.
I can't just close my eyes and slowly turn them...
"This is not the best way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of German company software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the scope and sophistication of American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations were a shock to some companies who thought that China was the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is being made in cloud information because European officials have been aware that data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10 per cent of non-American members rejected their plans to use an American storage service provider in the cloud after revelations on the American Prism data exploration programme.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers today ask us a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic spying.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, director general of the BASF Chemicals Company.
The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level as we are spying on them because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, where this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long testified to the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional hall or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Automotive Building Board, says that the collection of portable telephones before the Council meetings, so that they can't be used as remote listening devices, is a current practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its managers to consider using simple mobile phones prepared for travel abroad because of the risk of reaching the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then dropped.
However, small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned that they remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, a large number of SMEs are world leaders in their particular ranks.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," warns BfV in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as having performed the second degree of economic information piracy in China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic spying, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal information, the DCRI, said in a interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a youth in Georgia, who has died in isolated circumstances, think their son has been murdered
The parents of a youth in Georgia, whose body was found in a wheelchair in his school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, said the Jewish family lawyer.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11d in a tape that was supported behind the grades of his college gymnasium.
The investigators of the Chief of the Lowlands Committee concluded that Johnson had died in an insulating situation, but the family of a 17-year-old boy answered those conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been killed," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it is indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“ They think this is a logical challenge, the laws of physics and common sense, ” adds Crop.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered to the sole purpose of covering the death of their son or of the persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cardboard and they turned him into a dead bag," he added.
U.S. Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important issues remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates the elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the office of the sheriff of the Lowlands county was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered Wednesday to send all video surveillance records to the authorities that were examined by the investigators.
The parents of the adolescent said they hoped that video images contained indications of the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre published a series of guidelines on how to manage the food allergies of children in school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. Government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has been greatly reduced.
A 20-year-old in the United States suffers from food allergy today.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the professional body and staff of food allergies in the child, and on how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the most commonly used EpiPen self-injector – to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The laws of States have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have epinephrine more easily in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something touches my tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on my tongue" or "I have pictograms on my tongue".
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How do you explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government, which on one side is publicly challenged by calling on the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the territory from being covered by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the room of his presence on the board of Edward Snowden?
I believe there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande calls at Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the world's columns for a few weeks at a time on the part of the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the hearings of the Orsay Quai by NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a hypocrisy cow on your side?
Journalism is not a moral position, but the search for interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forget an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the question of the analysis by the American diplomat of political issues or others throughout the world, we consider that this is an important clarification with regard to American power.
When we describe the American intervention systems against French diplomacy in the United States, this is no case for us to avoid this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we lose sight of American cooperation?
The introduction of highly powerful interceptive technology tools from the United States, but also from France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area France and the United States have established co-operation and exchange procedures for almost daily information, which are described as part and part as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah has been reported to the French through NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the other hand, - on the other hand, it has been said - that Americans can provide information to French in other regions of the world.
The question behind this question is not so much about the capacity or right of countries to have tools of intervention, but about the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter to be theirs, and ultimately the question of freedom-holders.
What are the United States really at risk of a degradation of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by the Americans can be doubled.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies, in the light of the revelations, require their confidential data to US law providers, and therefore to NSA.
The last element: the broad movement of revelations committed by the media around the world, which contributes to a debate on the monitoring practices of information services until then, could move legislators, including Americans, to consider the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersessional parents can choose "undefined sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third sex for infants born withambigual sexual organs.
The male or female sex of new births will no longer be assigned to them in a strict manner at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to register a “undefined” or “not specified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take the prescribed decisions regarding a sexual reassignment surgery for their food and to combat discrimination against persons involved.
According to BBC, one person who had been sexually abused years later would have said, “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contusioned and baffled.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexualized, intersexality being part of the group of six diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a general term identifying persons with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovaries or witnesses) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been sexually abused.
Sexual identification is not always well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to give it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if possible.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and sex-identification specialist, said that the new German law "sees to be a good idea".
Intersexed children have a ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to have sex without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the persons involved as being different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not only one man or only one woman, but is generally both at the same time and clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may occur themselves in secondary sex characters (such as muscle mass, piliotity, poetry and statue), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by persons involved and transgender in employment, as well as the scope of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young non-conformity boys now have camps that are specifically for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after having won her appeal process that allowed her to keep a "non-specific" sex to live.
German passports will have a third appointment by M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, 12 legislators from this country essentially Catholic signed a petition for the "generational theory" to be withdrawn from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also objected to the German law, writing that "because the world is being brought into a new government where sex is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be given to babies at birth.
"The role of parents is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And there are still decades ago, the medical community would consider this kind of medicine to be an arthritic, which we can delete and which we can redesign.
But now many are those who give up because of the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes cheat, not knowing how a child will feel about his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“ In the mid - 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher noted.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children who have been sexually abused was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who would consider the sex to be undesirable.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents train a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to make it known as male or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off when he was forced to throw it all away, also removing the witnesses, and raising him as a daughter.
"Money presented this as a case of successful transition, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some doctors are “always repeating this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who is born with male XY chromosomes but with ambigu sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a human.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgery and tests and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at 12 years of age.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginal disease.
But depressed and aware that something wasn't going to happen, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered scared him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment with testosterone and removed his veins.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of people involved.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fearing that the German law "invites to labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their children a "uncertain" sex," she said.
We are afraid it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to do, so we can't just go ahead with assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex appeal".
"The adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legal nature," she added.
The German Act concerns the award of sex to birth.
It's not a fight that young children should go to that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in Mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, stated that the German law will "respons" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, is born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete insensitivity syndrome in the Androgens.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have any eggs or eggs.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and married to a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, it hopes to have children through adoption services or pregnant mothers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so they do not have to make harsh decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do some tests and to understand them, and a time before writing "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You do not have to precipitate for surgery that is irreversible.
"This puts the children in the heart of the decision and relieves the anxiety that causes parents because they are afraid they don't have to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels most comfortable – and that is something amazing.
This allows the child to make a decision for himself.
Trusted Letta in the Longevity of Her Government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his Government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right of the coalition in the power of the Senate to vote in favour of Silvio Berlusconi for his mandate.
In an interview every day La Stampa, the left-wing leader said that "closely the intention" to continue ruling with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper room of the Italian Parliament will meet in the spring of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw its support to the government if the Senate, where it has more enemies than party members, declares its destruction.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People's Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as he demonstrated his refusal on 2 October to surrender to Berlusconi's insults that he had already wanted to do away with the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transport Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of firearms.
Bombers called on the venues of the drama claimed to have responded to a "multiple injured" call.
"The order forces are on site," says the airport on his Twitter account, while television images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gun," said AFP a spokesman from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed an evacuated person on a banner, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at 9:30 a.m. (12.30 am in Montreal) at airport terminal 3, the airport was also specified.
The Los Angeles Times makes it clear that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA's password was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-Sces
Israeli chariots killed a Palestinian Muslim soldier of Hamas on Thursday and badly wounded another in the south of the Gaza Strip, after learning of sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that battles have emerged in this region because Israeli chariots have crossed the border and have been targeted by your Palestinian killers.
The Israeli army was pleased to refer to a "targeted action" in the near area of a tunnel qualified as "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, cross-border and where the discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be leaving a tomb of Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama thought, in most secret, to replace Vice President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This is the most remarkable event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told yesterday that the next president's colleagues had conducted "in-depth work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama in his recovery while his hopes were dashed.
According to the political representative of Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House, Bill Daley, with a view to measuring the effect of the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary-General of Clinton.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been carefully preserved within the Chicago campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only one-half of the president's close advisers – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and the former consultants at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was in the study.
"Duble Down" indicates that Daley took the load to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties" before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not improve the chances of Obama's success."
In a interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had examined a series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember, at the time, the president was not in shape, so we were saying, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified for the "contest" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested much to find out if the change would benefit from the investigation.
"The campaigns do not devote much money to surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin on AC360 said.
However, we do not know whether Obama was in the course of his team's review of the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss had been running any remand.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president was "currently" of any change, the former Secretary-General admitted that he was "possible" that Obama had.
Martin added that Double Down did not respond definitively to the question of whether political investigations had occurred at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's exemption from the presidential list had been examined.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
Did you want some ice-cream?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took part in the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light collating.
It was the idea after reading a study on medules and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recover the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since the ice cream starts to melt when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more one lies, the more it becomes bright.
Charlie, founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible, but we're still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this trick cost about 200 £. "
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice becomes lit.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the sweetest ice I've ever created because the light of the medules is worth four times the gold.
Each bullet cost me about £140.
But she's good at it!
The company at Charlie's experimental drive, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is almost impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to reach it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medus synthesised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was performing the exercises of thi chi, revealed his wife, Laurie Anderson, in a letter published by the regional newspaper East Hampton Star and intended for the residents of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while he was looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st move of tat chi, with his hands of musicians who were fanning the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was your master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's husband also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to his home on Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will give many people the wonderful joy of living," she added.
Lou Reed had just had a coffee break last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat blonds, go to bed late and have dinner to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more penguins.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one good and I'm definitely not going to do it this year.
But the states show I'm the yellow sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in bonuses, discounts and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to with patience to every Halloween party is the trends.
Debates should represent $1.2 billion on the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexually animated objects become angry.
Women no longer need sex professionals; they can also be sexual foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I look forward to seeing many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I hope that Daft Punk's men will be among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most sought-out is zombies, Batman, pirates and sororians.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We ate our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 M in livestock dentures this year, according to the NRF.
That makes a lot of curious dogs smoked in hotdogs.
When it's good, we don't freeze it.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen office.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, suites, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a super new for 41 million children who go to the bonobos in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Mayas are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion maize grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to escape yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 well-known houses in the United States, which generate about 500 MM of recipes, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you while you're under pressure from your friends who put on Facebook and that you can't remove a guy you really like leave a comment in the "good head".
Finally, let's talk about citrouilles.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citruuille when we were ripe, and sculptured a citriculull in the form of lanter, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we've been very small.
Fortunately for us, the "birth-citrouly trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us took these potions and did not have to sit inside.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 M in citrouilles, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The Lanternal Citrus who gently flitted on your home's porcelain probably came from Illinois, where 542 million citriculules were grown this year.

The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficit structure ("bad bank") consisting of 38 billion euros (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to shut down its relations with London and speed up its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce from 55 per cent to 70 per cent the proportion of suspicious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes that it will have been fully cleaned in the next three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for the assessment of additional suspicious claims of four to 4.5 billion books on the quarter, a writing on the structure of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a contract on the past, and the government in particular was accused of entering into the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, we are concerned about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and the United Kingdom," said the new director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its preparation of a series of rallyes
The interior has 6-point rear seats and seat belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, director general of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The amateurs who join Bowler have changed. "
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rails in the United Kingdom and international, and to prepare for the rigid and realties of rabies.
We've had a lot of fun developing the defense Challenge vehicle – the championship will be really exciting."
In addition, Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North and Middle East Africa.
The pumpers were called to rescue a lost chip after being trapped at 15 m above the ground on an unstable corner in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spanish, escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
She was reported three days later by a person walking her dog tied in the street.
The pumpers are down in memory of the long falase to recover the Chinese and save a certain death
A chiot had the chance to escape to the worst after the pumpers were called to recover it safely while it was 15 m above the ground on the unstable floor of a pond.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cooker, escaped after an accident on the road Monday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately searched their lost dog and launched an appeal on social networking sites after it disappeared in the road following an accident without gravity.
At 14:15 a.m., an adjustable person who was walking his dog stood Ruby on a corner of the road, 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from the Cleckheaton pumper casino crashed on the premises and went down in memory to save Ruby using an animal shelter to transport it up to the floor.
Technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton said: "It was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the hall, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't really move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's going well now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
The technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby has had a lot of chance of getting out."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinary hospital for control; her general condition was satisfactory, associated with exhumation and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I don't think she was there first.
It was amazing to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had been gone, she would probably have fallen.
The pumps were terrible.
What they did was really brave.
They are so well-known, each of them has been absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she fell but she didn't move."
The pumps were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the popster said she was coursing on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he loved me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a Jewish statement, 70-year-old Jagger, a representative of Jagger, said that he “did not make progress in Katy Perry. ”
The representative added: "Maybe she's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make a show at the Rolling Stones tournament this year.
His new album, “Prism”, landed at the top of the charts this week.
Pekin causes a Turkish Islamic movement
"Support to the warning came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkey based in Central and Western Asia," said the owner of Chinese security bodies at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on an Internet site.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the political office of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), was in Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a special organization after Monday's attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Oiighurs of the same family of the Muslim ruling region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, precipitated their car loaded with vitals against the entry of the prohibited City to Beijing, in a suicide attack that took two and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother disappeared in the car fire.
The Etim, which declared itself to be fighting for the independence of East Turkey, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated in Al-Qaïda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Eclination Gives the Choice to Ecossais · Global Voices
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland should join the European free movement area in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and about a border of son-in-laws along the wall of Hadrian.
If it is true that Strathclyde's journal has indicated the possible economic downturns of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this would not be included in the major titles (and it was expected).
No one has ever said that EU Member States are spending much of their time around their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in contrast to what it wants to obtain from Scotland.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it's now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "dependence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old posterior account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why change London's fight against Brussels, in particular now?
This is the real reality of Europe: the major post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties that oppose the EU or who fight for the euro as a joint dividend are winning from the field.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and reached no part, gathered nearly five million votes at the federal elections in September and released the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the draft creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the heavy burden on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European Project is too far away.
The euro crisis has no great cause for contact with national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – that was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has focused on its members' exchange rates for German exporters – what German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of assessing national currency, the countries of South Europe are facing an internal productivity problem in Germany.
The only solution is to cut back on wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as the United States.
This is an inconsistencies in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
Not all global wage gels will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by a well-marketed American skirmish gas.
As a result, the major revolution, in particular in France, is one of the EU's main players.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to deteriorate.
The outcome: the extreme right part of Marine Le Pen, the national anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, referring socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the victims – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot come from the principle that a division of law will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monetary block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, as far as possible, such a block could be controlled by the European Parliament for the first time.
That's what I think: very soon, the European anti-European and single currency feeling in Europe will unite and end by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "Europe of the Nations (Soverears)" free of charge by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could save the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I hope that the United Kingdom will take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will do so in the United States.
However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific leaves Britain to think that it will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a small region of England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement on the condition that we keep our own debt.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scotland SNP government is – and is to note – the best successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed somber cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labourer, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Democratic Liberal Coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster
Studies show that young Afro-American and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity could be a trigger for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys.
The former representative of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist in family and health issues in the child.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and breasts begin to push at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite current among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time with my parents – in general, this does not mean a rapid change to complete puberty,” Kapplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast-feeding, arm-and-mouthed hair and body-adhesives, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight improvement in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half when it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
“ Once the potrine has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will develop.
There is a debate on what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "old" when the development of potassium is accompanied by a Sudanese growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, slow or stop development – it is something that a pediatrician can closely follow.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adults.
The recommendations for medical and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and impactive maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medicines but acknowledges that “the control of puberty can cause some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others”.
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will handle health issues," Kapplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules when she was 10 years old.
Even if there were signs and we had been talking about rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She went back from the frozen school and struggled to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories that lead to public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or the sexual messages transported by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, get their drinking faster.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 with the percentage of fat in the discharge of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, economic conditions to the climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger public area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and pubic dust is current, even in the food and pets.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“ This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned, ” Kapplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will respond well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that, even when this happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The Humanity to the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of Coen's brothers, the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and playful film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that began to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film was the subject of a retrospective look at the French cinema, had brought the Golden Palm to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of power to emulate Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their reflections on the American film star Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played directly, Oscar Isaac reveals a performer and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich rounds of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less revealing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury owes it to the medal when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week the suffering of a people's singer who can't see and swim with the whole earth.
It accepts replacements to the feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he's making the tour of his friends' canapas who still want to receive it.
A documenter air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of misery, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said the press Ethan Coen, co-ordinated with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two fans of folk music built their story about the real personality of the time like the folk Dave Von Rock.
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich's arrival in the village, New York's district called to become "the epicenter of the essence of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes all sorts of documentary, 33T-invoice music label invented by an old impeccable secretary, the musical choices of contemporary studios and the coffees where the singers were produced.
Coen's brothers' magic still works by incorporating a character role that goes through the film constantly: a magnificent red chat on the cracking look, Llewyn Davis's lucky partner.
Asked how he composed his personality, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had remembered having "great in Tennessee, surrounded by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary for "to be considered good", "hazard can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let anything stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He'll never know the word back.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villeers, who died yesterday at the age of 83, was just about to publish his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, New York Times devoted it to "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He then came to spend ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of 198 and 199 against the famous series of spying Romans.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this journey with a decombatant.
And before Afghanistan, it was also divided into Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, would ensure that the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, was almost half century old.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million countries are confused," he said last March.
In the hall of his huge apartment from the Foch Avenue to two steps from the Arch of Triomphe, he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, drawing a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or ivores reported from 130 Argentinian countries to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to traditional coverage with the photo of a young woman at the well-being pool, carrying a gun or a rifle.
Inside, its serenic highness (SAS) is Prince Malko Linge, the retired Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, is launched into the ruins of all the earth's wicked, Communists of the 70s and 80s, then the Jahadists of the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a set of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villaliers.
I consider myself to be an accountant who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "as the great pre-war reporters of Albert London, who went on and returned with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said "make a sort of geopolitical leafy sticker."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave," Gérard de Villaries added.
On site, I meet journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people I have known for some 20 or thirty years.
On the other hand, many of its SASs are often pre-eminent: so one month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian regime that killed several high officials, he told the story in "The Way of Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", it was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA control centre in this city, which is a barrier to the Lebanese revolution.
In 1980 he staged the murder of Egypt's President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Colot du Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported on the 4X4 Jihadists columns based on the Malian capital.
I didn't come back, Gérard de Villiers defended, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips in often troubled areas, it was installed one month later to write IBM to Marguerite since 1976 "where all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
At the walls of his office are reinforced by AK-47 sawmills, erotic pictures and photographs of the author with African warlords.
On a regular basis, for machisism by feminist associations and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villeers eliminated these charges in two terms.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I'm always very welcome to Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Air carriers are worried about the width of seats while large orders are in play
The debate is heated between the major aircraft designers about the wide range of the passenger class seats on long-range flights, opening the way to an american confrontation at the Dubai airport which took place this month.
The conflict is about the extent of the seats proposed on long-range flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most short-term by air companies, but which space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest equipment presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the Aeronautics industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The difference has emerged as aircrafters are seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-track motor vehicles, possibly waiting for a record of orders during the event to take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the seats are placed behind the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its "777X" remodeled will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus points out that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in seats of 18 large sets configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics often exchange cuts on technical issues by advertising in professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai airport, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to consider what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the introduction of a photo to finance three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled “Do you accept this?”
"Boeing offers long-acting flights in closer seats than in regional turbo propellers," said John Leahy, director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-mail travel, and during the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The 20th century average American round is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus stated that his rival had grown to a concept of seating which dates back to the 1950s, when the conference on the newly baptized device was closer.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional drop in the width of seats would improve the quality of the 53% sommeal.
Boeing answers Airbus' figures with regard to the width of seats and says that it is not for the constructioners to decide how air companies balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that experience in cabin does not depend solely on the width of seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what will make them be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is more than one issue that could affect their results.
After the dispute, a course of aircraft orders is closed for an estimated amount of at least 700 MD at the market price in the coming decades, enough to balance US and European exports.
As Reuters pointed out for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing sells both a performance per seat in their latest long-range biofuel models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a model 777 original configured in rows 9.
The unit costs gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to get more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passager at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers speak for a more denser configuration, which can go along with lower rates.
"A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert in the inner cabins of Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a supplier catalogue among which airlines must choose.
Air carriers who travel around the world also carry with them a meter to check the current settings.
While trying to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density settings for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet been sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater personalization of cabins by offering larger seats along the way on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern equipment, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the Aeronautics industry to set up a size standard for the obituary seats, but that he could forget the 777X sales vacuum.
Oracle shareholders hated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted yesterday against the proposal for remuneration for founder and director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but has just taken the picture of Larry Ellison, the third world luck just aureolated by the victory of his ship to the Gulf of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
In the last year already, Ellison had voted in favour of his salary.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 season in May due to the group's bad performance, which had lost its growth goals, but he realized about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire period since 2013, Oracle's net benefit has increased by 3.5% while Bourse's 27.5% bond course, over-performing the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anticokinetic vaccine may remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anticokinetic vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the lives of rats from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on human beings begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College of New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, since all the methods are available on the market today, but they find that their addition is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an indefensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected with liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodys trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents smoke from having its nicotine dose.
In the trials, the vaccine-vaccinated rats who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the nurses who had not been vaccinated "were scared," told the researchers, signaling that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco have been ineffective because they contain antibodies.
The injections should be repeated so often in order to maintain levels of antibodies that they are too honest and not practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but indicated that much deeper research was needed.
The head of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an attack by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud was announced several times in the past.
But the information officer, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this attack, which took place in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," said a senior security officer.
The guard, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is Not Influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New Wales of South Joe Tripodi will conduct an investigation into the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales of South Joe Tripodi has failed to change the policy of commercial strike at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the area controlled by the government.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressure on several ministers of the State to renew his pay in Circuit Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee after their ex-exploration in August 2005, without calling for tenders.
She is currently investigating the allegations of Mr. Tripodi's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government has put pressure on the poor to make a bid.
The tenants were opposed and wanted even longer duration.
In 2009, the rents for the companies of Circuit Quay, which reported about $2.5 m per year to Obeid, were renewed without any bids.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was in favour of tenders.
However, he did not change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, in recognition of Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy in the field of housing.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior officer who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial debt policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely to Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but anyway, that wasn't it.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, declaring responsible
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missions SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with a visa 457 might have to pass an "Authentication" test
The Government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion designed to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unqualified posts or as a means of making his family and friends come to Australia.
A government working paper was issued today, while Mr. Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers, saying it could harm Australian neighbours.
"The failed statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "the jobs for the first Australians" are a dismal return at the time when trade unions were asking for a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region view it as a fact of this historic artifact.
The working paper is the 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet high officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the proposed changes, others being under review.
If the "truety" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to know "if the job offer is authentic in case the candidate is a personal relationship or association of the owner or of the person concerned within the company which sponsors it".
Companies could also have to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with a view to sponsoring a small number of workers, had actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum applicant would be killed by a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of the man who had lost his life in Australia had been reunited with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he was killed.
A study designed to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister for Baron Transport Kramer stated that the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said "excited" to work with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will take on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will be drawn from Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, ranging from 32.7 Mdj to 42.6 Mdj.
The British Government, which is speaking with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of routes for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of three-hour travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baroness Kramer stated: "Our objective for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer."
We encourage the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the global high-speed rail network project throughout Great Britain.
"We are therefore invited to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I am delighted to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board shall remain in force for the period in force in Australia
Australian air passengers should continue to extend their tablets and smartphones during detonation and landing despite the United States management to implement the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Aviation Administration has left the door open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their e-books during landing and landing.
Australian carriers consider the decision to force US carriers to carry out an important task in order to comply with the requirements, but indicated that they did not immediately intend to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it examined the ad but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained and passengers comply with the safety arrangements provided by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of his intention to extend the use of his board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would like to welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said one spokesman.
Kattas stated that she was currently respecting the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during detonation and landing, and we do not intend to change it immediately," she said.
The FAO decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will consider the FAO decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters should demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review of manuals, training materials, manual baggage transport programmes and passenger destinations.
"After an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books readers and smartphones at all levels," said FAO.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the most heavy equipment be fitted safely under the seats or upper compartments during the deceleration and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in a violent bakery
The small community of Pia knew an unusual excess of red Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a roundup of 30 people according to the evidence collected...
This day of Halloween, the evening was set aside by Pia, where a line involving several people emerged from the post.
At least four minor injuries would be due to depletion.
Alerted, the gendarmes were on their way to separate the belligerants and to ensure that the wounds were taken into charge.
Singapore’s Gage Loans Loans Benefit from Medium Classes to Close the Cinnture
At a loan from Bendemeer's shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a bag and a pair of gold balls to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I are here to buy a house, so all my money is gone," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is similar in some parts of South-East Asia – where household income increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become the third gay loan company to be introduced into the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not just a quick means of getting liquid money – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as good as the bank loans are not guaranteed.
In general, Singapore's Gage Loans Loans have a rate of 17 per cent effective annual interest rate, just above 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund bank with a subsidiary in the same commercial centre.
However, cash lenders have the advantage of not requesting solvency verification or proof of pay, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to gay employers while families feel the pressure that increases the cost of living and the overcrowding of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit fed by an overarching monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to gag loans to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's notation agency quoted the growing income of households, mainly from the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of home-made gross domestic product to Asia's highest domestic product.
Malaysia is on the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer awareness in Thailand, which is from this week of technical recession.
Today, data have shown a continuous decline in exports and slowing down consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that by increasing costs, people in the middle or bottom [of salary] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people feel compelled to take into account their personal effects to touch the value of their habitat species.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the articles placed in cash in the 200 public-state loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The gold price is high, we put the chain in the gold chain of the grandmother and we'll go back to look for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using their shops over the last few months.
The increase is similar in the loan sector as ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, is intended to develop not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general director.
The company will finance them using 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 MM that it took this week from its introduction to Singapore's scholarship.
While some low-level creditors have removed criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that putting on the market not only offers higher rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Clients are assuming assets they already own, and the fact that their personal property is money does not increase household income," she says.
Engagement is better socially acceptable as a means of obtaining short-term funding.
The people who come to the gage loans are not just those who have financial problems.
The people who live in Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage Loan Credit Shops to set up gold rings or Rolex Shows, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in species.
We see customers from all sides of society.
"It may be easy people who need short-term loans for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses who need wealth to pass through a difficult capital," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was dealing with young people in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, says he is deeply attracted by this new one.
In a communication, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and do not access the Internet.
He will be compared to a provincial court in Halifax in December.
It becomes a uniform Nazi to the supermarket before it is broken
A man dressed in a uniformed Nazi barbed brasard with the wide cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining about the management of the establishment called the police, indicated the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesman from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police back, but "when she arrived, she was already a part of it," she added.
I was nervous when I saw a woman who seemed confused.
People were good mouth.
"You don't go out this way in the street unless you want to draw attention," said a customer, 60-year-old Rosina Rusin, in Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween's festival, where it was customary to celebrate in a monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I wear a black SS brasard twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
325 M's rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the 325 MM rescue plan for the vacillating health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the Government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "an urgent step" to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which, we believe, will address the unique difficulties faced by the State," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The 325 M$ plan includes a 31 M$ campaign for non-in urgent surgical operations.
2600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to reduce delays.
Funds are also provided for clinics without meeting in Hobart and Lanceston, better external care, medical training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict system of reporting and accounting.
The State will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides its services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 M$ would not be large-scale "unless they were followed by a genuine reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania".
Nevertheless, he congratulated the Government for responding to the urgent call for assistance that he had submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will make a great contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-sustainment procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton's health opposition spokesman thinks today's advertising is a "fortune solution".
"The reason we're here is that the government of state labour has withdrawn $430 M from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that holds $300 M, and pretends it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot’s novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a minutely reconstruction of time, but it is also more workable than it should be.
Speaking in France in the 1760 ’ s, she relates the story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent into a cave by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unborn cruelty of a Higher Mother deliberately sadistic and becomes an erosic object of fertilization for another.
The film never comes into luxury or sensitivity, and that's the problem.
The conscientiousness of the narrative could also become a public punishment.
Syria destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, declaring the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, declared the International Monitoring Agency for Thursday Chemical Weapons, while violent attacks were taking place in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents were forced to store.
A group of Syrian soldiers also stated that Jews killed more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) has been made with a date of progress on the deadline of
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "become useless" all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar aimed at destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus from mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas still has to launch the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including moutard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made while the fighting was taking place early Thursday in Safira City, which, according to experts, opened a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of soldiers, which followed the evolution of the human balance through a network of soldiers based in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, 61,067 civilians were estimated to be 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah soldiers.
Among the deaths are also estimated to be 2,202 deserters and some 5,375 combatants of the opposition, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops are fighting the rebels, whose number is linked to Al-Qaïda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any clarification.
The fighting stressed the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while they had to complete their mission, which was to devastate Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that was lost in closed times.
A statement by the IAC working closely with the United Nations indicated that its team was now “satisfied with control – and destruction – of all critical production declared and machinery intended for mixing and filling”.
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the moment".
Earlier this week, the inspectors announced that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damas.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the IAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to determine first whether Safira unit was one of the two sites the IIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan of destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved next month by the IOC Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage all of you have demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the IIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war is mainly opposed by Sunni Muslims to the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Al-Alawit sect, a branch of the Chinese Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there was a strong Wednesday explosion in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the punishment against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and close relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted angrily to the punishment pronounced against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be fired by an execution warrant.
Patek, who has been one of the most researched men in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be released within 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for attacks involving two night shifts in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injuries.
It has also been recognized as being due to many other leaders of the charge of terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a life imprisonment, but they could have demanded that the man, who was called "Demolitation Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision has saved painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny in the destructions of Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On behalf of the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"It should be trained in front of the execution panel," said Mrs. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor van, exploded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a Kamikaze shot a bag of two-loaded explosives 20 seconds earlier.
He fell asleep in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was under spiritual assistance.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samura – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep him alive, so there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being arrested for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistanese city of Abbottababad, where the American forces will kill the former chief of Al-Qaïda, Osama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent reported that reports of information services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaïda.
"He didn't come back," Mrs. Corteen added.
Until recently, he had lost his grief that he could have caused other people.
The summit was attended by the 10th anniversary of the events that will be held later this year and marked by events in Bali and Australia.
"There will be plenty of flowers this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may, however, call for his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use on-board gadgets (but not pass a call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic port devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk on their mobile phone – under the very new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be made will vary from one airline to another, said FAO administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will need to prove to FAO that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on equipment classification to be consistent.
The FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
“In line with the plan, we could approve the wide use of electronic devices very soon,” stated FAO in a statement.
Currently, passengers must extend their smartphones, tablets and other devices once the airport doors are closed.
They are not allowed to light them before the plane reaches a altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to extend their devices during the landing before landing and do not light them until the aircraft is installed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines which are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during landings, landings and ground traffic, the FAO stated.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenants, welcomed these changes.
“ Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with carriers for it – this will be beneficial to the world,” explained Glading in a statement.
We are clearly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange e-mails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers should put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So not always Words With Friends, the online style game Scrabble played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown off a American Airlines plane after he refused to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And heavy devices like portable computers should always be arranged because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board telephones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for portable phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAO.
The FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices during deceleration and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of National Transport Safety Board, national security expert on CBS News, stated that portable phones were still considered to be at risk.
"The portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disturb mobile phone relays if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial consultative committee established by FAO to address the problem has recommended that the Government allow wider use of personal electronic devices in the last month.
The pressure on FAO has increased over the past few years to address restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-MO, argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
FAO began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high tech then.
New online aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous aircraft generations, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by FAO.
Air companies allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise altitudes for several years.
Changed aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems also resist better interference.
The vast majority of line planes should allow wider use of electronic devices under new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less power radio transmission than previous generation of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only send minimum transmissions when one page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when television devices send or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure to supplement restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders charged an electronic book reader plane Kindle and made it available to see if there were any problems, but there was no one there.
This inspired the members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mixed Feelings on the issue of whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passersers stated that he thought that the interference from devices was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there were only anecdotic reports of pilots indicating that devices can interact with aircraft systems and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAO allow pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry welcomed the change, calling for sound arrangements for skilled technological travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAO recognizes that an enjoyable passing experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird of a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helitreulated after being found exposed on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water flow was mounted on a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was sent back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue center of Alloa.
The director of the Centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This river was probably a winter migrant from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to call again, so we were contacted to help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and to define what wealth and jobs creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
In order to do so, we ordered the largest and most complete investigation with British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernising and developing while the EU's States are stagnant.
They want to see the Government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than in the long and long process of reform of European institutional archives.
When asked for their opinion on specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – most business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has given rise to general dissatisfaction, which companies say that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits it has to be part of the European trade area – 40% of the largest companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are also agreed.
Finally, and what is more, our survey with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain continue its initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The challenges are high – changing the treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow for a 16% reduction in the EU's EU-backing vote.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate Britain's accession terms to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means refocusing on trade and fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States of America at Halloween's Colours
In the United States, President Obama did not depart from Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed franchises to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween on the east coast of the United States had been canceled due to the passage of the Ouragan Sandy.
So this year, the parties have been kidnapped.
In New York, thousands of people have participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone's over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're acting like rats, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated in the custody of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gaza, Europe's largest-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, director general of Gazprom in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should allow Russia's export routes to Europe to diversify.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which most Russian gas is allocated to Europe, increases the risk level in relation to conventional roads, adds the Director.
Miller added that direct accession to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "always".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should begin in other countries located below the end of the year.
The gasduct was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced daily The News of Tahiti, including information from Australia's Radio.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, on its midway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area measures 47 km2, if it has three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the monks of the Bunty, an episode of the history of the English sea that takes place in three Hollywood adaptations.
Some dozens of residents, most of the descendants of Bunty's mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95 per cent of London's generosity.
The island Council voted unanimously in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836 000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic area.
An assistant to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836 000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to zone surveillance, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are located.
As for France, it must already carry out the very cost of air and maritime surveillance of five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Living Prison for an Ancient Chinese Deputy Governor
An old deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeastern part of China, was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of killing more than 19 million Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, announced the first interim court of Beijing on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took up his duties in March last, made the fight against corruption a national priority, assuming that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the Head of State had promised that justice would be as intractable with the "tigres" powers as with the "mush" - the subcontractors - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them were former members of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most recent case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having seen the highest posts in the state.
However, the Government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system, for example by creating an independent body of the party.
Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the South New Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults on children following allegations made against educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never dealt with a problem of sexual aggression against children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned on two matters: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, Counsellor to the Commission that he had knowledge of the first case but that he was not in the course of the second case.
He also admitted that the JMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by highlighting that "external control of YMCA was carried out and indicated that child security was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst appreciation of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a mistake with the recruitment of Lords and that he was willing to verify that employees knew they had to report any violation of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced to sexual assaults on 12 boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
However, Mr. Hare rejected the idea that YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to children's safety.
Members of the staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them private, kept them on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found the child services manager of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would frame Lord "very scary and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said he rejected the evidence of staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he stated that their friendly relations with Lord had distorted their judgment, which led them not to report their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his point of view in front of the South New Wales YMCA Council saying that for the organization, the lesson drawn from the Jonathan Lord incident should not concern "the signal" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreements was taken shortly after the allegations had been made by the Director-General of the YMCA for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was "excessive" and that it had not been implemented.
The South New Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith to the Commission.
He indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and staff supervision.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but recognized that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, 59-year-old man learned his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and the role of the special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's post, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to the London Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it probably does, so..."
When many experts in these events met in Cardiff to face and overcome the Cheval's trophies of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after he had made his first weapons, his little Shetland Toffee and Pony Hetland Toffee crossed the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving them behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition held at the Sunnybank corner centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his plate somewhat on the side of a detachmented way of making his 2-year-old Pony Toffee stand around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his unusual natural qualities of dressing for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton gave Toffee a gift for his 3rd anniversary in March and has been trained since his Pony Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a great due. ”
They presented themselves against and against all, but the two of them cut the cup in gold and the rose.
It was only the second time he cooperated with Toffee and we were so happy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him didn't think he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This young man, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his uncle Sharon Howells, who has been participating in these competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "There was electricity in the air, and the whole world was encouraging and encouraging it."
He traveled all the length of the current track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a great job.
Fenton is a crazy animal – he worships horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
In the way he started, he will soon take part in the performance of the Year’s Cheval – and I am sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian demonstration said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and the way they stood on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of himself.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be rehabilitated ”
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a disclaimer accused journalist will be remanded, states a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted wine powers to make stories about a semi-public society.
At present, the New Express will take place a “complete management”, declared the regulator.
The "remand" order is issued by Guangdon administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on Cotejo Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake complete New Express management, and recommended that it conduct an investigation on the persons responsible at New Express and immediately manage the magazine management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities alleged by a singer named Zoommion.
After his arrest, his journal published twice a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to have published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hired Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its capacity to gain public confidence," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I made a mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his excuses on the first page, writing that he had not verified his articles correctly.
A number of important suspects have recently made television broadcasts.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their eyes, despite a change in the law that has been voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to commit suicide.
Charles-de-Gaulle Airports in "Indivisibility"
In Toulon, the airport is on fire.
The radioactive steam flight detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear heaters in mid-October and when the ship was at sea, it was "without danger for the mariners", but it was not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royale has come to confirm us "the inability" of the ship until "the mid-November", "the time to take corrective measures that are imposed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence ship specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, which are located in the Var for the occasion, "acting at the airport."
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failed heating.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013, however, DCNS explains.
And the National Marine is to certify that "it does not give up on the ship's programme of activities" to nuclear propulsion.
Remember that Charles-de-Galle aircraft came from an average period of six months.
He had traveled from Toulon to mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "various petite", surrounded by the reactor's restraint space, was then produced on the amral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Sea, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, however, I am still finding great satisfaction with the people I meet: a demonstration of their properties, tax relief, the cost of all kinds of permits, administrative costs to no longer end.
Bref, symphony with no limit to our pockets.
Millions of dollars may be saved in order to allow a very respectful tax on those who suffer.
All money taken from the taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their recovery.
Despite the closure of all major companies, there is no doubt about the cost of subspecies and maintenance of bottlenecks: weak cultural centre, strong subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private company or they are discarded.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a larger industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not for public investment in such enterprises, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were happy to learn that fishing and Piles lakes will continue to provide the city with drinking water.
As a result of the start of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline in the population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying about the pipeline, the city would never lack water and strict regulation on its use could be very adopted.
In summary, it is very easy to make big things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a style without passing through a contract order.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cattle with beautiful diplomas for most people and I believe that only a taller sheep breeds worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secrets they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzaging on a length of about six long football fields, is covered by portraits near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with indefinable warehouses, which allow for easy dissipation of drug-cars.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were taken over by surprise, the authorities declared.
The authorities took 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the arrival of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, making it a challenge for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found about 700 yards of iron roads that were part of the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
The British police issued an extradition order against Assange
The British police have today issued an extradition order against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who has fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and has requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had delivered a "remission notice" against Australia for 40 years, asking him to submit to a police commission, adding that if he did not do so, he could be arrested.
Assange could be extracted from Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Ambassador of Ecuador to London on 19 June, asking that South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has delivered a notice of resignation against a 40-year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police commission, on the date and time of his election," said a spokesman.
It continues to violate the conditions of its release under appeal.
The Ambassador refused to comment on the delivery of the notice by the police.
He was afraid of being taken from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after having released more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site to combat confidential information.
How Biometric Enriched Our Lives
End the words to tap to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric receivers of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only the biometric will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as well as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this concern for biometrics, but they are concerned.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of printers, hand form or hand-held network in companies, administrations, canteens...
"All the world will soon be identified, wherever and whenever," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism, among others?
The biometric will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are digital presses, hand-circuits and the wine network of wood or gums.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people working on concrete have very heavy fingers and their printers are illegal," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at such Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as verification of the wine network and the hand-circuit are voluntary and precise management of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture these data into their content - and a coincidence: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research has been conducted for 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the precision of sensors and computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by 10 over the last five years, calculates Cyril Bataller, director of the R&D Accenture laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
"Today, we are doing research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound capturers, but there is a need for a quiet environment," says Srðar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
Unique and inflexible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the latest biometric data," confirmed Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and the prospectus for CINIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a bill of $90,000 to analyse DNA samples on the location of a crime and at an hour.
Biometric uses are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification concerned the delivery of identity papers so far: biometric elements (printers, photos, iris) must be compared with information that the State already has on all its citizens.
This allows you to make sure that no one tries to take the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers the recognition of VIP at the entry of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and comparisons to photos of celebrities that are freely circulating on the Internet," Danny Nassif explains, at NEC France, of trade development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of someone who makes the noise in a store, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the time to wait.
The authentication concerned physical access (borders, protected areas, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the copain that points to another," explains Cyril Bataller, of Acenture.
However, more and more, authentication will also involve transactions, particularly those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by inserting their card and placing it on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the cover of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villanuve-d'Ascq and Angoulème by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and large distribution teachings: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not break his code, but introduces his shower into a reader that scans wines.
The experiment is intended to last for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon reach French traders.
Tracks to refresh users
There are three ways to make biometric sedulating in the eyes of the big public.
The first is to explain that it can make time.
"If, thanks to the biometric, a customer remains in box 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to provide personalized services: within a few years a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options on a scale.
Finally, ensure by prioritising the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The digital printers are stored on a first server; the identity of the people is in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, in the absence of deep study, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Specialists of the protection of private life continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worst: a generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A driving driver running at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs saw a mandage of 1000 £
A car driver saw an amme of £1,000 for running at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on A120 to the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the misconduct of conduct without the necessary discretion and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from its permit resulted in a six-month permit withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners for excavating the London bull
The Treasury provisionally calculated the tax rate on capital gains but expected a definitive decision by Mr. Osborne that, in the 2012 budget, entered a 7 per cent stamp right for property costing more than 2 MM and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties in a company rather than as individual.
Timber law already applies to the residential property of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea rounds, and represents 708 MM on the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West and the Yorkshire and Humber Region.
Mr. Cook stated: "In view of the increase in the law on high-value property and the introduction of the anti-prevention law on property, it is very difficult to advance that high-value property is subject to the effects of the system of absolute housing tax."
"But this change could make foreign investors less sensitive to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners less sensitive to the idea of selling," he added.
The loan real estate – 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector in southern London, which is located in Fulham, Wimbledon, has increased by 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in the centre of London show a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent but were eclipsed by a full "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) known as a repetition, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have come to light how the movements of a dog's neck are linked to its moisture.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs were more likely to move their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs were more likely to move it to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: “The whole world knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions. ”
Here, we tried to see what it was with other species.
He added that even in man, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of other dogs, researchers have followed animals looking at films of other dogs.
They measured the cardiac frequency of animals and analysed their behavior.
We will certainly not need long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes from one side to the other.
Professor Valortigara explained: “We presented to dogs the films of other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to deal with the movement of the knife and present it as going to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression return the knife to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the knife), they were perfectly detained.
But when they encountered a qualifier mainly due to the left (again from the dog's point of view of the quay), their heart rate accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Valortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet several times with other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will respond to this experience.”
Researchers indicate that the results could help owners, veterinarians and designers better understand their animal emotions.
Canin expert John Bradshaw, an invited professor at the University of Bristol University of Veterinary Sciences School, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs were going to a robot dog more easily when its tail moved to the left than to the right instead of to become anxious – the reverse of what is in the Italian study."
He pointed out that differences could result from the fact that dogs participating in the various studies would not consider the animals of films or the animals of robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be specified – and dogs do not make any exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why they sometimes move from one side to the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after it was diagnosed with a lead to its singer.
The Sheffield group was to be held on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city center.
However, its length forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the group was obliged to report the same concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: “After the decision to report the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after having asked for medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to Hydro de Glasgow on Friday 1 November”.
"Alex Turner suffers from a longness and regrets that he can't perform concerts."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and on the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We want to apologize to all the ticket holders for any damage caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Pope François named his first cardinals in February
Pope François appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, he announced the Vatican Jew.
Cardinals are the men of the highest church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will definitely choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer take part in the election of a pope – this therefore leads to a group of 120 "electronic cardinals".
In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting to gather all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which the bishops would be exalted to cardinal dignity, known as constituencies.
"The father of François decided to communicate his decision to call on the composition of February to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voix said that by February, the number of electoral cardinals will probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed as cardinals as much as he needed so that the number of electoral cardinals would reach 120 and as many older cardinals as he wanted.
The composition of the next year will be important because this will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to give priority to Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals of the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40 per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be elected since François formed the cardinals' council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope had decided on his own.
"Now François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "all possible" that François asked for advice to cardinals.
But we have never known such a situation – it's completely new.
Valero pointed out that the popes were generally raised by bishops representing large communities in the cardinal class, but François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is. ”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seating folder
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new peaks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to address a problem with manual files, according to a sales statement by the American vehicle safety control body.
On some peaks, seats could have been a failure at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the records do not respect the federal safety standards of vehicles with respect to head restraints.
"If the vehicle is damaged by the rear, it may be that the head may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injuries," according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represented the most important launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM reported missing pickup owners during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day arrest of government activities, which slowed the increase in vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by around 20% during the first 10 months of the year, announced GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The course of GM actions has risen by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at New York’s Friday after noon.
A dead worker trained under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama occurred at 11 a.m. on the street Marquette, near the intersection of the Beaubien street, in the vicinity of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is true that the work on the foundations has been carried out in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall had grown up in the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim arrived at the castle to recover his tools.
I walked through the car and saw the wall crawling with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stayed near the castle.
I've been down and I've been going to take off the big glasses that would cover it.
We saw only one part of it, it's so bad.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in his 50s who worked for a bakery company.
Reanimation manuals were tried by emergency services but failed.
Man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was posted on the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said Obama had made commendable efforts by the Obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in the 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a book that's so sad these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records last night and I fell asleep, this book reminds me of the time when the policies inspired millions of people and where the talks could cut your breath.
The election ended with an exciting victory and news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried out with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period of Obama before its entry into office in 2008, he had 82% of the views favourable.
And then I'll close the book.
The return is a difficult revelation, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, which are like long memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I refer to Obama's credit for major achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the Law on Approachable Cares) to the departure of Iraq from our army, passing through the end of the "not known" and the murder of Osama Ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that participation has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama's administration against my friends and colleagues, I am no longer able to provide explanations.
I am on the side of political despair.
The Republican barrier cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the United States, or on the prosecution of prosecutors who reveal the Government's misconduct.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awkaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funds and the over-expenditure of authorized expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that House-Blanche's efforts to reduce media silence are "the most aggressive... since Nixon administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple Internet site for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that the government could oppose the previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable because the political party of opposition and events that are happening by random means, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have cited above appear to be mostly the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unfashioned alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term of office, being free from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the rate of favourable opinions has increased below 45 per cent this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He wants me to see the many promises involved.
This week, I read part of the book describing how Obama suffered enormous losses for the benefit of Clinton to the First of Pennsylvania.
At a post-commissioned meeting, he told his team that they had to return on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are here 5 years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, at 15 o'clock, a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred in Retine street in Fréron.
Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, didn't wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it was killed in this front collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
billionaire Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be encouraged and benefited from it.
The mining extract magnet, which is responsible for the payment of a carbon tax of $6 M, has made this argument to try to remove any conflict issues.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a divorce," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially announced that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes to 53 with three abstentions.
Mr. Palmer has developed the idea of remanding the suspensive system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can log in, take your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crates to mark ballot papers.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, there seems to be a lot of paper.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for electronic vote and has recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of boss duphin across the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouverous, responsible for scientific missions to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Millieux Marines (OCEAMM) returns to The Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boss duphine surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enable us to improve our knowledge of species classification.
Furthermore, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology result in the classification or belonging of a species to a species, a family, even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on differences in morphology between species.
Today, some of these classifications are reimbursed because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close morphological species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific forest duphines and the Atlantic forest whales.
Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic diversity.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, which is only present in this area.
Since then, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we may have to deal with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population of a larger species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered by the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinasis, whose population of the new species discovered is emerging, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Sea mammals are located above the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This germination limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, the more close ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
You need to know that the marine environment is the least known.
We prefer to send robots on Mars, that is, what lives in the Marianne Valley, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it's a lot of time than that.
RBS suspends two traders on the change market
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its change market division according to two close sources of the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on the suspected manipulation of the currency market begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BB, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market surveys, where 5.3 billion dollars change from day to day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the extension of the investigation which is due to the scandal of interbank manipulation at Libor.
The Bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation of this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, close sources of the file stated that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages sent to and by an old trader, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the British regulator.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and would have been suspended from his position as European trader in account for deposits at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European currency exchanger at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency exchanger at Barclays and BB, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have made any accusations.
The case of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding close sources of the case.
BB explained this week that she had attempted to act against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said he was investigating suspected of manipulation of the change market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – consider allegations made regarding bankers that would be understood to manipulate the rates on the change market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received regulatory information requests, indicating close sources of the file.
Banks are sending instant messages and e-mails sent for years to find cases of reparable acts.
The news on these surveys have exposed traders in a sector which has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks in recent years, but which has been reimbursed for this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the matter by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the broad market for highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the more frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the low-cost market".
The new took place on the same day that the Swiss Credit announced that a trader had been sent to his office by the London Exchange this week after causing a loss of $6M at the end of the last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been handled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The survey on Major Rob Ford was closed, supported by a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, I Clayton Ruby never supported having seen a "too" survey.
My Ruby said to believe in the Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
This afternoon, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual friend and driver, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of being extroverted on the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had also observed this man delivering colleges in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never broken Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair chose in knowledge because he did not act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having been witnesses of suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out an investigation - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant if necessary.
The chief of police has not commented, but his spokesman Mark Pugash has qualified Me Ruby's "exact and desperate attempt" to speak to the media in a matter that doesn't concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" which could lead to the deposition of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Tours in mid-session except London
With the exception of London, the main European Bourgeoises are moving down on Friday to mid-session, which has been blown up by some new decades of companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors are cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could deplore its quantification policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after an inflation announcement of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea grows among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could implement its monetary policy.
Wall Street's future will allow for an opening of American actions on an increase after two consecutive replocating sessions.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) records the most powerful CAC 40, blown by the warning on the result of his partner Nissan Motor vendredi.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also having published the results of this morning's decline and announced the internal creation of a disability structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion of the most risky assets books.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is held in the head of EuroFirst300's peaks in response to a press information that wants AT&T to study any OPA.
On the change market, specifications on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are going well in practice, as confirmed by John Hardy, the Saxo Bank strategy.
The only mandate of the ECB has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for downsizing the euro.
In this context, the euro continued its response to the US currency and touched at a minimum of two weeks to $1,3517.
These same concepts support the binding market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court is valid for the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court has today declared that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges have ratified the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Health Protection Act) – which requires citizens to sign health insurance for 2014, despite having to pay an amendment – and have declared it constitutional under the government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, addressed the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which provided that there was a need to lower the level of eligibility for Medicaid in order to lose all federal funding of the programme, was consistent with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates at the presidential election at the 2012 presidential election, including the designated candidate Mitt Romney, were deliberately opposed to the law.
Vibrant respect for the old combatants in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriot associations, made this Friday afternoon, a tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerebs were deposited in two of the three military corridors of the cemetery by Mr Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Increasing between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, 31 October 2013, at night during an increase in the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant stopped operating on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks were exhausted, announced the Palestinian prison's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas army branch, Rabbieh Barikeh, were killed by an abusive shooting during an Israeli army invasion in eastern Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Brigades Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a border surveillance operation between the Palestinian slave and Israel.
An attack on a Palestinian-crossed tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli war chariot and blind bulldozer had taken a hundred yards across the territory before leaving.
The interview lasted half an hour, according to the witnesses.
In a communiqué, a spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zohri, showed respect for the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen by defending their territory during an intrusion of the Zionist occupying forces in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas ensures Gaza will be a hell for the occupying Power," threatened the spokesman.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the objective of its operation was to launch a section of a wide tunnel across Israeli territory from the Palestinian slave, discovered on 7 October and destined for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to get Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said military spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in the north-west of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli flag" but did not provide details on the target.
"For the past, the targets have been transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
Israeli Government officials refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "bombing has meant a cargo of air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that combats the rebellion on the part of the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had been subjected to several Wednesday explosions in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of military and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Choinard, who presents her two new group chorographs in Dance: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's poems and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
One evening that allows you to see all the Chowinard's work, the art of the ticks and the black hole in the white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the vast space as the Housenive Theater, progresses, profile, end as a line and black clothing, a body.
On the screen, Henri Michaux's cover is designed.
The body, just wear it, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of all parts: a set of physical imitations of designs.
The dancers, completely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, are waiting on each side of the game air, they are precipitated when the next graph appears, they are incarnate, and they are coming out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made up of solos, a group of solos (a mass that makes solo), a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Morning Glory", where, on the ground, Choinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on maps, placed online in front of the scene.
It's the same principle, version PowerPoint giant.
Here, music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be chaos when Carol Prieur will flee under the stage of dance, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retention, part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotonous in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to share, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long as possible, ends by freezing and swallowing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chowinard - such as these hair that get drunk or these black tissues that extend the lines.
But the choreographic approach is lacking composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, imposed on himself, with his tickets.
Result: bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
The entrails of Michaux, such as Gestalt forms, open a broader and gibojele imagination than the dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative terms, with its dancers drawn by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a sudden black theater, is touched by magic.
The public loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the entry, are more rich.
The scene is partly gripped by grass, dancers and a piano are covered with fabric, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers joined in playing the parties.
Their music disorders, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, couples, in two loving, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, sets that move, voices, writing is less binary.
Buffoons also appear from Choinard's families, treeing the red nose, in loving parades of very polarized men and women.
Loves are charismatic, running or players.
The gesture, the laughs and the small crises well convey the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies in coit, of beings that are founded.
But the room takes its real involvement after the rescue.
A clown returns to scene when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall, the skyscrapers are superseding, the cabotine dancers, descend among the spectators, smells, smokes, surrounds around, plays the codes of applause, excavates the sauce into a well-calculated desert that remains sedentary.
The joy and the leaves are transpired, and it's Choinard's art, there, to pollute the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings concerning the Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of ancient Nortel patents has started a judicial prosecution of Thursday patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it has coeffied at the stage when selling the patents that took place after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the Consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for 4.5 MD, complained against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent violations companies before the United States Court of Auditors in Texas.
Rockstar is held together by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven letters.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising in relation to Internet research terms, indicate the conclusions of the process, which is the heart of Google.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unable to join.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating under the Google Android operating system, which provides fair competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 MD.
After losing Nortel's patents face to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for a amount of $12.5 Md, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire patents during the investigations, it has violated and continues to violate those patents," said the process's conclusions.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests than Google, because he claims that Google's patent violation is being suppressed, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a water-discharged from the source of the explosion
The grandmother would've lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a room in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old mother and her 5-year-old son, was due to a gas leak from an defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert posted by the park ensures that the source of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital forecast of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and was badly burned.
The little boy, who lived with his father and his friend, was next to him and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long-term conditioned on the ground before being taken to the League's CTU, she was in helicopter, her in ambulance," said bourgeoiser José Paulet, down on the ground.
Traumatized, the great father was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Health and safety, he was able to gather the retreaded by the ladder remained intact while the wall behind the house was completely destroyed.
The Grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, frustrated by the explosion, were rejected by the president of the CCAS.
The Andenne and Namur pumpers and the Arches police have been interviewed.
The civil protection of Crisnee has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first President to be elected free of charge
Mohammed Morsi has loaned the investment firm, but it is unlikely that his triumphal day will mark the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he presented the investment firm to the president, thus becoming the first freely elected and successful president of Hosni Moubarak who was cut off from power 16 months earlier.
In his investment before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first free-elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt's state since the monarchy's reversing 60 years ago.
He was standing before the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We will look forward to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solar ceremony on public television.
"The people of Egypt today have laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years in the United States, from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that has been considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and which has been constantly oppressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived about 11 hours later, at the local time, following a small train.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to welcome the new President and, with the presidential fast of Moubarak's years, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of its journey to the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the south whales.
Viewed as the charismatic "Row of Relief" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he has tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Muslims but of all those who want to finish the work started at the 2011 election against President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red curvature, addressing the judges present in the Ornithous House where he has borrowed beer.
Later, Mr. Morsi returned to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national hymn while he was keeping watch over you.
Major Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and old lay education, the University of Cairo later became a group of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic ceremony on the Tahrir place, where he was part of the settlement that ended the authoritarian regime in Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, who replaced the former former vice president, deposited him.
But by agreeing to formally present before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is to be used, he appealed to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's address on Tahrir's place was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States has slowed down the growth of the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations was focused on the increase in the sales of cars in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the builders on Friday, five of the six main performances lower than expected.
The three great constructors in Detroit show an increase in two figures compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
The analysts predicted an average of 15.4 million annual and adjusted sales of seasonal variations, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, analyst of Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight cut of brake is first explained by "the "shutdown" government and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fifteenth of the month".
However, GM has made a progress of nearly 16 per cent of its sales in the last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared with 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improved by October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-up, saw his sales increased from 14 per cent over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus expected 194,301.
On his side, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales to consensus, despite increases of 8.8 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively.
At the New York Bourse, GM action won 1.4% to 16h35 GMT while Ford dropped 1.1%.

Greece: two deaths in a rifle near a site of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was badly injured on Friday night by fire cuts by two persons who were on board a motorcycle that was heading toward a place in the western coast of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political belonging.
Some Greek media reported that members of the Dore Aube had supported the victims as guards of their area.
The injured person was soon hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist police were stationed on the central Avenue of the Neo Iraklio Bay, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the charge of six honourable Members of Aube, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party following the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.

The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers in the black, the Montenegrin with 13,464 and the Outaouai with 8642.
The large Montréal region is also familiar with its stock of pancakes with nearly 7,000 private current rooms in the metropolis and Laval.
Do you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net benefits projections to increase and hopes for record results through Australian and United Kingdom vacationers.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a subsidizing benefit over the entire period between 325 and 340 M before tax, against a previous forecast of 305 to 315 M.
If current projections are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the recorded benefit of $290.4 M in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of its benefits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are in a good way to achieve record results on the whole of the year before deduction of interest and tax," he said.
This is about Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the most profitable countries.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector doubled during the second half of the year, which allowed a domestic market for low-cost business travel.
Also in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
The United States branch recovered its losses during the first half of which the seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire period for the third time thereafter.
Flight Centre's operations have increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people come to a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown strangers opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an appearance of wantle with licensed wages.
The investigators took the flight, specified the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, General of Police Abdul Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army defeated Islamic President Mohammed Morsi early in July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a modern British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A combined course of literature and English language will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must tomorrow publish its new programmes of English and maths – the first materials for radical review.
It will continue to make changes in other essentials in the coming year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Reviews Board, will develop a reorganization of the structure of the GCSE, with a new notation system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our public confidence review system", stressing that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students from Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more time to maths than time, close sources of coalition government indicated that the GCSE of deep-rooted maths – as well as the greater importance given to materials in international classrooms – would probably encourage schools to provide more courses.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial maths.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in that State and extending the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.

The head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his track, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the director of the German Memorial of Resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bill.
Müller didn't survive at the end of the war.
"My body was buried in 1945 in a joint fortress of the Berlin-Mitte Jewish cemetery," he made sure that it was on a large day-to-day drawing by relying on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great events of the Post-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, were also provided during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bill.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"In August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a command," said Mr. Tuchel.
He wore "a general uniform."
"In the inner pocket on the left there were, inter alia, its service status with a photo," he continued.
Image also publishes a document from the district of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sadiques is buried in a Jewish cemetery, which is an enormous taste.
"The memory of the victims is a huge crowd of people," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He attended the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and, in particular, under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the end of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Balle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bülle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, although 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Balle is one of the 10 CNN Heros in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the "Heros CNN of the year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bälle looked at his sick father to change the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and return to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Balle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first, he had just a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematom that he was going to carry for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Walle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Balle spent years accompanying his father in hospitals and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bülle.
You can leave home at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Balle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure is carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Balle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing her father and so many of her compatriots suffering, Dr. Balle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bülle and his volunteer team have performed more than 700 surgeries free of charge during the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé's central hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they set foot in trucks after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing hard terrain to get to the villages that are most in need of help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They have once again had to push vehicles across river or rough tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroism: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Balle – with his great smile and his relaxing energy – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
“ We receive 500 people every visit, ” said Mr. Bülle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come to their feet.
In this travel hospital, various health care is produced.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bicycles, a couple of lunar sets or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practice team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, a store or a house; after the intervention the patient rises up and returns to the bedroom to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the clarification of the electronic group, the operating room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Bwell and his volunteers work until the first hours of the morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
“ They hit on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue working, ” said Mr. Balle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge during the past year, and he knows that their presence can make the difference for those who come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undertaken to care for a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living in this hospital and working as a hospital surgeon, Dr. Balle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's there," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Balle's group.
He's always at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwell in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn the field they do not have.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help shed blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Balle," said Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're studying medicine in the second year.
Volunteer students generally travel to Cameroon, often with medical material collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and education are carried out by Dr. Balle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to go away.
For Dr. Bülle, the relatively constant load of work is not a problem.
Helping others to live happy lives by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” added Mr. Belle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain is the reasons why I do it.

The two France de Pierre Nora
Perplexes, the universities have long been hard to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in Amphitheaters and course rooms?
No doubt, but stressing its weakness for the paths of passage, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrary of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard street office?
In fact, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heritier of the Fraud who cares about Fontelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred oil could not be replaced by true holy oil, the one of the the thesis that happened.
They recognized him as a great observer, an animator and federalist of their work, but noting that he was less inclined to produce it himself.
In this uncertain picture the monument of "Memory places", which he attached to his name, has also contributed.
The evil language was able to see a giant market at the peaks, presented by an intelligent commenter, with a live cut of eye and earring, but still attractive.
The two works published by Nora here for nearly two years have already established that the one who did not write had much and good writing.
The book here should definitely make him fair.
However, once again, there is the temptation of housing, intellectual exercise, the jubilation to jump as a joint foot from one subject to another.
But it is soon understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book to such a fine title give the brochure one and the same passion: to discover the constitutional nuance of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: it's a concern of time.
Here we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a temporary essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the business, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one behind Pierre Nora is everything else.
It does not inherit an eternal franchise, it refuses to define.
An analyst worried about a family weirdity, error in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by an object in the form of a rapist, tormented by disturbing questions.
What is this, which is born from the company itself: why, in a country if it is permanently installed within its borders, if it is formerly responsible and strongly trained, do these dramatic appeals to unity be heard?
They are not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, just to confuse the problem or dispute of French history.
Frances and Gaulais, Armagnacs and Burguignos, Catholics and Protestants: the divisions, here, are very old.
And, of course, the most impressive is the one that falls into both national history.
In view of the Sixties of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarch and the other revolutionary.
The second sought the death of the first but not to reach the nest; he was concerned about finding the sanctuary and much more vulnerable to unity and indivisibility than he had cut his head to the one who was evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a nation that is inviolablely binary, divided between left and right, hypocrisy and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagone, although the American expedition of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one revolution and one revolution, a declaration of rights, wants to establish a new society.
But American coaching makes it better to focus on what we are.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men buried in an ancient Indian regime, and much more radical.
There's a consensual revolution when she's here sowing the drama and trust.
There are fundamental fathers who are always honored, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are punished for making models, and who are from the rest of us.
There is an institutional situation, and here is a set of constitutions, such as both errors of recovery and attempts to recover.
France's going, France's coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed that they could recover from their history and win the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, the central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even concern: by welcoming those who are then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the students everything in ancient France clearly prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only been for a while.
This voice is again discussed in the debate, which is voiced by a new type of immigration, threatened by the number of required minorities, which is absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes on and the magnificent view of France that comes.
First of all, the story's portrait, which should book some surprises.
There we find out that the fireplace was a casino.
The man of multiple curiosity turned slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The stone miner was located in the center.
And the one who had deposited, this is over a half century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had been eliminated in the initial exercise of the thesis, we are confident, like grano sallis, that he will end up doing it.
Some in a less radical, more elegant and more subtle form.
But we don't lie, all of us too.
Because more than the figure imposed by the university course, this theme tells us the internal need for a life.
An old reception in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
On March 8, 1986, Jean-Louis Normandin was released on November 27, 1987, with three members of his team from "Antenne 2" in Beyrouth.
Retired since 2008, he has participated in the creation of the World Cup Association for Defence, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for the hostages to complain and bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
More than 1,000 days later, the four Aborigines of Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Greße Wednesday afternoon, they were able to find their families.
And just try to resume their life course.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former rapporteur, retired since 2008, the president of the Association "World Otages".
On the night of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm free, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes it black - Roger Auque.
He says "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very inclined too.
This is the war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They're putting us on the table of a trolley.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
From France we are being sent to France's embassy.
It's time for the first cuts to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
I've given you a shot at France's embassy.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marciani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrive there in helicopters, we are taken by a private plane that rescues us in France through Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua is aboard.
How did your arrival on the French soil happen?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible butcher.
And a lot of media.
When I was on my side there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The decline of the plane ladder, my son-in-law and my parents, my friend, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many cars follow our car that Roussin drives.
The modems pull out the storm to make photos and follow me to the house where I have to do some police to prevent some of them from getting up.
Mediatic pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're very happy to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to make it clear.
We get out of a hole and we're all stuck under the media fires.
It's a bit complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 20:00, the next day I'm on the TV.
Then a sort of rehabilitation to life begins, very slowly, for one or two months which are a little like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been carried out?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corse.
The rest was done in Val-de-Thank you for the days following my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
This is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remember him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with information services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It was logical.
I didn't find it.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I hear what's said.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things bother me, others less.
I am trying to do the part of the issues between my past as a hostage and my cascade of president of the "World's Otages" association that allows me to distance myself from it, and I feel much more interested in addressing it.
For example, I ask myself about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify for "political" arrest warrants - which is the case most of the time - and to allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, the whole world is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for this.
Why would it not be said to the hostages "You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimate, hit with a good sense.
This message is heard, but I don't listen, and it's shocking to me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to deplore Morsi's process
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the president's trial, Mohamed Morsi, they were down in the streets.
A movement throughout Egypt to claim the re-establishment of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a process that emphasizes this militarist of the Muslim Brothers.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi who is intended to judge Sisi, not against it.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Adverse events in Alexandria, the police used larymogene gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohammed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel appealed to 9 American States to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexuality, "all military partners have the right to an identity card of the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with", the Minister in New York recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League against Anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to deliver these cards to couples of the same sex in the national Guard facilities" which they have implemented on their territory, he said, accusing these States of violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary for Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-State front began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implementation of the Texane National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texane Act and the Federal Act on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a high defence officer.
The Pentagone estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5600 active persons, including the National Guard, the Reserve and the Retirement.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard took place this Saturday, November 2, at the park Skate in Hyères.
The competition, organized by the SK8 Unit of the Bimp Association, should group the best scanners in the region.
The registrations are taken on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification stages will begin in the pack at 10 a.m. before the end scheduled for 15 a.m. and the award until 16 a.m..
The public will be able to admire the technical advances of young people who, for some, are already in high-level competitions, at the expense of young Hierarchy Lorenzo Palumbo.
For only 10 years, he has already won his place for European championships in Copenhagen this year, and he does not like to show up to competitors who are more than three heads.
The mayor of Toronto's hunting reporters came to ask him about a drug deal
In Canada, Toronto's mayor is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media.
A video of justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested one, Rob Ford, has always not consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
This day, he broke away from his property by several journalists came to question him.
We also think that at times the images do not need an explanation or a comment.
A rare case detected in a chat in Val-d'Oise
On Thursday, 31 October, the authorities announced that a case of radiation had been detected in a chattel in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France had been responsible for indigenous cases since 2001.
The Chatton was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The radiation diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and charge people who could have contacted this chat between 8 October and 28 October," states the Ministry of Health and Agriculture.
"Five persons who have been in contact with the chatton have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"To man, the preventive treatment of the human race, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communication said.
The departments are now calling on persons who would have been killed, raped, raped, or injured on a mucus or on a skin that had been injured by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with that cat between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"Since 2001, France has been imported from another country, not taxed," the report said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last reported "autochton" case of rabies goes back to December 1998 on a survey and that "France is officially declared liable for this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported Chinese had been registered in 2008.

Obama walks back on his reform of the health system
Under an allegation of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his promise without any ambiguity and often repeated according to which “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it”.
After hundreds of thousands of people had received notice of the resolution of their suppliers, the Republicans criticized the President during the last few days on charges of fraud against the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The great majority of people holding health insurance that they deserve can keep," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an expertise in the current" in the area of settlement, President Obama urged the Americans who received this advice to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain full and better health schemes at the same price, even less expensive than planned.
"You're going out winning," he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if 5 per cent of the people who are self-insurance were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address myself directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius when he witnessed to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had been "admissive".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I had to restore your trust.
It is an ex-expressed Kathleen Sebelius who spoke this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, a representative of the Republican of Missouri, to know if she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has stopped insisting on Ms. Sebelius' "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up on the government-led insurance to sign a scheme via HealthCare.gov, which now has been available to millions of Americans.

He was invited to follow Abou Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore be seen near the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel had to carry this box on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that there will be another special box on Sunday, for the course, to mark its 4th consecutive global title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launchs his part of the bathroom
We don't lie.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Part of the whale" is not only addressed to the whalebirds.
I've chosen a letter from France as a logo, justify it.
When I talk about bathing, I address all those who are excluded from the large national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in its native Aubervilliers community, from being more willing to defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting can be characterized primarily by all districts.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Department of Multiculturalism, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, is now reselled as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
In 2002 he joined Jean-Pierre Chevénement, then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I miss in my programme are attached to the left, but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them and follow them.
There's only extreme parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built its program -consultable on the Internet - from many topics intended to talk to the bathroom residents, including young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the 16-year-old civil majority, the rehabilitation of the property guard...
There are still candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this risk of being fair is recognized."
It's a matter of time and money.
The bathing party should even be represented in Auberviliers through my application and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven lists in Metropolitical France and Martinique.
"And the e-mails of support I have received since yesterday don't give up all of the bathrooms," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, not previously, that the American spying was "too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry pointed out a reduction in the defence attitude of the United States towards its monitoring programmes by acknowledging that, on several occasions, the spying was "too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had managed on "automatic pilot" when he saw a series of fire-examination revelations from public prosecutor Edward Snowden about NASA's spying activities.
The refugees placed the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is unthinkable that the President, myself and other members of the government had been aware of some things in automatic pilot mode since we had the opportunity, since the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-level member of the United States Government to admit that the American spying had exceeded the burden, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He stated: "In some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to those who are now undergoing a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted on the fact that NSA was a well-functioning force and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, explosive them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We were well and well stopped from falling aircraft, explosives and killing people because we were able to learn facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will return to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American spying business and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the vice-chairman of the Senate on European affairs explained yesterday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had experienced regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration caused by the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combat terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and the Vice-Commission of European Affairs of the United States of America at a meeting since Washington.
And I'm going to go back to Europe to help them understand that we must continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that NSA has caught millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, but the Agency's director said this week that it was unfair and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about the metadata that NATO alliances had collected and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures were made of documents published by Snowden that the NSA had received data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other Heads of State.
The director of information services, James Clapper, justified the spying of the alliances by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a current practice on both sides.
In this turbulent atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of the two parties and two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be distinguished in the future.
He indicated that the interior was still to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "harmful firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do the spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to return this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the heartbreak generated by the American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the United States monitoring activities.
The London Bourse was established on Thursday, followed by the bad results of Shell and the following announcement by the Federation of Maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian Appeals for his imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for alleged torture by a taxi driver, appealed to the court and was released.
First, Steve Rochelle Bamford was convicted by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were mastering it, attacked him on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police questioned Bamford for two days before she invented the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commission cell before hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in Phuket's Periphery rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League ofrugby Peter Tunks, who called the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very worried" about her daughter's welfare and wanted her to go to Australia.
“ We’ve obviously had a stressful time, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible, ” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed to the trial and was released after a $50,000 bail.
In Australia, the press said that while waiting, she was on vacation in the region of Krabi, south of Thailand.
Thai legal sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they suggested that the appeal could lead to a summary of the punishment that could last up to two years of imprisonment and imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket by Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to round up its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to acquisition.

Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeois School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeois school commission, 62% of the students have a native language other than French.
That's what motivated parents, students, teachers and members of education staff a year ago to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horses between different cultures.
The school commission has just announced its vision of "Living together in French".
The vision of diversity has been taking place for a year in schools to help students of all origins discover common records that are not limited to French.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are repertoires.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're dry or come from others.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are created in such a way that they are identified in all of this," explains the President of Vision of Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school commission.
"For example, on the transmission of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations that we live in, within the student client," he said.
The Marguerite-Burgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, also come from other sources.
Rachida Azdouz, from Montreal University, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"The different educational strategies, that's the real need," she said.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its English: language, school, social and cultural.
