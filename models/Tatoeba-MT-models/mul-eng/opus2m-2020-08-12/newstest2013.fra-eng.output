A Republican strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the fire.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took place a long time after the November 2010 elections, which were to be added to 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require that voters present a photo identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods by precipitation, invalidate the right to be registered as an electorate on the day of the trial and withdraw the citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian Act.
The Republican authorities are committed to extending this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring draft laws in 34 States to force voters to submit a photo identity card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
On the other hand, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity card.
A lot more.
Students, elected voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, twelve states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the Spanish vote.
It is clear, however, that two Spanish electors in three favour the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in 2011 abolishing the registration of electors on the day of polling in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to be enrolled.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009, however, have reduced the number of new voters to 17 per cent in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by anticipation.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the State electors.
He went with the Spaniards.
These represented only 11 per cent of voters, but 24 per cent of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites that formed 76 per cent of the electors represented only 46 per cent of the electors voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting electoral registration.
Several bill projects have been blocked by the vetos of democratic rulers.
The general lawyer of the United States has been involved in suspending the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit part of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the introduction of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules set out will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
The democratic criticisms deplore the partial nature of the laws that have been voted and are clearly aimed at influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the election to win the presidency.
It is too soon to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer test: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes produce wrong results, with negative or even negative results, resulting in useless medical interventions.
What to do more to make men who are already reluctant to pass tests.
Whether to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among Witness groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a test and those who did not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up of 12 years, that there are between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not wasted.
So I recommend testing from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
The men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other people who are inhospitable.
It is true that the patient needs to understand the risk of his cancer by offering him the options possible, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not lead to long-term life, and instead opting for active disease monitoring in these cases.
Today, many people who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
They will be suggested for active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
In addition, the criteria for determining who should or should not be treated are clearly defined.
So I recommend that even if I pass the test.
But it is important to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool that allows for and against the APS test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," notes André Beaulieu, a Canadian Cancer Society spokesman.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a big night for people's health.
"Today, Encore, there are 1.5 million smokes in Quebec," laments the spokesman André Beaulieu.
This is encouraging: 10 years after quit smoking, the risk of dying from a drop in cancer.
Weight
Embonpointing and obesity also promote the presence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophageal, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," it adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much quantity, it reduces the risks of reaching a colorectal cancer.
Carrots too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the organism's cells and lead to cancer development," he explained.
The vitamins
Over the last few years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase instead.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is clearly no longer established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family background with his doctor.
"To pass a test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs decorated box
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson created all the excitement, the last summer, and for reason.
It is believed that this boss is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then it's the last part where the existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "better" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's not completely sure that it's good for Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we have a genuine new particular, and that it looks very much like the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a large physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume it's all right about Higgs, because the chances of cheating seem less, and see what it is about.
In this low world, there is a fatally inconceivable law that wants two things not to be found in the same place at the same time.
You can't break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even though the physical nature of the particles is a very strange world, it appears that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which provides that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state" - this "state" consisting of large modo in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens called farms, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, it's the bosses, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be beautiful and well located at the same time.
These boons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, etc.) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the moons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature are propagating and the Boone of Higgs would be in some kind of appearance.
These boons, we need to highlight them here, are not all as exotic as we can believe.
In fact, if you can read this journal, it is thanks to a box of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particular with an accelerated electrical charge or a change of direction, it "darks" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, slightly like a boiler launched into a station.
From this "degradation" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, or from infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force porters" boxes.
Field more stable
It goes also with the Higgs boson, in this difference close to another field, the Higgs field, which must be "dark" so that this boson appears.
But this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to highlight it, it needs to reach very, very high energy, a little as if it were a ice-cream where only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That is why a huge acceleration of particles such as the CERN - the Great Hadron Collider is an analog of 27 km of conference! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, nor all materials, are actually interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never wear himself on a frigo.
And in the same way, these are not all individuals that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, keep them) do not.
Now, what is it that "can bring" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine the difference between MS's observations and predictions.
They are also a number of people who wish to be found because the smallest difference could open a door on a "new physical" and blow some pieces of the Model.
This must be said, there are still huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (ups!) or shadow matter, which forms around 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on Mr and Mrs Tout-le-World's everyday life are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Keep in mind: At the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories had no doubt about the revolution that their work was about to begin.
They interviewed scientific applications, but none of them remained.
In fact, we have already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who set himself up the first continuous laser (the first one was pushed) in 1962 - at the start of the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget".
Can not open message
And then, applications can also come from all instruments surrounding the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle set up a small light capturer in 1969 during his optical work.
This capturer, although not of its original intention, now serves as "eye" to all the world's digital cameras, and has appreciated the 2009 physics Nobel.
This does not necessarily mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that we never know...
Palliative Care - The best way to die... ► The Debor
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must take place shortly after a draft law is drawn up.
But in this important area, there is much to be done.
Debor tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that robbed him had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, mi-figue mi-rasin, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois's Palliative Care House, in Beloeil, where he arrived at the guard.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from returning to toilets alone and even eating alone.
Satisfied before an appetizer breakfast, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, redesigned.
Courageously, he even comes to laugh, talking to strangers around him, bringing his medications to him, offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In our lives, we learn that a man, this fish's starting off," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's house.
Regressing to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the person ' s ability to accept regression, see.
Because, from the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care, there are great moments when even this regression takes place in the heart.
Patients entering the home of the Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the " team of doctors and nurses who are around them are no longer providing care called " curatives " .
For Ms. A., 89, the most feared is to die " conscious and excited " .
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help him breathe.
She still looks forward to her last visit from her son from Italy in the following days.
In Victor-Gadbois, we are produced with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
These are palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small when we know we're all done dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death, we will accept oral care from Brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Last night, we used a beer at Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it's his son who'll end the beer at the feet of the dead man.
"We help the neighbors as well as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois's house, the days follow but they don't look like them.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who knows his last family assembly in the court, well closed in his ears while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old young man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," she is concerned by Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois's home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It has been said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a disease reaches the final phase of their life, whether at home, at the hospital or at home.
And a number of organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois's house and the Big Montréal Palliative Care Society, are more or less exclusively specialized in cancer care.
This is precisely the great lack in Quebec's health care which threatens several doctors specialised in palliative care the adoption of a law involving euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed summaries of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circulating to prove their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted into euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to calm her down.
I'm afraid that patients don't ask to die because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
Helène Richard's prospects for survival were already minimal when she left a test chemical treatment.
When I announced to my uncle that I would stop treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was done!
No strong care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients who ask for death are grateful that nurses have not responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely potent in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Palliative Care Society at the Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
For the rest of your life, doctors have often resorted to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep with the patient until his death, either in a sporadic manner or permanently.
We can no longer do as if we do not understand this part of suffering.
In addition, the disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not calmed say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to get out of my way," which means "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was made possible through a press release from Canada's Health Research Institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists of the Italian mafia are told every day what they know of a powerful "system" like the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafiososo.
A " industry " which has been very expensive to Quebec contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has been working since we took the great means," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a former police chief in Quebec and Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal has emerged in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the abuses of road labour contracts in Quebec, where the first liberal minister of the period, Jean Charest, had only agreed to retreat.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, private financing of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010, he stressed that the only Ministry of Transport would have spent a billion dollars on contracts," some referring to their instincts to touch a share!
The Carbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will "show the strategists behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More officers of the "Marteau Scouade" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "goose cartel" to put the soft pedal on the contract charges...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting a series of investigations and has brought accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a state-of-the-art bathroom.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city in Quebec.
It is suspected that there are over-repetition powers in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers in the way of Montreal and Italian original entrepreneurs, including Tony Accursso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" for the acquisition of public contracts.
He himself paid 3 per cent of the value of contracts received in Montreal to an intermediate related to the mafia that returned money to Union Montréal, part of Major Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito contributed cash in the year 2000, giving over $88,000 Canadians (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals, at the same time.
He had also organized an illegal fund collection for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalia Normandeau.
Contracts of Egouts which are subject to the costs
In Montreal, the corruption system was functioning around.
Gilles Surprising, ex-inhibitor of public works, has given him a good detail before the Commission: in ten years, he has received gifts construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and winepots totaling $736 000, in exchange for cost contracts of egouts.
Other Voyage officials reported that they had been using a 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the invoices by extra miscellaneous means.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his pockets with salt money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, pushing Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montréal's first choice to pull out the alarm sound.
Mother of the rounding of River-des-Prairies, on the east of the island, has since 2010 been vying against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% cash sale in electoral campaigns
Of the survey that will finally be put in place, she said that "it is on a line to understand the functioning of the system, embedded by forms, to stop the gangrene and push the phantoms".
The process, she says, "is painful but positive."
We are cleaning the beach, but we need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so that we do not come back with questionable practices.
How we get married.
All right.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the elite in the course of the strike," when they didn't panic in the mob!
Estimating 70% of the share of money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that this was just a set of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the contributions to the parties to $100, but this will not change it, he says: "As long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be political money."
He proposes a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go down anymore; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story contains the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who wish to look at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken a new look at the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual conscience but also by the new size of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't get caught.
From my beginning at the INFO Clearfontaine Preformation Centre on my way to Saint-Etienne, I've always progressed by pallets.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to dispute high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He's fired by supporters like Claude Makelele, who played at the same post as me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today it is not equal in League 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with jump clubs.
He's got a lot of great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the lead.
But we're in trouble.
One of our major objectives is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8 finals in the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We tried to go as far as possible.
Now everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say to very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish our chicken first in front of Porto so we can receive at the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and be enrolled in time.
Today, that's not the case.
Finally, the PSG provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In Ligue 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big mistake?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really going to wear this champion title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May there was disappointment as we had the qualities to end first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media wait too long for the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us from what has been invested and from the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we get 4-0 at home against Troyes and there's still things to blame us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We ask what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built with time.
We've proven in League of Champions that we could answer these questions.
Look at Manchester City that has not been able to qualify for the final 8s since two months, they have also made huge expenditures!
With regard to investments, we imagined you with 15 points forward to the tree!
It was to ignore our opponents and the champion of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have done it.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
So much better than it's said there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has many goals.
He's come for this and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This moves others to make their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows the world to move forward.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my pain prevented me from wasting my time in the game.
I've seen things out there and I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good selection matches.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behavior today.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the World Qualifications Group.
The selectioner is strict, close to players, and inspires winning.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) set up on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for the world.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties involved.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pair files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded using 15 000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept cookies as gifts or as means of payment.
The Bitcoin course, after reaching a $30 (€23) summit in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around $10 (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitively with the dollar or euro" and "like to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other types of virtual money like "credits", used to progress in a video game that we get by playing or that we can buy it (and sometimes change it back).
The social Facebook network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that changed bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, such as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hack phase, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hasher" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular impression (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily check that it's good.
The transaction is therefore indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the impression.
If one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be valid by the network - the other one orpheline because they have different pressures.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to up to one hundred million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also due to each increase in the ability to calculate.
There have already been high and low levels of network life.
Web sites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked and Bitcoins have been stolen.
"The error used does not apply to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also makes money laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But the case also has this defect.
Weight players like Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "genital soldiers" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," he said, "Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who becomes gold bitcoins.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages more of its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the markets, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photographer and acknowledge", precise by Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement of discharge due to hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose, but 2013 could be a tournament," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, if this money is successful.
We're part of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapasi and Surobi).
The Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghan countries that we have punished as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban are foreign extremists, former leaders refugees in Pakistan, but often foreign-armed countries, such as the Soviets' time.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by Jesuits, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.
Tolerance, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, will no longer be the case when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with French credits, was done in order.
Cars and blind trains joined Kabul without being attacked, surrounded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban departure on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistibility from 1994 to 1996.
Thus, Kabul was empty, the country of fire and blood as a result of the struggle between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the blindness of these countries beyond the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former Moudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban governments join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The major notables of the Anti-Soviet War came into force in 2001.
They died as businessmen, taking government lands to sell them into lands to build refugees who came from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They are condemned; most of them no longer fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, are attracted to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the vast US: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have shared the modern world in their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
Work should be given to these young people who no longer want to return to the obscenity of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are front-ends of portable telephones; the television, and its Turkish leaves that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, mountain countries, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular when the elections are scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid for the past 50 years.
No industry has been removed on its way, no barrier is in place, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country that has been devastated by war for thirty years, government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was found that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that the Westerns were there just to take care of them.
Without energy to treat on-the-spot iron or copper minerals, or means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak copper mine, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dump the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employees of the province.
It will also take one day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to review normal reports.
The start of the French fighting forces ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: school of girls, boys, department of French at the University, French Institute, military cooperation, legal, medical and agricultural, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cicic) 'Cimic' (Cimic) 'Cim') has been trying to "get the hearts and minds' and carry out the impossible task of harmonizing aid and action, and has led to the success of a small French NGO, a number of work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, local gourmans, have helped to contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and growth of cropable areas.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The embassy received dozens of written applications from small agricultural achievements coming from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be free from the insurership of foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, they should maintain in their favour a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid.
A Constitution for the Forces in Egypt
It's a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provides it with its provisional powers, it has decided to play its full role.
Taking around the world, he announced Wednesday that the constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
Within just two years, Egypt has relied on a provisional text, several times it has been amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal abuses.
This new initiative has only made the country more fragile.
For his opponents, the President continues in his "autocratic delire", continuing to "trembling his word" and "holding the right".
On the other hand, it is ensured that it is a means of ending it as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time period that forces the brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy while the debate is going on throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with American Time weekly.
As long as this appeal to a precipitate vote holds the ultimate to the people of Egypt: "You vote for my text or I keep the full powers," they must be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a foreign environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, the majority of Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most of the liberarians were missing the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, noting that they had not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, replacement members, were added to the heat tomorrow morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
No wonder it is the most common unanimity that the articles have been voted for.
Comments were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences in the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constitution was wrong.
The text, which was still voting yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all the attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, providing that "the principles of caria are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the "the establishment of Islamic law" is a major claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a matter of their good will and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answered the Liberals, who only see a cut of communication.
For they believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They aim, inter alia, at article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular to verify compliance with the laws with the charia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying that "the people called are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also compounded by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now there is no concrete religious involvement.
This Constitution remains within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not extremists but university students, for some of them formed in the French system," writes Alexis Blueet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits "there may be an ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed are used to print on the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisdiction, etc.].
And the question may arise in the future to what extent civil judges are competent to speak up."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are quite reduced in comparison with what they were under the old regime.
Other litigation: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civil proceedings will be prohibited in military courts, as the human rights defence associations have requested.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, which they consider liberality.
The crime of blasphem is maintained and the abuse is now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article makes no further reference to the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the President of Egypt was to speak on television yesterday evening, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
Support from the Head of State will spread them, Saturday.
In Israel, sacred places, the World Centre and a Samurai Sea await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the abundance of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Facty has held five major reasons for your return to Israel.
Share in the Worship of the Holy Place
Be sure that you are inconsistency: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever paints these "baptismal funds" will be affected by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus ’ miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus goes on water, where he suffers from storms or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this very place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers travel the Road of the Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the predecessor), where the process took place, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the Peter of the Nation and to the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world, a symbol of mankind's salvation, is located.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is raised to the place where the tree was grown to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of the Lamentation which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A. J.-C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then uttered.
Move Up
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, an ancient refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 Av. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the rocky rocks of a height of 450 m above sea level.
Only the amateurs of alpineism can make it through their own means.
For others, a telepheric emmenses them on this full-time summit.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 metres high, the ski station of Mount Hermont is located, which welcomes many tourists during the winter.
A boat can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit them all during one day.
Here are the five most interesting things that really hurt.
First of all: the Israeli Museum located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It opens the very old Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel-Aviv Art Museum.
There are mainly the impressionists' and expressionists' toilets Montet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths composed of mollusks of visitors and spectators of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin sculptures.
There's no guide or memory store.
The entry is free and the gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memory, built in memory of 1.5 million children spent in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter there and penetrate into a total darkness.
It's brilliant stars.
You then understand the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they are dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three great Israeli balney stations are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year.
In this respect, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupys the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The gold-coloured water contains moisture and very easily retains bananas, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are of a surrealist beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt, lemon, curative buds and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply stop.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are preserved by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of Antiquity.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persia saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived even a long and happy life.
Tourists particularly like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will laugh at you.
In Jaffa you can cross young married people who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can dance in the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the Croissians.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to Tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is best to prefer the dollars to the euro, since they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now $1 is equal to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, these are mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a rapid tramway and Haifa has the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and capable of relieving the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funnel.
The route in all modes of transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes at 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition meant to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening at sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts tomorrow morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only the household food, which excludes pig, sea fruits, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of dishes based on corn and eggs, soups and desserts based on coco milk but also the humous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, small beans of moulus, falafels, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nutrient chats that extend the air today.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of the cars.
These falcons love the places that go through and they don't just refuse them.
The rental of a car varies from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry into the cost museum on average 30 shekels.
The Language of the Digits
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
It was mainly people who came to travel and take refuge in the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists returned to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, or 51% more than in 2010, before the visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"This language has gone to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights soldiers are complaining about what the mandatory language test law will do, counterfeiters who sell "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are Central Asian origins: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and provides that each migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sales sector.
However, in time the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, knowledge of language will need to be validated, but also that of the History of Russia and the Foundations of Law.
It will need to validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its working permit.
Only the nationals of the countries where Russia has the official language status are excluded.
Persons who received training certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitudes and protection of rights
The review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the People's Association University, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to conduct examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This review initiative was supported by MEPs and the Federal Migration Service.
Before the law enters into force, however, human rights defenders have asked many times in the press: what will this bring?
What will the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migrant service will be able to reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many talk about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will enable 90 per cent of foreign workers to solve their problems.
The problems are for migrants without vocational training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev's certificate, the future migrant is intended to cross people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded home where he and dozens of his likes will be tortured for months without food and paper and will have to climb between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken by their passport, and they don't touch the expected wage," confirmed the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migrant service in Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many people from Central Asian republics who want to gain money in Russia believe that they not only know the language of the country where they want to go but also write it with difficulty in their own language.
This is certainly not their fault, but their fault: a few Turkmen, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can allow themselves to follow that would be only a passive primary teaching.
In fact, their families don't even have to feed their children without telling them to dress them properly and equip them for school.
Since they're in their early teens, these young people are going to win money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when we don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel reduced and loved."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without a status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Come or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of money legislation: between 12 and 16 miles of theft.
And then we can get a wrong record fast for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, where cases of exorbitance are.
"They're asking us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, tea," he told journalists Oumed Khowchkadamov, from Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't slow down and buy you a nice work of art"
Since the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it has been found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be wrong.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by federal migrant workers.
False paper comes out of an ordinary printable color.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the examinations had to draw up seven thousand scrolls for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper bags".
The authorities may grant migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time examination to follow language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
Some of the crimes involving legal weapons are very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tolerate the law against civil arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was shootings committed at marriages or murder organized by Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, who committed seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of ballasts in the public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit for the port of arms by 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Security and Combating Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the Douma of the State shortly.
The whole world is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "close the eye".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, are demanding to leave "this insensitivity".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, stated to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and a crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from providing themselves to the black market.
According to them, any weapon for a reasonable price can be found in Moscow today.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the office
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are the number of five, according to Victor Barantes, Colonel for Retirement who has served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot taken from a gun command site
The first is "the military track", i.e. the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of black market weapons are those that are captured by criminals by the forces of the order.
Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen from the police and stolen directly from the police forces.
The illegal pistols are sold from military warehouses.
Many of these people have often suffered explosions.
"The certified versions indicate that some fires have been fired to resolve the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and are disarming on the black market, particularly in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is the contradiction.
An important part of guns and ammunition comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artificially, a mafia formed and organized supply," adds the former military.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts assessed the approach of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Studies for Public Administration.
Experts have analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and the forces of order.
Half of the weapons presented on the black market were found "on the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons", explained the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from military conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 per cent are stolen from "clandesties".
A salesman and consultant of an armory who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that no one has ever been able to buy the weapons found by these clandestine people; they are too old.
Most often, he says, salesmen will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person who buys by means of a unit, for example a TT gun.
We'll let him go through the merchandise with a grill.
"He transports it in town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two carriers," he says.
"It is true that the police are at the forefront of all affairs, so when crimes are about to be eradicated, it takes control of illegal arms markets," adds the seller.
"Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are generally found by means of knowledge.
I have visited sites, blogs, until a kind of guy shows up and proposes to come to the Begovaya station where someone should take me to a "coin" to walk.
The gun price, I've been given it on site.
Victor Barantes in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, tell the seller, I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salesmen on the markets, but there's also a need to come there by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a couple of American points with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The young are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military officer Victor Barantes tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he says, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album where there was "all we wanted".
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranet, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't like buying, go with the forest vendor and set a target.
"When I'm let out and when I'm sure the gun goes well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
The search engines show the sites and groups on Vkontakte where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
To that end, we do not need any document or person to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," was posted in advertising on the site "Buying a gun or a fight missile."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're selling children?
"Unauthorized, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of false sites and has gathered people who want to buy weapons of war.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves enjoying carbon in Siberia.
Victor Barantes, observer and former military
I heard about this kind of scheme: the site is generally registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make payment on automatic charges.
"He gets back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explained the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Barantes says that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of false sites and has gathered people who want to buy weapons of war.
"People fall on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves enjoying carbon in Siberia," he said.
A Macarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearms weapon, dear to experts, can cost between $100 and 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to an Arm" association, we can buy a Macarov gun for $100-300.
He'll have to wait about a month and a half.
Long-term deposits resulting from the management of these medium-sized deposits.
According to official data from the Department, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes decreased by 7 per cent in Russia and increased by 22.9 per cent, while the cases of armed robbery and explosions, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8 per cent.
U.S.: employees of fast food and supermarkets are under arrest
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a caste job at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been raised against the low wages practised by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast-paced restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take its breadth or disappear quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of left associations.
At the same time as the increase in modest salaries that receive basic wages in Walmart and in fast restoration channels, the organizers of the demonstrations want to obtain trade unions.
This sector is not for the moment covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Friday Black", when a devastating flood of money swept millions of inhabitants across America and sometimes swept away from the squalls.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their job to organize pickups with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: layers of hunting rifles through car batteries, aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many paid salaries at Walmart do their courses only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can be allowed to sell its products on the market, including due to low wages from his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of high-carriots or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Vendredi black" exhibitions demanded an increase in pay, and they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's basic salary that affects $9.5 per hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary by $12 per hour, it would cost $3.2 billion.
It's 1.1% more than it's currently spending.
If Walmart would transfer all the increase in wages on consumer savings, each course in the store would pay them 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 a year more than now.
Walmart's parties are pleased to note that protests took place in only nine States and did no harm to the group.
The "Vendredi black" continued in the stores at 8:00 a.m. the following evening and Walmart sold 5000 articles in this period to the second.
Its cash flows have carried out 100 million transactions for the "Vendredi Black".
The company's spokesman Dan Fogleman ensured in an interview at Huffington Post's left-hand site that at least five Walmart's employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "computer operation" on the part of the organizer union.
"Next Client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and no longer involved Walmart shops (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other restaurants are well placed.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then they don't even give you sick leave and you don't pay for the work you did honestly!
Jumanee Williams, member of New York Municipal Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided by federal legislation and New York's wage is $7.25 per hour.
The fast food increases with time, but the average of its basic employees is $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this town.
For me it's unthinkable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living at home with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I am able to interview McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal's forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, or more than twice as much as the current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be established in the fast-resurrection sector.
The U.S. Act prohibits the administration from banning them and imposing on protesters a union by brigades or licences.
However, administration rarely simplifys their lives.
For a union, comparison of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons.
One of the mains is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other disturbing demonstrations were held near several other fast restoration channels.
The moment of protest was the mid-day gathering near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including Jumane Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then they don't even give you sick leave and you don't pay for the work you have done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New Yorkese Democrats in view of, inter alia, by the candidate at Major Bill De Blasio who said that "we all have to support the employees of the fast restoration so that they can obtain a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New Yorkis deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this demonstration as the most important one that has known the fast restoration sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there without realizing that not all were fast-food wages, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
For the moment it is difficult to say if this mass movement kitten will be small.
"For the moment, we only arrive by means of trampling the brain"
Finally, the fans of new technologies are accustomed to seeing the increased reality through special highlights.
At the beginning, it was Google who released this summer’s current model at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had made the request for the letter.
However, it comes from maintenance with the director of the 3D interacting group of 3D technologies at the Microsoft de Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, which for the scientists of this company, the moonlights are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in cloudy air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and we try to extend the boundaries of this interaction at the same time.
Humanity as a whole remains for the moment in pixels on the flat screen and sometimes in touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and become radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect capturers are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the management.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has performed physical interaction, many things occur on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The acquisition of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance for the moment is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get out of the computer world in our, in the physical world, to make it more attractive.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space around it.
Thus we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start with, let's get rid of these stupid pieces of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocal command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality is because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its nest.
For example, in order to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we are pensioning for gestures, not broad gestures, but for discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by an arm attached to the hand that recorded the movements of the oss and muscles.
It is now big, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a view.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's it?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'll do it with word and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it'll be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think we should work very closely to develop new types of sensors that will help us better identify human reactions.
It can be done, for example, by laser capturers, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
If you're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect captures, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it's on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but the quality of matrix and depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which increases the work of algorithms designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for management.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the receivers a regular delay of treatment including between 1 and 100 μs, the current receivers are closer to the second value (60-100).
The whole world does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames at the second.
But shouldn't the number of cameras increase?
- The Kinect has three cameras today, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other one, a receiver of the thought signal.
And the third camera is actually a typical catcher in the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or use it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar soft product in Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help to define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft did not present his lunches to the public at Google's discretion.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, the moonlights are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical but this is what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitor" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass off the laptops.
Lunetts are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are those you are the only to see) and at the same time their weaknesses: the reality increased from Lunetts will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents point to this idea: there is no tactile sense!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perceived in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be a very good addition of tactical feelings.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to use image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air" : for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the shower is located and gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the teeth.
There are also the booklets on the pognets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, which are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Do you think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is another job down there that will still have to be given away from evil for a long time: the way to believe someone who is physically located in a very small space that he walks into an open space almost infinite - we work on the concepts of race tapes (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, it is only possible to break the brain, it remains for many years of work.
That's what makes work on virtual reality if it's interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fecundation.
The kingdom of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeoise Front" dedicated to the citizens who are in progress, to the cultural and art front.
This ultra-selective list has already been hosted by prominent actors from the art scene of Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe after being known throughout Russia.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the painter extracting Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known as Kirill Miller, this man instead of barbu, all red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the summer Garden or still in the white festivals and vernishes.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, whatever their place of exposure.
He is one of the most socially and philosophical petersburg authors, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent member of the Petersburg front guard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants laugh and make them smell good.
He recently took into his hands a mountain of Barbara and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had enough courage for this difficult role by its existence, philosophy and image of bohemia.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I've chosen the red as specialist in the aspect and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image creator and society.
Even in society, all that is not grey is the result of aggression and a negative attitude.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Cultural Palace where my work was done.
I realized it was my way.
Thus, the wave of old unofficial painters was past and the new, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more vacuum.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces were to meet.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which opened before the work of a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgeoise boheme.
Many are born there: Les NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The Orile of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy back songs in moulting e-mails, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the group began to grow alive, it became "Lenningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not encourage bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his basic education and training were from us.
Galerie "D137, Club "Griboïedov": these are the effects of the Art Clinic.
Our employees are part of it as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organised in the press: it was the price "The characteristics of our city".
I was named "The Year's Stone," and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not easy to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizeable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong current and aqueduct.
I'll have a programd exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clouds".
The clowns belong to a temporary category.
Before I was a social person, today it's bad and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, it's all gone, the tragedy's gone.
I like vodka, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory decomposition.
Today, it's the habit that matters, we're interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but he needs to get him to the trunk instead.
And the lie will be deleted by the curse.
- We've seen you in the role of Barbara's pride player.
Who else can play it?
- But maybe the commercial art can be pretty too?
- Today's commercial art must be cared for, delicately, liqueurly.
A deintegration of culture is under way.
In the past, people were divided into groups, the foresters loved one thing, they loved another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-Communitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each saw 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see St. Mikhailov!
- These are people who have come to see it, that's the sexual and social side that goes.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will win, 10 miles won't win, and at the end of the account it's less management, money, everything.
I've been thinking, the main thing is not to fool them, not to waste their lives.
When I was young, I painted the tables that a collector grew up beside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, we're often confused with ideas.
It has been said: there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumerism has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who just refused money for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the rule of good practice, it was not like that, the classes did not understand culture well, but they realized that good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are separated, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and provide them with a path.
Currently, it's the "king of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are paintings that need to be found in other museums.
- For you, what is Saint-Peter'sburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for it.
And on our stones, art has the evil to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
This layer is very fine for us.
We have to turn art into fashion as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with support from the St. Petersburg Tour
Hibernate in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with on-board land go looking for a relief planet.
In order to save mankind, a big question arises: how to continue living our species on a pessimist or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are two real planets that can be won, it would be just hypotheses.
"It's about Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Institute of Astronomy P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flower.
There was another half century of experience on plants.
Four generations of smallpox grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land variety.
Then we put on the orbit of insects, small dosophile dorsophiles reproducible.
In 1979 wet eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed into an embryo.
There's a regular push on the outside.
It's time for problems to begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the pushin has to find support, he has to put himself on his feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
In the absence of any support, the pussies were disorganized.
And at about 10 o'clock, the new babies saw their instincts completely absorbed.
The pulses didn't react either to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die within four days.
"We wiped their eyes twice, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the lack of experience with the pussies in space.
The last "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their feet in space.
In principle, we found nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience. This kind of research has to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform directly in space reproductions.
It's not a fake thing.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
The wise Homo has the abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional fund.
This type of experience is not realized for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The highest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the women's organism is what humanity is worth more.
Our moustache got busy and no one on Earth could say if he had a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered that question," explained Vakhtang Vachtnadze, retired from the fuse sector and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first Cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second Cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and even worked in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk is lost.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet Union heroes and Russian hero Valery Poliakov.
However, mankind must look for new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonauts Training Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in no fleet, cosmonauts are trained to extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the rapist.
If water is comfortable for adults, however, a foreign environment, for their nutrition, is their real element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of his mother’s belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
It is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very small to forget," explains the nutrition instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who is born the rapist is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
However, the muscles of the belly, the bassin, are rapidly attenuated, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting us on listening simulators.
We can certainly prepare a reception in a special room, the woman will be able to make it out.
"And then?" asked Valery Poliakov to consider this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't wear a food as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we will consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with disabilities, " provides for the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still part of the theory.
However, with time it will become a reality when the Terrens return to their ships to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (the Institute for Public Finance Control) stated that "the control of independent pseudo labour (the " Švarc system " check) has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is training for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Institute for the Control of Public Finance in an interview for Aktualná.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is wrong with us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "System Švarc " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently stated that ODS should not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the House of Deputies, you have referred to a Czech-German project in which the laws on public markets in these two countries have been compared.
What was he really asking about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the management of public markets and specific national legislation as well as its own practice.
We have gathered all of this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more serious and better" yet, according to some parameters, practice such as this is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to develop more and more detailed rules on a continuous basis but that it is necessary to devote itself to the application of even the law.
What can this project really help you, and what is the result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to our efforts to clarify the laws, lower and improve the sails, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any wealth and any criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is at such a point as undercover by the papercase, that those looking for the gaps will find much more opportunities than if the soil remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with regard to the implementation of public markets legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechungshof, which is similarly organised, also has a somewhat different board, but these two institutions are basically acting in a similar way.
The competences are also somewhat similar, however, to a degree similar to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has accounts of this type at the level of different Countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the State.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Lander accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model but we cannot say that it is doing better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider to be a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Or they wouldn't have the advantage of cooperating with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, which has meant for you as an institution the amendment of the Public Market Act has already been felt?
This amendment has recently entered into force and has not yet affected our control operations.
As we're doing post-retire checks, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our comments concern only the preparation process for future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of bad management" with which we have gone through the crackdown of almost 14,000 public markets - where these changes will be made clear, as the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Will you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an increase in the burden of administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more serious and cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the lender (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was obliged to accept that any violation of the market law means a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without resulting from the decision-making process.
Such a system would give rise to pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS should not import entrepreneurs with self-government controls in the Čvarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority responsible for investigating and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on formalities to comply with and that is just to protect the call for tenders.
However, it is also tragic that a submiter is eliminated only because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, what is wrong with us.
The roads are in cold places, but most remain practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also frozen.
However, the network remains mostly practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were practical in the morning, but in cold and snowy areas.
The temperatures dropped and fluctuated between -5 °C and -10 °C, but they should be slightly increased during the day.
Snow falls have ceased in the region, and it remains in the mountains only a thin layer of snow.
However, the crystals of the Metalifer Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service that is due to the broilard, visibility was reduced.
The rapid R6 road and the national roads of the region are now in practice without difficulties.
However, vigilance remains to be established, for example on certain points where the coating can be cool and smooth.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
There are still some of their frozen snow pellets and areas covered by traffic.
In particular in high-level areas, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové regions
The Roads and Roads Directorate reports on its website that some of the East Bohem roads are threatened by the training of wetlands and that snow beds charged by traffic can be found on the roads in mountain areas and situated high.
Road maintenance services alert drivers against the risk of training of beginners in the areas of the region of Pardubice.
There may be some confusion in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavi or Vysoké Mýto, which is mainly on the departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavi were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Mountains des Géantes (Krkonoše) and the Mountains de l'Aigel (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knážnou and Trutnov, a snow layer charged by traffic is present on the roads in the high altituded areas.
In Boheme of the East, the time will be cold today, most often dehydrated, with possible cloudy passages.
It will breathe a low wind and temperatures will generally be between -3° and + 1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are practical today, although in places it is necessary to demonstrate increased vigilance and adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are between -3 °C and -9 °C.
After the last snow falling and the freezing followed, some communication routes may be in cold places.
Drivers can expect to cross broilard areas, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is what comes from information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 road is practically feasible, however, road maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the national roads are dry and frozen.
Some trions can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
Departmental roads and third-class roads are wet and in this case the storage of frozen trions is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the most frequent roads in the Shumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers in the Olomouc region, located in the altitude area, must now count with a layer of thick and soft snow on the roads.
This layer remains on the hill called "Červenohorské sedilo" and on the road leading to Videlský Krijž after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced the road maintenance staff on the ground this night; according to the noise services, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are practical without difficulties.
"On the heights of the Şumperk district are snowy remains.
Drivers traveling in the direction of Jeseník should be expected to meet the Col said "Červenohorské sedlo" with a thick and soft snow layer," said today to the ČTK chief of maintenance services in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also became on site during the night; according to these latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now detached and exhausted, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district roads are easy to use, however, drivers in the Šternberk district should pay attention to the timbers in forest areas to the wet remains.
Ústí regions nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the North Boheme road maintenance services have reported several difficult hits.
There are police data that, in addition to some snow or snow-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Kníce in Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so snow and snow should remain on the roads. In the mountains, particularly in the south of the Central Plateau de Boheme, there is no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No movement difficulty has been reported for the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of verglas, including those around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow during the day, cloudy sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that are corroded under the weight of the snow until they reach the ground.
Shimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these new alarms, the kind of pieces we love falling in.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are on a regular basis and we are said to be the only group capable of collecting a positive energy remnant to resist or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a truly unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It's a charity action that we've been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing at the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 1110 hours in the morning.
On December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, will be completed by 12 hours in advance.
Who have I got this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, and then we were all designed with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state of the world we leave with our children.
At the end of Maya's calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymme against the end of the world, which is called " End of the world Canceled " (in Czech " Konec svec sveta zrushheno ").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will she be heard at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, at the end, if we succeed and that the end of the world is not going...
It will be sung at the same time by all the players in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also join at a given time as part of a direct broadcast, in fact unique, of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl Xy also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to make them actively involved in these projects.
It has been observed that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it makes them fun.
What will benefit from these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Study Training Centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association for six years.
Teachers regularly meet with students from the Jedličkóv Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertainment them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we are trying to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
A number of music groups and actors will show on stage at each of these concerts?
Which criteria do you have to choose?
We have tried to develop a programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will mount on a Chinese scene, Support Lesbians, Illustratrapere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jirí Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other "bad events" of this kind in the future?
In May we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play next year at the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tournaments?
It's not so terrible that it's air first.
We have five members in electrical failure whose equipment must travel slowly, of course we also trim a lot of baggage and tool boxes....
Until now it has been more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything happened without problems.
With your travel abroad, you can compare how different these countries are for access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have your experiences been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we just witnessed in Moscow that in the east it is only in an initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very low access to persons with disabilities; there it is still running only in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it an evidence of giving priority to a person in error in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association working to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What else do we need to catch up with the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite clear that people with a heavy disability move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very common there that a large number of persons with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposed to progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities is a thing, but the situation will really change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, back in a few years, what has prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, in time, as our moderator Ládía Angelovic said, we lost some control of the situation (Laughter).
The success has only happened in recent years, if I don't lie?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it's like there wasn't in the bottom.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have the goal of reaching such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of tricks that copy each other.
In some way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally sorry, it's natural ...
But mercy is absolutely useless because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must be sorry.
These are people who can live a whole life and expand, provided they have the means they need well.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it's not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's all actually normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
A soul, Ládía Angelovic.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to meet us.
This will be the event of the day scheduled for the end of the world, Thursday, 20 December 2012, from 2 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of The Tap Tap group " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Multifunctional Training Centre Studio in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, in which it is the second member of the former East block (the Czech Republic became a member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years following it had participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's route to space began much earlier.
Before the second world war, passioned Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which it presents ideas derived from its pre-guarded work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (1905) left the cold auditors and later  Šternfeld remember that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld was awarded in France the award of Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work "Astronautic Introduction " .
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of the world-renamed astronautics, and its contribution has been rewarded, inter alia, by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
From 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a welded engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is no longer clear whether the fuss should be used to propel or freeze the drain.
The only information known on this draft is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the fuses.
The research was conducted by Komörka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
There are preserved documents that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of German armed forces, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electric casing pool, designed by engineer Rohozinński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work "Rakieta - torpeda powitrzna i rakietbombamba lotnicza" by a author named Llywy-Krzywoblockki.
The two projects aimed at military use of fire engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of the technology of the fuses were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowi Doradczo-Naukwy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war ended in its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to aviation were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, which contains four more detailed articles on aviation.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy.
By this time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) worked to enter the International Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and since the autumn, PTA has become a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological Fusée (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which becomes the first Polish Fuse to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1,800-metre-wide hole had a length of 80 cm and weighed less than 5 kg.
Then an improved version was built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959 flight tests on two RM-2 floors were carried out in the desert of Bledov.
It had a length of 1.4 metres and probably weighed 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific work - RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to monitor the wind at altitude.
But in 1963 all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 merger was established during the period 1962 - 1965, successful in the first RM-type mergers.
This hole, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A Fusée had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum volume of all these types of engine was 37 km.
In the 1965–68 period, the Meteor-2 mergers were established in the Aeronautics Institute, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 vessel had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later is still to be mentioned.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second non-Soviet cosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court passed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to consider this problem from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in particular that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital linked to a frozen financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (sales) result in price tension.
The following meaning should be laid down in this context: a producer seeks to import low-sale goods in order to resist economic competition in " making the price more expensive " of the competitor, with a view to removing a larger part of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
To a large extent, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad or purchase at low prices or disappear. The result is an important unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and hence the same responsibility for unemployment as it does, the social burden of the State is necessarily increasing.
All of this strengthens the perfect willingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damages caused by society as a whole during this course of profit.
This situation is so public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital in different economies create a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to launch themselves into mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are placing their own people at the expense of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the existing laws.
The objective is to make it economically difficult for its own people to accept the right of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is partly due to a system of economic constraints in the long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, a restriction on the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the gap between rich and poor.
In RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who have been unable to meet their needs with their own work for years.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes increasingly evident that employees receive salaries such as the State is obliged to pay for a supplement in order to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as a helper to the Federal Parliament.
The economic measures to be taken by all Member States of the south of the EU are undoubtedly a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poor wages, outside society, in hopes that private capital will one day be invested in their countries.
The question must be raised here: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may no longer come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This is also true of all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, but that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory intervention.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by itself, the whole state.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, in legislation where everything is condemned but not punished.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial means, national departments are tasked with the development of legislation projects to law firms closely related to industry.
These draft laws are then adopted in Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions declare it, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies aimed at liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The State has been in full deliberation for a long time and the functions have been attributed to violence.
The pieces of wine, the benefits obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these items.
The down-tables and corruption would spread without borders and the people would make choices with already sold voices" ... ... "The honest people did not seek any functions, it turns out once the state remained 8 months without consuls."... 'It really started to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was self-occuracy and that it was necessary to choose an energy man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompée spirit, but it is Caesar that has transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, regardless of the interests of the society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and value the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as at other times, there is an unprecedented decline in elites, without any effort to undertake profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and Communist regimes in the liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be considered a sort of break before a new step.
The fact that current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human lives lost, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnessing and crimes against humanity as we know from the past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and improve the position of private capital monopolies in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Rein will never come out of violence and will never be able to" say Sting in the song titled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "in no way do we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any," said Gutel Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have increased.
Some take the part of Israel, arguing about its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians as terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling upon the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in its current wave of killings; however, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those in the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived up to the start of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view that is "under the wheel", on the one that is mainly benefiting from tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (in keeping with the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the individual group, which is the main inspiration of modern history events.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
At any given time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they were due to their acts in the throne to someone who was leading their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration will generate some powers that have not been achieved in one generation.
The Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the poor (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I am not excluded).
Can be written on their subject.
That's right.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts that they have been linked to and which have always meant to them to strengthen their power, increase their fortune or both.
They have large participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or carrying out wars against countries where they have no such participation yet (before Afghanistan invasion the number of these countries was 7 after Iraq invasion of 5 after the conversion of Kathafi only 4 while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to go against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew his central bank status to the Bank of America of Rothschild and attempted to issue his own money (governmental, I understand well) during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to disband the FED, he was killed in 1963, and Mr Louis McFadden was persecuted in 1936 while he was trying to try a trial against the FED in order to trigger the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their ambition for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a franc-mason initiated at the 33rd grade, which was the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eradicating Europe's major state monarchies, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including British, and the third was to reduce the world population from 1 to 0.5 billion (a large amount of slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create one universal religion (eccenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution), and finally to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the wealthiest family clan with their heads is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to worsening the situation (see the creation of the EFD to avoid any crises such as they caused in 1907).
After they succeeded in triggering the first world war by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungary throne, they destroyed Xharist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitalization without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the kharist Russia) and followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to make the second world war easier, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a climate of conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany the conditions of radicalization of the aparable masses (they are then sufficient to place a sufficiently energy-powered leader, representing the rain of couples, offering simple solutions), and, on the other hand, they have created a Czech Republic composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (that it actually has) of the fifth column to set fire on power and launch a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, including one of the branches devoted to the creation of a Jewish State, of preference in the region of historical Judah with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations of a massive Jewish migration to Palestine and the first outbreaks with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The Second World War eclata; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chain in which international banks initially held it; or if everything he had planned, the fact is that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war repairs imposed on Germany at the beginning of the second world war, the establishment of the State of Israel has opened a fireplace that could lead to a third world war.
If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be like it was during the second world war, the first victim of wars, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of dispute and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level (it's enough to see how people are actively divided between parties and Israel's defenders).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a torturer inflicts another torture according to an endless cycle of violence and where, at the root of all, is the ability of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international banks offer people only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascinating, loyal policy for international bankers, who is doing everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the destruction of Ormuz by which 20% of all the world's oil (this shipping corridor has no longer than 2 billion) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appears the issues that David Rockefeller had in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of teachers and slaves.
A world in which a bunch of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new birth can be implemented at birth by making it totally controlled.
"To force all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to bear on their hands or face a red iron mark, so that they can neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood: that the one who has good sense is counting the figures of this beast.
This number is the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The Argo film: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of protestors composed of Islamic students took over the U.S. Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had been in the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not give up on the US administration of a positive issue, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would seriously undermine the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had begun on the establishment of a theocracy regime, it was unable to achieve the liberation of hostages.
It was a hard time for the United States loan, but it was even later intensified by the fiasco of the force's attempt to release hostages.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations by the Government of Algeria.
Their success in the United States gave rise to a wave of solidarity and anti-iran feelings.
The Iranian debashion strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's failure to face Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The Argo film, by the actor and stage actor Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she is employed, six employees are evicted from the embassy.
After complicated trials, they were found in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA is able to get them out of Iran through a rock cover: they leave the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team who came to make repairs to turn a large science-fiction film.
Combination of species
The expert's exfiltration plan Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores were represented by this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company owned by real offices.
The details of the operation remain secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an insulating combination of several species.
This is part of a political trigger designed in a realistic way but also a "caper motion", the story of a successful strike, of a stroke - such as in the trilogy of the Ocean's tall, twelve and tritren.
The environments are successful: the sequences of Teheran documentary style (in the sub-titled sequences are presented with iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which the same situations have been reviewed in the film, there is no great difference),
the lightest passes of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exegetation,
and then scenes from the CIA district district and other institutions with men who are accustomed to discussing the situation around conference tables, in the colors and on the telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to re-start his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected actor and his actor's game stopped raising ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-term after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the trigger "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his city of origin, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the characteristics of its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also testifies to this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is taken" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are on the streets when real facts are being rebuilt; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and unpredictableness that occur when Sudan, in a given place, writes a history page.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the false tour team in Tehran's market).
Too many actions in too many locations
The stager had to be satisfied with a subject offering only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He was very successful, he sometimes raised some elements to reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is separated by a telephone cut in America and the follow-up on the landing track is quite cut off by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its different nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are all charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their personalities would have deserved a bigger place and that is not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is shown with a moderate interest, appreciation of the achievement and style of the 70s.
It leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another story, in some way, not today, and as an illustration of the extreme nature of the representation of secret services as powerful and all-knowing.
Rules for swallowing balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey on the most absurd banking costs each year, has decided to launch the competition from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a 40 per cent share of women for the management of large European enterprises has been the source of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, director of this survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can signal by the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU's workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, Nacher reported.
The EU's conflicting regulations include, for example, the obligation to add biocomponents to fuels, which have harmful effects on the environment, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken bags, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of using the term "carriage" or withdrawal from the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 inches.
European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (and the Czech Republic currently imposes on its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interest of pressure groups is also due, for example, to the fact that bananas in the Union must not be of a size less than 14 cm or to present an abnormal curve.
The European Commission argued that it would only harmonise national non-homogeneous standards that complicated trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been adopted despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food spills.
The first price may be indicated in this survey in the EU Regulation of the last year, which should include a warning that children under 8 years of age should not go to bed without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey where balloons are the first cause of death for children by force.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for breathing in spring storms.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue to Greece, anyone with an official role within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" comprising liberal economists, the bankovnípoplatky.com server has appointed in this investigation, in addition to the abovementioned absurdities, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then goes beyond, for example, the volumes fixed for preserved champions and is therefore a serious threat to them.
The organizers of this survey considered the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to request subsidies.
However, these ideas are not original from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have sea-offs.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the autumn of 2004, the Minister for Agriculture of the Age Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, as a result of our production of wheat, and then the so-called "interventionists" purchases, the State had found itself with stocks full of which it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responds positively to the Czech request and organises an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grant were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Paul Némec (US-DEU), which had to be used in drafting applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "The strange regulations are rare".
If the rules often lead to criticism in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as its general development are worth noting.
For example, experts say that the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (but it does not always win) creates strong emotions in the Czechs.
If, at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoukké váróžky" for what the name "Tuzemský rum" goes back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzemak".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol and not on beet sugar may bear the name of rhum.
In the official list of EU-registered products, there are today a company of world-known pheromes such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's massepan or Parme's biscoits by Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohorêlice et de Třebönn ("Pohorélicý a Trébońský kappar") and the Houblon by Žatec ("Zátecký chmel").
Pardubice's spicy bread ("Pardubický pernik") and the goats called "Cornets de Horíce" ("horícké turbičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how is it supposed to be presented to the presidential elections?
It's not to be a senator or president who cares about me.
If everything worked out without problems in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been pillaged since the last twenty years, that thieves are not under the poisons and taxes and age of retirement.
I didn't intend to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't ask for, I try to bring up a solution to change it.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am an independent member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly been on the road for the Château (N.D.T.: seat of the presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those you've chosen?
I've always said that I'm going to launch myself in the battle for the Château according to the results of the senatorial elections
I then made it clear that if I were a senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it's just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the largest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also for all those who are trying to change.
This adds to the pressure that breaks the reputation of people and undermines freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
For example, I was told that I was suing journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's adviser.
Let's go to your visions.
You started the fight for the Château as a war horse with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements over twenty million [of the CZK].
At this point you must change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I had to force the tourist guide activities to be a free profession, and I gained a cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or right with a good project, it is clearly rejected and it is too late for citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more chance of receiving support from all parliamentarians.
I have the privilege of being able, without classifying and teaching, to take on every side what is best for our country and to apply it.
Do you rather think of yourself as a man of the right or the left?
From a point of view, I have the impression that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but that they gather people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I do everything in part against bad ideas.
Do you get tired when someone tells you you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain objective and a vision.
You're trying to get close.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without Parliament's support, you only have slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with it.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and try to get them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, this would not be a problem of direct television transmission to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties asking them to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to pressure the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, which was obtained through pressure from the public opinion.
I have, without any desire, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find alliances for my opinions and my visions.
I just started to get involved in politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm just trying to make progress, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves to the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jançura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the frauds in the mazout.
I've been introduced because people are really unhappy, but now I'm tired.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that will make it difficult to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, such as the choice of direct suffering from the mayors and princes of the regions.
Do you think you're setting up your own part?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is unstoppable and then I don't have any financial means.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal assets.
In Prague I have an area of 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of some ten million art, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
In the past, I had an Aston Martin, because it was a big dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was flirting with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You run in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I end up?
I've already invested 2 million and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors clearly shows that my programme is not of great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are overall covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live in it, for example, to pay my son's English school that costs 30 miles a month.
If my only goal was to win money, I wouldn't have made any choice.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in order?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the lead in the travel agency early.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I need to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To convince you, it's enough to record Spijkenisse and the newly raised book mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building boring, it's very futuristic, so something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passing passer on the street's bottom.
Stefan Spermon, an informant in a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, he's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone on the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes from his full grace to one of these kungar libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a city door that has nothing to do with attracting Rotterdam's gates, has a very special record.
The community of 80,000 lives shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to round up some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that are on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small concrete painted concrete.
The success of cultural offensive remains limited.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to recover their hand on statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam MVRDV architects' office, master of academia and creator of buildings full of minds and often cynics, accepts the project with its usual flag and presents it in 2003 with five books under arm and a face-to-face reclamation.
And while the jury members were still looking at themselves, confused and raised their shoulders, Maas, the face-to-face, fills his choice books by order of size to make them a pyramid, and ends his speech as an active argument by: "common love!"
Here, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, or, as it has been said, Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountains of 30 million euros were frozen.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and some mytho buildings and houses for a total of 50 rooms.
In early November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is also the case with this small black castle, which has so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pieton area and a fairy of a symphony, whose white faces invite them to think that they are opening a theater, they are rich in modern architecture.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in her history.
The long path to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under foot.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the Massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made of glass is bright and clear, the land in Dutch brigades and elegant reverberators speak the language of municipal public places without any mistake.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls playing the ball.
And all over books, books and more books.
"Of course, library radios are along the façade and in the middle there is a large and shaded room, which is often uncomfortable and personal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely confused the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces of the interior to the outside.
The interior of the bookstore was properly furnished: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black areas of the library, which are both lamps, both ballasts and scaffolds.
A new experience for the sight, touch and taste.
Even the architects and engineers of the built-in building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explained Job Troubost, head of the project at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard.
That's how one day we found ourselves in a farm freezing an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it has been used for years from the synthetic membrane of a millimetre of thickness as a substrate in holes and fields.
It's a good market and we get time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it out.
For the library, the membrane was compressed for the first time in such quantities, instead of a thickness of four centimetres.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the " Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a shade, homogenous and resistant material, with both a new car and sports shoes.
The top of the 105 steps is located on the top of the mountain.
Nearly 500 metres away, the literature coffee offers us an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquets and canals.
These latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute in particular to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literal mountain.
Gifts for the New Spirit
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model environmental project," Troubost writes.
The building temperature is adjusted by geothermal.
Whatever the mountain of books is located below a glass watch, the sun shines only a little while inside, even in the days of good times.
The wood-mounted wooden spaces are mounted across the glass frame serving as a pair of sunglasses, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are expensive from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic informant mentioned above, is already at risk of entering the new library.
The Verhaig list was already there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, also described Boekenberg as "the final soul found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the opening, each citizen was invited to give a book out of his personal library.
This measure has enabled the lives of the library that has not yet been fully handed down (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The radios are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe our invitation has created a relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision put Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of observer State to the United Nations.
But then she chose the suspension.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Berlin must, however, be cautious because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think it no longer supports the American position.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, but it was too critical for Israel.
In the event of the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its foreign policy, seeking to avoid a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union is a complex situation.
The Germans are therefore facing several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they're not used to.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans in particular?
It expresses its willingness to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national affairs.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and its support in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important developments in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, since it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But there is, in any case, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany at night in its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has thus demonstrated that it should be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the contrary, the United States announced their vote in a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the U.S. internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is in secret proof of a great understanding of the European position.
However, given the country's political configuration, the Government cannot understand its position in public.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem to it.
If you observe the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far from being excited about Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany trying to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners, on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, this would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be included within a wider political line and must claim their unique position.
This is what they are doing right now on the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will play a role in the future and will move Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been delicate.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that makes them more independent.
Is Germany able to play a weight actor on the international scene, Germany only wants to play a key role?
Or are there always difficulties in taking first-time roles?
Germany is not always used to it, which is always unpleasant to him, and for some obvious reasons, the country is always trying to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are understood.
It's not easy for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must consist of very different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but at present the EU does not achieve this empty, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if it doesn't please them, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of the Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese Sudanese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is he really about?
Behind this name is a brand officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoyed a protection such as the company which bears the name cannot complain.
And even if she could, she wouldn't be sure she'd get cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of property law in the Middle East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my office.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also able to copy in all legality, such as Puma, the sports producer.
Pattloch opens a classroom where records are made at the Pekin brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company deposited the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by fitting part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres at several stages that sell practically nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its mandate is to attack money because the Chinese trade mark office officially confers upon Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", of parental mark.
The term comes from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to complain about.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The mark is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damages to reputation are enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, in particular with respect to cost-effective products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, China represents the third world market for luxury products with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion.
However, it is not easy to erase the suspicious records of the trade mark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch states the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the critical name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be obliged to pay money to the plaintiff because he would have landed on his mark in China.
In this area, it's sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Popular cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of Sany cantier machine, the same company that was about to buy the Putzmeister concrete pump producer.
That's why Chinese people can use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquirer of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo that reminded BMW of it. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The house of fashion Lacoste had lost against the pilgrims of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the view of the famous Crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not capable of anything.
The Pékin CTMO brand office, however, admits to having some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed the last year of "an emergency situation in working out a found normal".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have dropped by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the office.
Cost of action
As in China, numbers are often impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million mark deposit applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be appropriate for the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A more expensive legal battle, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plaintiff.
Of course, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the issuer has been able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"This is our fault because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichois.
Freudenberg has obtained some of the following two cases, but the opposite party continues to fight until today.
Watch is on.
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and gains the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trying and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed to the party against a "great amount in euro to six figures" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what this represents for us," trusts Wentzler.
The dangers of the Middle East even threaten to debate up to Europe.
This would be the case if the use of unprotected trademarks would be ensured by the perpetrators of the region.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a hair and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could even prevent deposition.
Wentzler adds: "The guard is to set."
Pattloch and he is advised by German companies to show great caution in their commercial relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to be proud of international law of the brands, that foreigners should rather "record as well as in China everything that is possible to be protected", as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, costs may be much more important than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposite party for the use of its own name, such as Wentzler.
Or we would lose our position on the market segment in question.
World Day to Fight AIDS: kicking the leg, singing, helping
The Imbunbui choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS Orphelins rejoice at their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that spreads much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball boots, shoes for ladies and mocassins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, low, tenor and soprano -, they carry, push and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra head almost loses his toilet shoes when he runs the orchestra with his hands of a wild sleigh.
We're on Monday night, the Imbupi choir repeats a new song in the music room of Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come from genetics in human medicine at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy joke, each choirist has different words, everything in a very exotic language: the zoo, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Helped to Help
UNUSIDA, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found Paris in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them frequent secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, we can become pairs.
This amount is guaranteed to the child for school money, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbui literally means "historic account" or "loans song".
No one can speak fluently the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has moved to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres by flight from Heidelberg, in the North-West Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of persons affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of wood or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, the smallest extent of the disease that affects Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population has never, however, accepted male circumcision, a measure that ensures a proven reduction in the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the 30th century.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Immunians had seen many children in the street where they lacked not only parental care but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no perspective.
At first, it was only a few people who made a personal commitment to pay a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal every day.
However, one year later, the choir was founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been in charge since almost professionally of Esitjeni AIDS orphans.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydiades and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhoea).
Current STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubs and galleys belong to parasitic ST.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragia appear often in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contact between men is the source of at least four cases of syphilis on five reported in Germany.
In adults heterosexually, chlamydiatic infections, trichomonosis, candidosis (fungic), blennorragia and human papilloma virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher incidence of chlamydiatic infections than in other population groups.
According to European findings, three quarters of all infections are related to young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the virus of the human papillome is present in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has doubled in 10 years: the figure has gone from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a reduction of a tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause access to the genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, low blood pressure, and the appearance of buttons and veins.
However, they do not regularly treat any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Conservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or by close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who changes from sexual partners to conduct regular exams.
Most fast-tested ISs can be cured and late seasons can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially the funds that the Koreans collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means are increasing.
"In any case, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-equipped, for example, in one of their grandparents.
The gogos, which is called the old women in zoos, are the villagers in the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphanages, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The homeless Orphelin is in a safe place, in Khanisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals each day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a boarding school and has allowed the construction of two dolls. With the US Health Organisation competition, the association has organized a HIV testing test for many residents.
This is not about itself, because even though the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explained Annette Lennartz, "because it's a matter of sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These crimes imposed by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also identified the virus across the country.
However, there are conservatives on each street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, meat against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbui choirists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs instead of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the inhabitants of the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African is a sign of recognition such as that it not only generates good humor and joy, but sometimes also stirs a alarm at a few grueling borders.
The bus always brings them to Esitjeni, where the Koreans visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezulo.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find the light," the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres by horse, back to Heidelberg, before these choritics who walk in the repeat room of Bergheimer Straße, the light is also found.
Message: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercure
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters of space.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
Although this planet is the closest of the Sun, it returns from frozen water, as three studies published this day in the special edition "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the region of the planet in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 cm and could go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hurt Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have occurred in other regions of the solar system.
In spite of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interviews through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as Miss Cerès.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered as a "planet", according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomy Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portal" of countless stars: the oldest stars are blue and the most difficult points to identify are the "newborns" in the universe's living room.
The telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars were born, baptized "W5", a very romantic name in the constellation of Cassiopée at 6,500 years-old light.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flammable glow of a dying star.
The circle as beignet is composed of elements that the star designs when it dies.
In the vast Nebulous Trifide, 5,400 light years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic accommodation room.
The Pleiades, also known as "the seven sisters", may be observed at night.
However, the telescope further values the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's Nebulaise, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700-year-old light in the constellation of the Verseau.
His comparisons with a continent of land have been worth the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular touch.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest phenomena of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's annals.
One theory is that the analogs are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the biggest and most net photographs that the Hubble telescope has taken is the one of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tendon, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Australian Observatory shows the nebulousness of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittaire, thousands of years of light.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divisioned, divided into three), because three dust trains divide the heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the premiums of a cosmic carbulation in the constellation of the Sherpentaire: 400 million light years from Earth, the clouds of two fusion galaxies precipitate one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abrasion, you can use its nickname "austral fire tube".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of Iris' nebulousness in the constellation of Cephea.
The Nebulous is 1,400-year-old light and consists of dust grains that are 10 percent smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black triangles that are at 430 million light years on Earth.
The Space Telescope photographed this group of Galaxies baptized Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebule is the most bright group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The celestial sphere always gives birth to new stars.
These stars, which are related by the Nebulaise of Rosette, also continue to create young stars to 5,000 light years of Earth.
In this galaxy of light rays and perceived by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed mostly of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more distant in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hall of the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is located.
It enables us to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror itself reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa was segmented to make savings.
The diameter is still about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity has its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals with the help of the Aricibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owned by a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the ability to calculate its machine.
View of the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a proper installation of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the OSCE site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of about 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
They burned two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes him admire.
However, the most important images of space come from Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabited.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The Space Telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to space as soon as possible in 2018 on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will have a mission to find the light produced by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercure also opens up ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have been showing the presence of ice in Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger poll in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have certainty.
Drink beer daily, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of dignity of the patriarches of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of dignity of the patriarches of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of extreme romanticism.
Along the way, the small bus stops along forested hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we're here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group is living in the name of Talysh, about which we don't know much, if it's not that they speak perfectly Persian and Algeria and that they have a very longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town of Plastrone with its very aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not agree with the landscape of picturesque mountains.
European tourists are rare here, the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too dangerous.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is persuaded that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou became famous in May because of the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It is the direction of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum in the world.
There we can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region, which is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
To have another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslimov, a 168-year-old shepherd.
However, there is no birth act.
And when it is thought that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Muslim age seems more than questionable.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," states Fatulayeva.
He would have been married three times and had 23 children. At 136 years of age, he would still have a daughter.
Would Şirali Muslimov be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at Rostock's Max-Planck Institute, also heard him talk about man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Elderly elderly people also live in some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "In Sardinia there are also people who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the absence of documents, without having a record of civil status.
Every day, a glass of red wine
Nevertheless, people in the Lerik region often reach an age of dignity from the patriarches of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guide azeri, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem likely that the rich foods of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many who drink a deep wine daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Kengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see it throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground next to a bay, where she cuts the content unscathedly.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also building in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests served in typical wines armed in the form of bread.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under its follard are covered with long triads of a thin blonde that his son reveals with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I never used shampooing," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly retirement is enough to live
She always ate what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and small cheese.
For the rest of my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments have been after World War II.
But everything improved when Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of the propaganda stands in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation's father figure, a man who still led his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham succeeded him.
Whatever the case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan are not aware of the stress.
Mirzayeva receives every month 230 manats (about the same amount as euro) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the son who has long been crying from Mirzayeva has been saying, "The elderly enjoy a great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" lost in the Constitution
The revolution took place in Cairo.
Revalalal demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on charia is violently contested.
The President of Egypt is not to have words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was for the whole people, but especially for the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and laymen.
Because all members of the opposition are confused and desperately disappointed.
They were afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Morsi said, almost by excuseing himself, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what it wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, a doctorate of the U.S. University of California.
Will the judicial power be reversed?
The 234 articles prepared at the hot end by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying in some way.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that justice is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This is still an issue of interpretation, and there are good reasons for fear that Islamists are using the vague formulation and the margin of legal work that has emerged in order to apply a more strict interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it would be useful to consider a newly introduced article providing that, in the case of all subjects related to charia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radio spectrum throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would in fact lead to the exercise of judicial authority.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another aspect of the problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to suppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also read in the project "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Of course, it would just be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or disdefating the prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
It is also questionable to hear that it is forbidden "to offend people."
Is it enough to draw a picture of the president or tell a lie about the destruction of a man of law?
Many points are therefore the subject of interpretation in the project which Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "be very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Renewed"
The opposition has been moving for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir's place in Cairo, promising to bury the charia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is over and we're going to win," launched Hamdin Sabbahi, third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the spheres of history".
On Twitter, the instant message service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he announces the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will reverse it," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood is not exhausted yet," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Koran is Our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim confrery called for a protest not on the Tahrir site as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The elderly women and the members of the Salafists, who participated in a large number, complained: "The people claim to apply God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was] their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic place of Thair, where everything began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's parties wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opposition to the draft Constitution, as well as its participants, had been expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time for the people to decide through the Urs of the leadership that must be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have continued until February and covered all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the Moubarak courts.
He did not do so because he shared their concept of the world, but because human rights were inalienable to him.
That's why he's been beaten up, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sontag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three authorities discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are violations of the rule of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President actually denied all his powers," Saeda says.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
Saeda was disappointed, including by the international community, who looked at the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile side with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A demonstration on the Thair place warns: "You will find a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway’s Recycling: Is it the world’s richest fish?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success secret be linked to the appetite of places for extremely hungry fish?
Take advanced famouss.
Place them in the midst of a pile of wet-footed clothes and rooms.
Wait a week.
And you get the deranged smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most caught places.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, everywhere, surprises the air.
The rakfisk consists of dry sand dunes and fermented into the water for a period of time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness rises and it cools, the Norwegians gather to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat cru, then you drink aquavit glass," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time pumper also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people enjoy small fish bags and have a large amount of drinks.
"Some people prefer it to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some shit.
If you can avoid doing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent hours in a bus.
The rakfisk goes back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was caught in shallow water barrels in the air and then landed in a dormitory.
Then, during the winter, once thoroughly fermented, the fish comes out and--there is no doubt with the senses of amorous by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly abroad to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedish, their old rivers whose country was not so rich for so long as Norway, are crossing the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, a vital element, whether it's exciting, from the past of Norway.
This is part of the most popular dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer painting or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international times, which is not to be pursued.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Brevik, the extremist right-wing racist who beat 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they talk about "the July 22nd incident".
The Norwegians have the wrong to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important things in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explained Anna, our servant, to the blue horse and to the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a hand racket.
We're -- as you say -- smart people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to make us notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - however, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were making money through the windows, during the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its cordon of its well-closed bow.
"As long as we can skim in winter and make the rounds in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she added in a ridiculous laugh.
I've got my nose under my nose, and I've got my krafik dose to buy me what to eat.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we use rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the most delicious of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter has a cloud-padillon, surrounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in Eurovision's competition.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our point, Howard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man fell from his chair, maybe because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fishing emancipation.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take his duties in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, he is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
The road movement in Mexico is particularly bad at this time.
In a city where furniture is legion in normal time, a security barrier has been placed since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the streets.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from returning to work but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
The next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential leave to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A complicated job waiting for him.
Mexico's economy is well informed of the results of President Felipe Calderon, but the country is planning on a drug war that has already cost some 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has committed itself to reducing violence against the people of Mexico," said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama of the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before co-chairing the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very popular and tentacular state that enshrines capital. On its pre-election land, opinions on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is included in the memory of everyone.
The premises are dedicated to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of Mr. Pena Nieto's new roads, an important improvement has been made to these roads, sometimes packed and full of cravases.
Treed plates are added to the outside of a new sports complex and an interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the convention and part of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we expect a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was won in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many incidents within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticisms of the opposition who appealed to the new president to lack of charisma.
He is an entire, very committed man, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent man of state and, above all, he can hear.
However, this is not always the image that people of their former governor have.
In Nezahuaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could no longer be flexible.
Hidden under the highway bridges, it is, in all respects, a bathroom in the city of Mexico.
The problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military had been called back to fight drug gangs that flourished in the neighborhood, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a left-wing area, dozens of women were killed during the last two years on the ground.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a very famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's tractors say he failed to address the problem of eternal deaths against women when he was in operation.
At the worst, they accuse its administration of refusing to see the reality in front.
In a concrete house, typical of this abandoned neighborhood, Irinaa Buenodia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version is a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," said Mrs. Buenos Aires.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body rigidity had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has seen refusing.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old roommate, a troublemaker, a puppy.
They want us to accept what they're saying and get caught.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his Saturday scarf, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to give priority to it during his mandate.
"I hope he will be as good as the president as he was when he was a governor," said Olvera, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
The prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during the detention.
The trial relates to Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case because Manning's sequestration has been carried out under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, on Friday, that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the leading source of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- had failed many times to complain about the ills he claimed to have committed during his military detention.
During an interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter- interrogator -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request for Manning to be classified as a reason for the sequestration in very difficult circumstances and for a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having won thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and gave her answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was globally "very professional."
The complainants did not complain of any ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they were dealing with them, but they did not mention the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after dealing with concerns), and therefore this did not mean that I did not raise problems," said Manning.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment at a meeting in January 2011 with the Special Committee that had met to mention the suicideist thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level under close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted it to be removed from my status... to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified yesterday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Corps des Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to kill himself while he was in Kuwait and had been late once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not held responsible for what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very disturbing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in this case," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this case.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a material, a cover, tongs, clothes and his Lunets.
He tried to stay in motion because sleep or stay longer during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also explained that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, also, the judge asked Manning questions about allegedly reported in his Jewish testimony -- that after being forced to sleep all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand before guards and other prisoners one morning while calling.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the court's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had resigned from his guard's order that he should shut down his cover that could hide his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his clothes, his tongs, and his Mondays had been removed from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he should be admitted to a court of marriage, a trial that should take place in the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to be guilty of the most serious crimes and to fight for the removal of other burdens that are too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagone confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The main charges against Manning include the theft of public goods or documents, the collusion with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the prosecution officers are detained, it encourages the criminal detention permanently.
But Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are involved; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarret said that the Mexicans found themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico"), one for "External" ("External").
I've been real estate for several seconds, not knowing which file to direct me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called "Mexico" all my life.
It's a ethnic qualification, as well as my friends in Boston use when they say "irland" or my friends in New York when they say "italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my great-grandfather, there was no need for special qualifications or union training.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage entertainment in one language or another.
But I don't have an autochton vocalist, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "Externals" file.
I was thinking about this time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
In general, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their pre-election themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about growth in the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans remain in Mexico rather than risk to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a Union for trade in the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and full of amortem.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to write down half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not for minutes, the memories are everywhere.
As a result, when a U.S. official makes the least critical criticism about Mexico, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among elites -- complaints about how Americans are affecting the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the bakery.
For Mexico, however, the most difficult relationship is that the country has more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to address the issue of amortem?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its beneficiaries and losses, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given time, in our genetic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person belonged to a type of profile -- a thin, uninstructed skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are now living in the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that American dream we live, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is evident.
We agree with him in the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the leading class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humble defect and they touch us as if we were individuals of lower rank and not quite Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous of failure.
If our families had not gone away when they were living in Mexico, they would never have been part of it.
And we will not find ourselves confused on the good side of the neighborhood, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are divisions between the Mexicans and the Mexicans, as Mexicans are more closely reproving their identity and Mexicans are against it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexicans I know do not have the impression to be part of one country or another.
We worshipped the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein's music.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not united in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I have learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to draw closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American partners that Mexico is a great country that absolutely needs to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much of me.
And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to get out of here alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them in the way their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Loves, New Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is yet another obstacle to peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another flow of blood seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persisted to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their former conflict, around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Prime Minister has done everything in his power, and whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are captured by this regional turmoil.
Perhaps their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there are every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this deadly trap.
A war that makes no one lose or wins
At first glance, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November is still under way, this week's fighting has strengthened the two sides of the force.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement leading Gaza since 2007, will have been reluctant to force the Israelites to give up, even though Gaza has removed a fence.
Having killed some of its leaders and rehabilitated the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas won the territory over the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah Rivers, the other more moderate Palestinian tribe.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas became rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a full-fledged regional power, sometimes the closest Muslim alliance of Israel, has taken place and caused Hamas, like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas jubilant and say that the Islamic grower is wandering around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the army of Hezbollah exercises its dominion through Syria, where the rebels of Islamic tendencies can reverse Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the mountains of the Muslim Brothers under the leadership of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most popular and central Arab countries, have changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who later ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who will no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, the participants in Israel's long line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was returned in box.
The Iron Dome-Baptized Missile Interception System proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missions were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unfavourable support; and many European countries have appealed to Hamas to be the source of the last wave of violence.
Most importantly, Israel has benefited, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets in Gaza since 2004, Israel has been separated by suicide attacks, particularly through the barrier of separation that has spread across the Jordan, the main root of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to extend their illegality in the field of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined with another more bulcist party, the leader of Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has the beautiful party.
Why do you steal these Palestinian files by giving them a state?
If they were to lead the Cis Jordan, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and to hit them after they get out of their head.
Maybe the parties on the line will import it for long; but it may be changed by the Arab press.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and otherwise lack appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The budget for Israel's defence is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local sovereignty will not help the new Arab governments to organize their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a stop to the fire what is good hope -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is intended to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to celebrate Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
Both sides need to be driven by those outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable persons on each side, and of the majority of the outside world and of this journal: two states, with a territorial assignment by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and short-term, is that the cease-fire will give outsiders the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now move towards Gaza, under the same title as Turkey and Qatar, is better able than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 border with trade in land and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposed by a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama was also interested in Israel's willingness to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Back to the White House, it seems very relative to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is done through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarettes packages are in force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick bodies cover the shadow green packages that are all identical, whatever the mark
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible image of sick bodies and children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since this Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government stated that the objective was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people never started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message that tobacco manufacturers are carrying through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated with a logo crown with a princess."
Even if Australia records the lowest smoking rate in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
The tobacco manufacturers stated that this would slow down the trade in the black market, which would make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"The consequences of this legislation will come from bad consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco Australia.
China's and Indonesia's counterfeiters will sell much more face-to-face cigarettes in Australia's streets.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes, including silicone for masking terrible packages, increased strongly two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco questioned the law and lost it before the High Court of Australia.
She said that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock recovery.
For us, business is good.
The only good, say experts, is the popularity of social media and the cut-off of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on TV, sports sponsoring and the obligation for sellers to dispose of cigarettes, tobacco marketing is currently available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you have more than one small wine to promote your products, the Internet is the most inconceivable place in excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens for social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who is punished for making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry is gone until Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic are paid in response to these new judicial decisions - these countries have declared to the WTO that trade is inexhaustible, although none of these countries have had important trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the spring of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had had discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the warnings on packagings mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and run the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a picture of the mouth tumor.
To be frank, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that packaging uniformity made it difficult to arrange packages on the floors.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a chair, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had just forbidden them a good time for all and we would have said OK, well, we'd stop and put the key under the door," he added, lifting his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get up.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thankgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I had enough time to think about the topic of the ennui.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones for fun (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But more than that, some universities and experts specialized in the development of the child make the bride's praise.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to hang out from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to use interesting paths, i.e. to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the nose.
So should we welcome the bride to open arms?
Yes.
And don't.
But I'll be back.
First of all, in the eyes of many people, I thought the wedding was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more time off.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Level History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The nose goes very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffiti that call the nose, they go back to the first century.
Then there's the definition we're giving to the bride.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, John D. Eastwood, an aggregated professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After conducting numerous publications and submitting the idea to a panel of discussion of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined it as an experience consisting of "willing to do something but not being able to launch it in a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the nose from the appetite, he says, is that the person is not in the process of doing a job well that she would like.
With the appetite, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What's in the heart of the nose, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
The nose can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are upset tend to think that the problem is from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem is from them.
At times, we may think that we are suffering from a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Board in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants heard about tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, its very high TV broadcast that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the sound band.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more upset than the other two groups - they had a bad focus, but they didn't know why, and attributed this problem to the nose.
When you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, an interruption of attention can lead to the wedding, Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated neuroscientist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring job, "how to look at objects on a mountain chain, music can help you not to hurt you."
In fact, he said, now we know that when we are hurt or we are hit, these gestures, often considered as signs of jealousy, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are authorized to go to school learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to stay without movement," said Professor Fenske.
Every day or every other day, we are suffering from the delay of my flight, a player with a monocord voice, a particularly nice film.
But some people are more likely to be disappointed than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Grade of Prediction to the Innocent" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to become more prone than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied incentives.
However, in general, adolescents are quick to get bloated.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development teacher at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a baby.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents said they were going to school and during their duties at home, while 23 per cent said they were late when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were upset.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of infants today, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adult is a period when the grandson reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I answer my question, is the bride good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it may lead people to take absurd physical risks, to wear pairs or to abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between innovation and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The ring is the way the brain found out to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the U.S.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are hungry and use this energy to play guitar and cook, this will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets angry and you give him an iPad, he won't get angry anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-restraint, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more master of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the bride.
Anyway, I don't think we should criticize him any more than we should.
It is easy to feel out of the constant noise that generates activities and technology is the goal we should pursue.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to be angry more often, but the nose awakens an acute and queer desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to get rid of and appreciate the time to stop.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to launch into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, there is no directive for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day in September he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the camps, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received an invitation to compare for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of comparison.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place of the law than on the place of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were immediately classified.
Police services have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and more for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the weeks to come.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative circuits called for the acceleration of existing marijuana business and continue to blame those who own it.
At the same time, several towns of the denver baths to the west mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening up of Marjuana's commercials approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"It's going so fast that I don't know what's ahead for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of Aurora's police in eastern Denver.
The Washington State Regulators also do not raise any questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the start date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is intended or not, is in advance of most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all with regard to the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognized by Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There's no real past we could base on," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the permit system will not always exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this period, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that ensures appropriate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a area of 30 km around a school, park, game area or square.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Law Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, sent an e-mail to Aurora to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (public ministry representative) would no longer continue with the people over 21 years of age and over who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people of this kind of crime "with immediate effect."
The Chief Oates stated that the police would apply new justice decisions regulating the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In the World County, north of Colorado, the "District Attorney" (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, has a more narrow vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with Marjuana's possession business, mainly in order to pressure users to become involved in decontamination.
At present, 119 persons are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute those people who committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized crime," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favour of the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compares adults for limited quantities.
The representative of the Department of Public Affairs of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't have the impression of wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambiguity among local officials with regard to the legalization of the Marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the persons charged with marijuana consumption and who acts as the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have had a good part of their lives to continue in justice for those who consumed marijuana, and they have also had the wrong to accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case of legality for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and State representatives are planning a new legalized border of sales, they are concerned about the federal government's guidelines, which always ensures the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of the Marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite some mediated arrests by patients under the therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are not likely to break the doors to take small drug bags, there is strong evidence that they are opposed to the approved marijuana sales for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an old political adviser to Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the vote, some local administrations approved moratoriums on the creation of new Marjuana sales, even though it was only a year's report.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and this ban should be imposed next week.
"We do not want to be found in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we are faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the Community's vote rather than the State's vote.
Many questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
These are not the only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was an outstanding place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study history, I decided to do my homework, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father was exhausted and became very ill.
My friends were confused.
The Standard Evening Journal claimed that I had left this university because I had intended to have students of the first class had sexual relations in my room next to me.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with interest that I was a party after being forced to drink in mixed rates.
The truth was less dramatic.
I did.
Yes, I was, because I was a victim of intimidation and was subjected to constant beatings.
Not because of my name but because I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for one and only reason, and in this self-explaining reading, I have been victims of racist and barbaric behavior: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why call that today, you tell me.
However, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing students are subject to the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Members of the Students' Chamber (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "sometimes isolated, attacked personally and felt inseparable" because of their political opinions.
They wish to have a representative within the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary published on BBC Two "Wenderland: Young, Bright and On the Right" ("The World of Miracles: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the policy of the students, which placed the "Tories" as excentriques and neonates.
It would include student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves into Rolls-Royce, is a fully enriched tree and moves with a chrome head cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as emitting bubbles for setting up higher school fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said to a Sunday newspaper "that there is a lot of left-wing participation growing in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, studying history at the Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "inconsolable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, UCA president, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards those who are right-wing.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about the fate during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986 when I was 18 years old and a paralysing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very violent.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of granting Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first day of the week of the week of the reception, when the new students came in contact with others and teachers, I enjoyed what was going to happen next.
I found out that the professors not only participated in the classes against the Tory students but also enjoyed them.
It was as if the policy on pregnant minors, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was recorded in the classroom tree.
The first sarcasm I was a victim of was a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man in the desert face, was easy to carry.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students are laughing.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he started out of your garage.
I'm back in my room, inconsolable.
When I went to dinner tonight, I sat alone and I heard a slight knock on my shoulder.
He was a second year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm so afraid it's that way.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most of Tory's young people claim to be Labour (worklists).
Later on, in the local pub, I've been trying to hide.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This strategy has failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students returned the refresher.
I was confused, Sal.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of sixty years.
Would I be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after the fall of the night?
Would I have to come back to work and review my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgator of ostracism and isolation.
The only open teacher in Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history teacher who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative but also because he was counseled in Thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-Determinist perspective of history.
In 1997, he was appointed professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making the boat between Oxford and the home of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city to dream clocks.
Even my Communist friends had inseparable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to take you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Stirred by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted next week, when another professor of history suggested that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and "old crap".
The record was short-lived.
He's my father who's got the last clone of my Oxford circle.
At this time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I did my laundry and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with a pleurnichard.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school facility.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 first ministers of Tory, but also benefited from an immeasurable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture " opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Couture.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
At the opening of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", the curator recognized it as a prestigious retrospective that gathered more than 130 high-cost models created for its house of worship over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemy Italian accent.
This exhibition is the point of pride of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani" but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and by the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March next, there is a number of impressive private letters and photographs signed by the aristocratic cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories such as the trophies of his social ascendancy: from the humble poet of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least they don't exaggerate their cigarettes on your magnificent carpets like some pop music stars," says Barona Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular guest with generosity and elegance.
"Our worship is all invited into his chalet of Gstad," explains Heini's ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of the beauty of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian Mangwin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the poet.
Several years ago, after a dispute over the Spanish Place in Rome, we went to dinner at its apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
He was seen and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "model top", which began working with him during the High Court week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go through fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Novelise line challenge
Garavani's life is not an obsessive story but shared love.
He loves the very high people and with the greatest titles and they also love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glass podium of 60 meters wide that proposes to change roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to stand on the podium to admire a "public" of dreaming about Valentino's main creations, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the custom that Monica Vitti wore in "The Night", or a line handle that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybile de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thorn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the poet in 2006
Many of her customers say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "I can't forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pattern, a shirt, a gillet and a dress from the self-heavy collection in 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he's done to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the poet's museums.
"I prefer it to everyone else for his feminity, his great love for women, and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and revealing his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashioner Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can no longer forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a flying jumper, a busted bust and a towel.
"It was a dream that became a reality," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is different to fashion, he is obsessed with the Temporal," explains the Italian aristocracy that shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the night's clothes in the box with "the greatest care, because one night's dress is not just a dress, it is also the whole of the memories she's wearing."
The King of Mode
The main end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress taken at his wedding with Paul de Grece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the cutler thus calls its cutlery) to realize this dress in itself with pearl screws, twelve different types of teeth and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the superintendent of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from high society".
Observanced for years by the "know-how" of Nobel laureate, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavalierre del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts and des Letterres, decorated by the Legion de Honor, Garavani cumulates as much honor as any husband of his clients.
"His calmness, his well-being, his well-being and perfect appearance have always kissed me in my eyes," acknowledged Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The Hardest Mediere in the World: Kawah Ijen's Human Mussels
For four euros, the Indonesian Volcanians risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilograms of suffering through rocky rock trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their lives by suffering from the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas from the entrances of the earth solidifies to air contact.
After collecting large rocks of suffering, which cost almost 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo pans that he carries on his shoulders through the skimmed paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises to 2,386 meters high, but the heavy carriers will be more than 40 minutes to dig this distance, at a distance of torture, by keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not sink and fall into the precipice.
They know that a mistake could not cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who dropped a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen's minors earn 5 cents of euro per kilo of extracted suffering.
Once up, there is a road between tourists who photograph them as if they were animals from around them, and they probably carry heavy panics, walking 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining society has set up a bit in contravention of 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrinbi, a company operating the volcano since 1960 and, to be said, its employees, it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents of euro) per kilo of suffering.
It then sells it to 10,000 rubies (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to produce bogs, artificial leaves, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar.
"As we travel about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 pounds (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who generally spends three trips a day.
Each one takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 euros (EUR 11,50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a poverty for such a surhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid $15,000 a day (1.20 euros) and the average monthly wage is two million euros (167 euros),” says the porter who sometimes worked as a mason on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult as it was, but Anton returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the Volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia, it is as indisputable as the suffering: "I married a young daughter of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to become Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, all constant and its eyes are upset by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three years trying to challenge the danger of the Kawah jen, but the suffering has already begun to make him pay the bill, since he covered his face with a mask and wore special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, all constant and its eyes are upset by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French" he promises it in an English more than acceptable.
Mistreated by life, this young and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, a server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a woman.
It shares an insalubre tree measure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the pain does not stop shining at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the midst of darkness.
Defeating the darkness, Anton descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his pocket, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers throw the suffering panels on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not been able to extract the pain to save costs and does not provide any equipment to those who work on their account and are paid on their own.
In addition, they no longer touch one of the 30,000-roubles (2,50 euros) increased by photo equipment, in addition to the entry of 15,000-roubles (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park invoice to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human wife.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," Madrusin protests, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
He can carry up to 110 pounds, he will not stop working "as soon as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, between 10 and 18 years of age.
I won't take my retirement, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although suffering damages the throat and anger of the eyes when the wind turns and falls children into the lungs of the volcano, they are so forced that no one complains about serious diseases... which are obviously added to their normal respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the panthers.
By measuring the panel on its two, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kilograms.
Each day, his companions and he was taken 15 tons of Volcano suffering, which three trucks carry to the port of Tamanasari, 18 kilometers from there by a path of cattle caught by bad herbs.
"I'm not going to take my retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The grandmother of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sufferer.
Time is running out, but the perpetuating poverty of generation is one of the most difficult metals in the world: the one that makes the human women of the Kawah jen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my husband and a patriot, we will fulfill our civil duty and give life!
These words may appear to come from advertising for pastiles to menthe, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video appeared like a powder training on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychinella in the shot" to meet Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency from the original video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in an interesting way by means of this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill their "national duty".
It is only intended for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the world's worst in the area of birth, so we feel that it was a subject we should address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as launching perfumes to the ferromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn't work too hard.
So we are saying this: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-East Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, head of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it was due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life and priorities beyond marriage and the formation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delays in marriage and birth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the reduction of the population has created a feeling among the local population.
In Singapore, we find websites that are full of pain-deprived xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of taking wages to the bottom and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has been aware of its most electoral results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher rates and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has an impact on the economic growth of a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to touch the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments known as the "catcher box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sales are very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and discourage promoters who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company El Developers, says that its "catches" are sold much faster than larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards provide more clear instructions to promoters, which were previously placed on the streets if they wanted to offer too few housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards raising the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, they would seem to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, that's why people later send it," says a young framework.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another young man of twenty years tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, these are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What's private online is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private area or "the private area of life which we can protect from any intrusion".
What is it about the private sector for at least 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses by posting on the Internet of events that he would certainly not share online?
The newspaper ElPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15 who were frequent users of the toilet.
In four cases, they associated the term "some very personal thing" with the personal level and "the word of the past and the name of the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, 10 years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post sympathies or games.
I also talk to my friends.
"I wouldn't share any of my photos or anyone who would do the stupid thing," he said.
The young man recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenaries, convicted persons, crimes or to write embarrassing or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them belong to the family.
His mother is actually part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will no longer trust anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the last one, he does not admit to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example, music," he said.
According to the young man, no one had made any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just delete them from my account," he confessed.
José joined Ask after reading a suggestion on Twitter.
The experiences we have today under the name of cyberharvesting are not foreign to the young man.
A neighbor of one of my friends was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He's never about who it was," he said.
The victim, says José, didn't close his account.
"He just passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was tired or angry.
"Even if I know it's from cybersex," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Education, believes that in order to focus on children and adolescents, we must understand that the objective of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who owns a university professor at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and digital immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are themselves, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He is pleased that the subject is complex, "because we ask them to have a criteria defined on what they should or should not disclose, publish or tell an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say it doesn't matter," she says.
Then, Porras cites some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
You know what others publish about you?
When you identify photos of the holidays, do you ask other people to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do online.
These are the same rules.
"In the Internet everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Esturado Guardia, professor of universities, primary institution and educator of education, states that it is essential for parents to listen consciously to the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of these terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardiania, it is essential to remind children that they do not have to talk to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it had been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the seven mandate holders.
Effe tried several times to access the document signed at the 7th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated that it would be publicized after the closing of the summit and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government ' s website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in short press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information that circulated among journalists was provided by the press escorts of some of the government of Unasur who attended your meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian password.
The only document published during the day was the list of present presidents, which has caused some disparity among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was hosted by the 3rd South American Summit (ASPA) and, although this was requested by the press, it had not yet published the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published in the last month of March.
At your two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment from the Hague Court that breaks a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at your regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the complainants of the two parties in the process that Lima attempted against Santiago and began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and implement the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are facing today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country in respect of international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Pinéra, handcuffing President Humala on both sides.
The confirmation of the two Presidents to be submitted to the ICJ took place after Colombia declared this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit itself to the decisions of the International Court of Justice, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it would consider gravely wrong.
The summit took place without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011, after his former President Fernando Lugo's death, has not participated in your meeting.
The host president, Olanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandater read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 project action lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of Unasur would put in place "the important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing housing permits agreements".
He reported that actions would be implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to drugs, low-priority Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triophalis matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and make a better future for our populations," the President Humala concluded.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas, by bringing our countries together and by creating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned five of Peru's cross-cutting areas from the coast to Brazil, and that two were looking for a more important connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the South American Union," of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbours is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before starting your regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to discuss quietly the maritime dispute through a trial of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will require discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
The Presidents of Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they intend to assist with the take-up of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, in the context of the summit, the Ministers of Defence will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the United States, although the last country has been suspended.
Peru provides the temporary presidency of the regional block.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example of Europe".
The President of Korea, who participated in the Fifth Summit of the South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State TV, Peru, that Europeans "were interested in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the United States member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, must be achieved, but there are still areas of reaction that we want to make part of the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President demonstrated his interest in the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who fight our ears never commit anything, on the contrary, we, South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Korea ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not acted on his own principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions based on which Assange would be extradite to a third country and that its process would not be respected".
In addition, it criticises the Swedish justice that has required him to submit himself on his territory to a questionnaire on alleged sexual crime while "the Swedish legislation itself allows him to do so by videoconference, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health was deteriorating.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that her physical and mental health is deteriorating by being infected in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"It's about anybody's health," he concluded.
Korea points out that the asylum solution given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the award of a safe way for him to return to Ecuador, is between the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and emphasizes that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the healing of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a series of procedures with different European institutions," he said.
And he thinks that "if Great Britain gave the rescue tomorrow morning, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it does, and as it has done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London, or asked him about Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Korea had taken advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he explained that what he would not tolerate was "mediocrity, evil faith and lies that lead to freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not bad or corrupt political men but bad journalists for the sale of intelligence, singing and exorcism," he said.
Under this angle, he was pleased that this was not such a kind of journalist as "the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and instead of putting forward its recollection, "it would deepen the revolution to continue the way and to follow the right path".
Korea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the context of the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "should show itself firmly and not tolerate opportunism and attempts to break down the rule of State," because, in fact, "it would destroy the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers it "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be resolved together in order to pass them on and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed his confidence in the good resolution of the dispute on the maritime frontiers that opposed Peru and Chile within the same court and stated that it was "for the benefit of Latin America to take international tribunals if both countries agreed to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he saw this opportunity "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Korea has made sure that if he lost the early February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never been of interest to me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who would guarantee this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, this would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we never forgive us, I'll do the same.
"It's my decision," he said.
Korea also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just discussing with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment had already been planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a review of the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State has today participated in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations (UNasur) which has ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results of the test: seropositive.
"It's like the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less penalty" in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it, and his findings were such that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which it was found in 1994 after many wars.
Fabrizio has lived with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatism.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic prevented him from saying "because he was without a voice".
At that time, having the AIDS was a symptom of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still suffer when the virus has already caused damage, "expressed" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is now that the survival of a patient who has begun treatment at an appropriate time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HCG leader, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and pointed out that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has been no longer a mortal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of impact of the immune system that patients present at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a CD4 rate of 5004.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," explained the scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is today at an average of 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that 60 per cent of patients identified from the national database have died since the AIDS presence.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
For at least 12 years we have never had any medications, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine patients in 10 are already present with an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to perform earlier diagnostics and, for this reason, it is necessary to propose mass testing tests for all who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the Jalisco AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have been tested in a private laboratory simply because a friend had done it and that despite his youth, he was already a victim of AIDS and suffered from the cancer of Kaposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and want nothing to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's worth three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
Today, his parents only know he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have lots of activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his witness, those who are afraid today, during the course of World AIDS Day.
If they're doing the test, if they've taken risks, they'll soon know if they're seropositive and better this evening, and if they're already diagnosed, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Conservatives on account
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, supported by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has covered the cause of HIV.
And the biggest resident in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, and now we are given hundreds packages, it's very good, but as a result, that today some have not access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", asked with sarcasm and judgements of value by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution; that conservatives are not only sold to accountants, but that they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places where young people frequent them.
It's not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is no longer about paying the girls and the model, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there was a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not like what sex works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases were reported (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth State of the country in number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13e for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of the contamination occurs by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified by a court of the United States ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all national companies with restrictions in their neighbouring country and has problems with solvency.
It should therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the end of the summer, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup brought to trial by Judge Harlin Halle of the Court of First Instance for the Northern District of Texas on 15 June leaves the Mexican companies without defence facing the possibility of embargoing their property beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main wine manufacturer in Mexico to take over the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the cause indicates that creditors must be registered under the U.S. bankruptcy Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formal commercial failure in Mexico.
The first point would involve disseminating international cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the United Nations Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established to this end by adopting the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-corporate vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial failure, the debts contracted by the offices of Vitro against the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are 12 examples here, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Errors has guaranteed debt.
Furthermore, since there were no votes left for the branches, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, the "vatour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited would not have received the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data ignored by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the moment, the family of the Gonzalez Sada interjectera appealed to the same court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The application for insurance will call for non-profit and require the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curial friend ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Trade Errors Act was detailed, indicating that it would exempt the two countries from the conventions signed to the same level as paragraph 15 of the U.S. Errors Act.
It also points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Caraboration of two parties: they assume Vitro and they take the country.
General
The complaints by the Mexican Aviation Society against the company's ex-pattern, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, which has been accused of mismanagement, and the Aeronautics' Union Association has already faced problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values which are accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically provided information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 from the Bank of IXE 198 million weights on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of services from the Professional Department of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main operator of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're in charge of Dragon Mart.
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a shopping and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with an area of housing for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in bringing together South-Easter governments to oppose the monumental project, which is partly located in protected areas and represents the greatest threat to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has set out a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Fraud Trade Agreement, known under its century of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already part of the old history.
As everyone knows, this has happened because the Senate itself condemned this possibility because it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting them in the short term, the real estate promoter Homex launched on the market of the Valuers Exchange for 500 million weights.
This securities issue is the first of the four emissions for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival’s Birth
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, IT leaders, a new Consortium for Competival's social reasons has been launched, whose objective will be to market services from Central and South America's hosting software.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The world-leader of the "Hetin" basketball team Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to it, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhagic hemorrhagic hemorrhage was condemned in 2008 in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball Federation.
"I've been wearing several basketball bags all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls when he was visited by Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful husband for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of her house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind her of her way out of standards, bear witness to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who remind him of his past as a player in the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 50s to 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
"That was my best years, which I have benefited most because I have had the chance to participate in eight Vaccero champions since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been done for many years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrew from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a cost-effective player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?"
That's what Mincy started, one of the best players I had in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shots.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since he was already the head of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he would like to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the pre-Olympical tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived at 4th and where we had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge didn't give us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the World Team of 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just as she fought the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympic Games.
But I prefer that of the Cuban Pan American Games in 1991, when we won the gold and we took a stick to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one who won the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Tonito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 because of a gender problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy during the pre-Olympical tournament of Neuquín in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the umbrella of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it's Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't take into account his trajectory in the different links he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In my youth, I love the work of Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
It has been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, BSN counted up to 17 teams in one season.
What are you doing?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and face teams from other corners of the island during national games.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have seen at least the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch my time clips on YouTube, I benefit from my little kids, and from time to time I attend basketball matches.
And of course, I benefit from my husband's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide as John Ross Ewing's main role, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he engaged a man with no scruples, noduable and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet without screw J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the war in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family communication sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., Dallas production house.
"Larry was returning to his beloved Dallas Christmas city, replaying the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this day of Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her husband in the original series and then met Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, declared his press attachment to Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, dramatic, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exception and he lived his life deep," said Gray in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed a liver surgeon at Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had been very good for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had had a seizure.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was introduced to television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" published by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life had been transformed when he discovered a fascinating genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he was bringing it to him.
He also played in two comedies that were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the film are well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his master's interpretation of the delicious hate J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on Ewing clan and their neighbours were broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?" designed to maintain the suspension around an emotional episode where Hagman's personality is almost killed, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in Paris.
As a result, among other things, the series has reached an audience record at this time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most popular entertainment program in the world, after the final "MASH" episode in 1983, which had assembled 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had provoked him and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if he did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied but charismatic man: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to interfere with his alcoholic husband Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it should be like for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here's the honor of the citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is inevitable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is under way, reported the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the TNT channel have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is known for his popularity with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she was given her day in 1931 while she was married to a lawyer named Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where there were many celebrants.
In 2001, he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Suchs about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': The Impossible Memories of J.R.)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he said to the press at the time.
After his liver arrest, he became an active member of the organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the concerned patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he told him in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it'll be fine."
He was also a soldier against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course of "End of the World" has just begun.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This season, when Professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had launched an inconsistencies: the end of Maya's "great record" calendar, on 21 December, which refers to many people as proving the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax haven that some called "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where Christian theologians at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would break down.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we related it, that was a very good period.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to teach on "the end of the world" this season, which will be the last in theory of history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker spends the course "The Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas vary over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and will study how they can be compared to examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art and Anthropology History, made a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to re-enter the course, where the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "an imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and conduct their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final review will take place in the wake of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the seminar, by the people who asked if there was any room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It reminds me of what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort or lack of comfort.
Will Weekesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and nurse student, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students asked, and even less a professor, told us to believe in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was about Maya's prophecy, and in some way we have discounted it," says Julie Zegle, a last year student at Temple, aged 21 and originating in West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is a concern about the apocalypse in Western culture, returning to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a lot of these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
It's most of the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who gave classes to the Philippines this year, quickly replied when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a thanks to the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, there have been numerous dates assumed by the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start immediately to think about the next date" or to reason on the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to the light.
Many told us they were thinking about going to parties "from the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we'll be together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
