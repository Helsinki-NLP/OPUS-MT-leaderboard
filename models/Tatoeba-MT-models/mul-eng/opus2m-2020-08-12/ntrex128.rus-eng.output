Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “go on maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a lack of willingness to adopt a proposal for the appointment of an abbreviation of the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament of Wales).
The problem resolution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible frauds from this bureaucracy.
One of the librarians, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new Abbreviation of Twp and Pwp was “refuse”.
For our readers not from Wales: on the Wally twp means "tupica", and pwp is "cocket".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Walls Party, his organization in general “was not satisfied” and offered other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to writing the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Vulli is about the same as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft amending Act, made the following statement: “The final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is of course to remain behind them”.
The Welsh National Assembly has been empowered by the Act of 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of an examination of the public opinion on the options proposed by Parliament Wells instead of the Assembly, which provided broad support to the local population.
With regard to the designation of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) option, while the MWP option received the highest public support.
In general, the members of the Assembly offer other options, but the President, Elin Jones, will not be able to find all the decisions that are discouraging; it should be recalled that the draft amendment law should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other changes to the work process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the establishment of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their appointment during the debates on the draft law.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in their country ' s name
The people of Macedonia are voting for the name of the country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The international vote was called upon to allow for a multi-year dispute with the neighboring Greece, whose province was Macedonia.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province and has repeatedly been opposed to the entry of its northern neighbours into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on change of name, said that it was not going to be recognized.
However, the rapporteurs, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the name of the country is the most important price for EU and NATO entry.
The crisis in garland income: Always Shut Up St. Martin's Colloquium
“ The older areas I met said that before each corner was on the bar and on the church, ” says Adams.
"And now there's no one else left."
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of the public has changed”.
“At least he stopped being his kind guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
But as for the church, it is concerned that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for them as their leaders would have done it.
At the place of the church, he added, there would be a multi-square home where residents would hardly support the remaining incomes.
“Most of the purchasers of these rooms will be white,” Adams says. “And this is about the day when such churches are finally closed, because new neighbors will never be their property.”
Both churches were built by white congregations prior to the arrival of the black region of Gallem: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the church of St. Martin, 10 years later.
The first arrivals of the Methodist Church left their mark in the last 30th century.
Their building was purchased by black income from neighboring areas.
When St. Martin was transferred to the black community, she was led by a similar John Howard Johnson, who organized a magazine fight on 125th Street, the main arterial arterial of Harlem, where they refused to work or increase in black service.
In 1939 the fire caused significant damage to the building, and during the reconstruction work, Johnson’s father ordered the establishment of a trailer.
Similar to David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin's church, he proudly called the Carolon "Cultures for the Poor".
However, the expert who tried the Carolion in July called it “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was a charylon from St. Martin's church that was the first instrument in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play a greater role in the Riverside Church.
According to Merryunaser, St. Martina's church has not yet been replaced.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s church, the situation has been complex with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Episcopal Church.
The collection of immigrants, the lead organ of the arrival of world leaders in July, expressed concern that the eparchy “was trying to transfer the value of work” to the collection of immigrants, although the latter had no regard for the choice of architects and contractors sent to eparchy.
Some sources have expressed concern about the lack of transparency on the part of the country.
In California, shark wounded a 13-year-old miner who was a winning miner
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, a 13-year-old teenage girl in California was attacked by alcohol and suffered physical injury.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the beach of Bikon Bitch in Encintase.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV (San Diego) station, on Saturday morning he ran with his friends and, about half an hour later, heard the boy's cries for help.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was excited about the lobster's concept, but soon he realized that he cried out, "I liked it!
They have listened to me."
Moved to the nurse, Hammel noted that “he had been completely destroyed by the skin around the key”.
“ I called for everyone to get out of the water and say, ‘Here's the shark!’” Hammel says.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children ' s Hospital of Radi (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The kind of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Hayles, during the press briefing, reported that several weeks ago there was an acute notice, but it did not lead to dangerous types.
Gailz also added that the victim of the attack had received trauma from the top of the tube.
The authorities covered the area from the Ponto beach in Casablade to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours in order to conduct investigations and to ensure the safety of the population.
Gailz noted that there are 135 types of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury is planning to subjugate the United Kingdom Parfumer Cosmetic Market
Seinsbury is planning to set up Space and Parfumer Divisions in Butts, Superdrag and Debenheims stores with space consultants, based on the models of luxury universes.
The U.S. Parfumer and Cosmetic Market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to grow, while the fashions and goods for the house are falling. To capture a significant proportion of this desired market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, space departments of cosmetics and perfumes will be presented, and in case of success next year they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are seeking to fill the fields that were previously driven by television, microwave ovens, domestic goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetic market.
According to the representatives of Seinsberi, it is planned to increase the two ranges of cosmetics to 3,000 denominations; the first will be proposed such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented to a large extent, in special locations, on the type of goods in Buts shops.
In addition, a business line of Butik cosmetic products will be reorganised with a change to vegan products in order to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury stores will present the cheese producers of Fragrance Shop: the first one has already been opened in Crodon, South London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet trade and the tendency to buy small quantities of products per day in small pockets soon from home led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Kup, President Seinsbury, says that the aircraft will gradually turn into the universe and its network of supermarkets will fight for buyers in the competitive fight against cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets are located in Argos and some of them are now able to find Habitats magazines since the network acquired both brands two years ago, leading to increased sales of food goods and supplies through these purchases.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetics and appetites have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, the Seinsbury and Butts joint ventures were organized, but there was a difference between participants in the income section from the sale of patents in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed following the sale of Seinsberi pharmaceutical business (all 281 stores) by Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Farms network, for 125 million pounds three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a broad line of luxury care for each La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Seinsbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited special-skilled consultants who will always be ready to assist the Council.
Our brand assortment of any taste, pleasant design, and the comfortable availability of shops will attract many visitors to search for cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a new concept of the way to store.’
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willowby's "greed" out of 11 million pounds of sterling
The Lagovo Dragon show star, Peter Jones, was fired by Holly Willowby's mobile dating to 11 million pounds of sterlings, which she was planning to conclude with Peter's elevator brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowbi doesn't have time for their common brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
This couple's business was compared to the brand Goop actress Gunettet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old lead programme “Etem morning” announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowbi to leave their profitable elevator brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV led to the popularity of Peter Jones, the Lagowa Dragon star.
As our sources have reported, Jones was “infuriated” when a television fan at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that there would not be enough time after the conclusion of new contracts to hold up to 1.5 million dollars on their common brand of Truly clothes and accessories.
Their brand was compared with the child actress Gunettet Peltroo Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double increase Willowby's value of 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old leader announced his concern in Instagram, but he himself left Britain on a private plane for one of his villas.
According to one source, "Truly Mark was the main priority of Holly.
This was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next few decades.
Its decision has led to the level of all parties to the transaction.
They were all shocked by what happened on Tuesday, since the week before the start of the march was counted.
The entire warehouse, filled with goods ready for sale, remained in the headquarters of Marlow.’
Experts believe that one of the most popular stars of Britain's "Etem tomorrow" could be a company in millions of sterling pounds due to significant inputs into goods: from sweating and lights to clothing, as well as the potential delay in the start of the line.
It is also about breaking up old friendships.
The three children interviewed by Willowby and her husband, Dan Boldwin, had been married to Jones and his wife, Taro Kapp for 10 years.
Willowby set up a brand Truly with Taro Kapp in 2016, and Tari, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took the lead in the company in March.
Both couples often take vacations together, and in addition, Jones has 40 per cent of the shares of the company on television produced by Dan Boldwin.
Willowby will become a M&S mark agent and will replace Anthony Macparttlin as the lead translator of the ITV “I – Notitivity”.
A source from nearby Jones said last night: "We cannot comment on his business affairs".
Difficult negotiations, "and then we loved each other"
He questioned the criticism that the media were being subjected to because of the “indebt president” comment and the positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Tramp give up such a claim?
Trump said to support the voice of the leading news.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim Chen Yen was interested in the reconvened meeting after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June, a significant step towards a reduction of nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were in vain.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-level North Korean diplomat Li Yon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is still awaiting “responsive action” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States has noted a diplomat, which continues to use sanctions as a means of pressure.
During the meeting of his party, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“The North Korean case will be remarkable,” he said.
"We were at the border of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trapa, his efforts to build relationships with Kim Chen Inan brought fruit: the end of the rocket tests had been delayed, the hostages had been released, and the remaining US soldiers had also returned to their family.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Chen Inn, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing unusual.
“You know that you like the President so simply, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are in this whole murdered room, there would be 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Guns and landslides in Indonesia: catastrophic destructions are estimated by hundreds of victims
On the first day after the earthquake in Lombok, a foreign NGO said they did not need help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombo were left with headaches, the Government did not consider it necessary to announce a national disaster, which was mandatory for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly understood that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” explains Selina Sambung.
The "Saved Children" organization is preparing a mission to send to Palu, but we do not know if a foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopa, an official representative of the National Administration for Natural Disaster Reduction, Indonesia ' s leadership is making an assessment of the situation in Pala in order to determine the appropriateness of the involvement of international organizations.
In view of the continued seismic instability in Indonesia, the country has continued to be plagued by natural disasters.
Although tunnels have been built in Achehe, they are rarely found on other coastal lines.
Despite the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palu to inform the population that, most likely, there were so many victims.
The transport communication between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic, even in good weather.
Natural disasters add up to the challenge of logistics.
The swimming hospital previously rented in Lombok to assist the victims of earthquakes is headed to Palu, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made the main point of his pre-election campaign by strengthening the light infrastructure of Indonesia and spent countless resources on road and rail improvement.
However, the administration of President Joko, which has been embroiled for the next year, has been in financial trouble.
The Presidents also criticise the deepening of interconfessional enmity between the conservative majority of Muslims in Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were killed as a result of ties between Christians and Muslims, armed fighters, bullets and other suicides.

Mr. Cromwell, before Parliament's building, called for a serious discussion on the "rescription of history"
Cromwell's release would be a compensation for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell's memory community called Mr. Cricka's proposal “much” and “an attempt to re-write history”.
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell's Memory Society, said: “In the ongoing debate on the relationship of historical monuments, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Court is inevitable.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the economic movement during the British Civil Wars.
probably Oliver Cromwell suffers from the sins of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived a century ago.
The great imagery of the author of Sir William Hamo Tornikrovt reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of the human being, whom many have long regarded as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell the protector of the Parliament from external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
If such an opinion can be considered historically accurate, it remains the subject of expert debate.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that took place in the middle of the 17th century had influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve high appreciation and respect.”
The Chinese farmer killed a pig killer.
In one of the South-West markets, China's farmer became a victim of pigs, local media reported.
The body of the victim (only referred to in the media by his family, “Yuan”) with a broken artery was found on the market in the province of Lupanese province of Guyjou, southern China, and was reported by the Morning Post newspaper in the wake.
The pigs are ready to be herded into pigs on the pig farm on 30 May 2005, in the Chinese province of China.
Yuan and his two brothers came from the nearby province of Yuanan in the middle and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the two brothers discovered John’s lifeless body and opened the door to the neighboring prison.
The pigeon had a huge blood clot on its tail.
In the course of the trial, it was found that the pig had a weight of 250 kilograms of death by the farmer.

The body was found about time down.
The killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that they isolated the pig in a separate trap during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the family of Yuan is negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of a farmer.
Cases of dog attacks are common.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously traumatized a man.
Ten years ago, 300 kilograms of animal life brought the vulnerabilia to the tractor and left only with fear of a successful woman.
In 2012, a case was recorded when a farmer from Oregon, U.S.A., was accompanied by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “slow mechanism”.
"The Dogs of the Games,
They're cute and very cute, but they have no intention of trying you.
You should simply give your animal feelings of measure and respect," he explained.

The Senate hearings on the case of Judge Bretta Cavano saw more than 20 million views
The testimony of Brett Cavano and Cristina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted more than 20 million viewers of six telecommunications on Thursday.
The political opposition surrounding the candidacy of the Cavano received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent announcement was made in the media: the Republican Jeff Flyk had issued a condition for the FBI to investigate charges at the legal address within one week.
As the Forum stated in its hearings before the Senate Committee, it was convinced at “100 per cent” that Kawano had been attacked and tried to break it into school.
Cavano gave emotional evidence, stating that 100 per cent were convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the five-year debate was attended by more than 20.4 million observers.
The Agency took into account the average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels audits, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers watching television on work.
For comparison: it's about the middle audience following the American football match at the play-off or the Oskar hand ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, which led to the warm support of Cavano: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, had seen an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported the Nielsen agency.
Second, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS audited 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million viewers, while CNN reported that 2,52 million reviews had occurred.
After listening to the case, there is no weakness.
On Friday, this drama was played by Jeff Fleyk.
After a senator from Arizona, who was considered a moderate republic, reported his intention to support the candidature of CNN and CBS, he was able to print on the camera on Friday morning after meeting with a group of activists who were critical of the senator.
The whole world saw how he had lost his eyes, got fired from the women who had been raped in a direct ephemeral on CNN.
“ I am standing before you, ” said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
“You have the strength, while so many women are homeless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flick told activists that his office had already prepared a statement on this subject at the Committee's meeting, and the elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from the passenger cameras.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the candidature of Kawano as a judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels were translucent in the immediate ephere.
However, Flick provided one condition — the investigation by the FBI of these allegations against the candidate for the next week, as was the democratic minority.
Fleek claims that he changed his mind through the intervention of another Senator of the Democrats Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision by talking to Kansas and several other senators.
The Flicka decision had an effect, as it was evident that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa FBR, the investigation of the charges to Cavano was opened.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" around the situation with Bressit
In an interview with the Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union, of putting their share interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain is attending a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published in one field with the May interview, former MID leader Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Shasaki plan within Bressite, stating that it considers the introduction of customs consignments between Britain and the EU to be “absolutely ill”.

Volcano’s Peploma, Mexico
Volcano Popocatell buried the ashes of the southern Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico ' s National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not approach the volcano: its shortness of activity was recorded and 183 parasol emissions were produced.
According to the Centre’s observations, near the volcano, the throat was often broken and the feeling of discomfort was felt.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social networking users have published photos of cattle cars covered with thin paper.
After the earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics focused on participating volcanic activity within 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatell (or, for its sake, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police meetings with Catalan separatists prior to the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, Barcelona, a multi-month meeting on the first anniversary of the referendum on the departure of Spain from two camps was held in Spain. There were no discussions between the parties to independence and the police; six of the members of the riots were in custody.
Police officers have reduced the independence of the protesting parties, while the last ones in black masks have lost their hold on the eggs and onions, raising the cloud of dark dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police had released them into the basement to stop the crowd, the riots had been resumed with a new force.
For a number of hours, the party members of the party were scandalized and said: "We do not forget, nor do we forgive."
According to local press reports, fourteen of the participants were in the hospital with mild injuries.
On 1 October last year, a reference was made to the departure of Spain from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government but was important to separatists.
Catalonia had voted for the departure from Spain, but it was weak because the opposition to the exit had been largely blocked by the referendum.
According to the Catholic official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured during the last year in police attempts to block a referendum in the electoral areas of the country.
On Friday, the separatists engaged in the alleged follow-up of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to slow it down.
The demonstration was all the same, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electric Narcissian Termes, who visited the meeting of separatists in his wife's company, recalls that the hope of gaining the sovereignty of the Catalania is becoming increasingly bleak.
“In the past year, one of the most important events in our lives has occurred.
My parents were happy to have the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of subsidized state, ” he says.
In recent December elections in the local governing bodies of the Catholic parties serving in the Spanish office, they received important victories, even with small losses, but this year they lost the parties because many of the known leaders of the movement are either in the refugee or under custody, awaiting the court for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puch, 42-year-old machine recording on the phone meeting in support of the police, said that the conflict was under way by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The pressure increases,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junckeras, one of the nine leaders of Catholic separatists, at the end of last year's pre-trial detention, expressed his intention to vote in the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in regular elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he says.
London: The car broke into the house, all three of them were arrested
One of the houses in Londonbury was hit by a car several times; men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The visit was held on Thursday at about 19:30 p.m. on local time in the Ballinagard Crest.
As a result, Taran was damaged by the door and the same building, police inspector Bob Bloomings reported.
There are reports that the car could have been pulled out of the truck.
Livingstone's victory over the Rangers thanks to the Mengi bullet
The first round of Dolly Mengi brought the promised victory of the Livingstone team
Thanks to the lost sword, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the principal coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerard, this is the only second hit for 18 games.
The real hit by Dolly Mangi was compared to the Harry Holt team with the Hibernian club in the accounting table where they were second.
Jérard's club has not won this season in Premier League, and they have a meeting with the leaders of the group, Harts, from which Rangers stays on eight o'clock.
On Thursday, Rangers will take part in their field of the League of Europe with the Austrian Ravid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its inexhaustible series in the division, has already played six matches and has not won any victories since Holt changed Kenny Miller to the team's chief coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in the Face of Enforced Guests
Colta's trusted trainers had to report from the very beginning that the Rangers had obviously not responded to their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of protection, but the goal of his weak attempt failed.
The host party allowed Rangers to play before their protection line, considering the dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers launched a free strike, and Livingstone used the opportunity: Declan Gallager and Robinson transferred Menge from the central position.
At the time, the Rangers were proud to have a sword, but the protection of the host team was unwarranted, so the commander of Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second team continued on the same scheme, although Kelly had yet to escape the attack by Alfredo Morelos.
Reinggers Lord McGregor threw his sword out of Scott Pittman, and Litgo made a broad statement from the standard.
The sword has always fallen into the punishment of Livingstone, but all the attacks have been reflected, and two criminal requirements — one for the promotion of Glenn Middleton Hallkett’s game and the other for the game’s hand — have not been met.
"Fenomial" game "Livingstone" — Analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, a report from the "Toni Makaroni Arena" stadium
The final game and the excellent result for the team Livingstone.
All the games were absolutely great, and all the expectations continued to come from the Olympics.
Their style of games and composition has not changed practically since their origin to the top of the ratings, and the great reward of Coach Holt has been that he has mobilized this command from the very beginning.
There were no heroes in his team.
Captain Halquet led a highly organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Warall to weaken.
At the same time, the Rangers couldn't go to the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with trainer Gerard, they did not justify our expectations this time.
In the last few minutes, the fighter did not catch them with a sword, but only once did they pass the protection of the host team. The Rangers, who disappeared in the middle of the table, is what they think about.
A cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Kalen
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a wonderful time, and both of them were in excellent shape.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties — the visit and without any conflict.
Heads of State failed to understand such issues as human rights, freedom to print and entry Turkey into the EU.
After Erdogan was sent to Kelne to participate in the ceremony in opening a huge new dream.
There is the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey in Kelne.
In terms of security, the police did not allow a 25,000 crowd to enter the tomb, but many of the Erdogan parties were at a distance to see their President.
At the same time, the opposition to the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, was brought together in full to condemn both Erdogan ' s policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically contradictory points of view at the meeting reflects the different significance of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider it a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: A car crash led to the death of a passenger
In London, a car met a bus driver who ended up at the scene.
The accident took place near Beswiud Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossing into the southeastern part of Deport, about 10:15 a.m. on local time.
The driver of the car and those who came to the hospital tried to help the bus driver, but the man did not come to the realization.
This is not the only accident with deadly consequences in this area: all in a mile from the scene, on the streets of Chailders Street, another passenger was hit by a car that had been hit by a driver.
The London Police report that work is currently being done to identify the deceased and to inform its immediate relatives.
As long as the road is open and the bus route is changed, car drivers are asked not to travel in this area.
Long-Lartin Prison Unordered: Six Police Victims
According to the Long Lartine Administration, six police officers were injured during male arrests.
In the male prison of Long-Lartin (Wustershire), there are ongoing riots involving about 09:30 local time.
The Tornado Opportunity was created to deal with irregularities involving eight prisoners from one wing.
The police had suffered minor injuries to mild tissues; they had been given medical care at the site.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff have been attracted to permit the incident at the Long Lartin correctional facility.
Six of them got traumas.
We are categorically opposed to the use of physical force in our institution, and it is evident that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and their restraining measures can be changed for a longer time.”
There are currently more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartine, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the media reported that the manager of the prison had fallen into the hospital following an attack by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prison leadership was forced to attract special appointment units to calm down the frustrated prisoners who were throwing billiard charges into the supervisors.
Uragan Rosa can warm Fenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the freezing areas)
Arison rarely falls into the area of the intense tropical cycle, but this time it has been ‘increased’: at the beginning of the next week, hurricane Rose made its last fishing trip to the desert part of the South-West.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of river floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and in the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in southern California and Utah, including in such cities as Fenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that hurricane Rosa will cross the direct line over Phoenix on Tuesday and disappear on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service Office in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical heat or depression since 1950 at 320 km radius of Phoenix.
Uragan Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.’
According to the latest estimates of the National Meteorological Service, there are from 5 to 10 cm of seats, up to 15 cm on the Mogolon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible that up to 2.5-5 centimetres may reach 10 centimetres.
For areas where river currents will be on the other side, the rain caused by the rose can be a blessing because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although wet streams may pose a danger, wet rains may facilitate the dry season in the South-West United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona's territory is considered to be at least strong drought (second by weight),” reports the website weather.com.
At the beginning of the hurricane, Rosa is moving to the Mexican state of South California.
As early as the morning of the resurrection, the hurricane, at a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Euhenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Uragan has been in the area with more colder water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the second half of the day, hurricanes will reach Mexico in the category "tropical storm".
It is expected that in certain areas of Mexico there will be massive flooding.
“In the territory of the South California to the north-west of Sonora, it may take up to 7 to 10 cm of crops, up to 25 cm,” reports the website weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will move north through the territory of Mexico, and early Tuesday morning he will come to the border with Arizona in the tropical cycle category. From Arizona he will come to the south of Utah to the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk associated with the hurricane Rose and its remnants is the strong hurricanes in South California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert areas of the South-West United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The settlements are expected to result in dangerous flooding, drought flows in the desert and possible use in the mountainous areas.

Donald Tramp: "In Cavano, all hatred, all evil" of democracies
"The voice of Judge Cavano is the voice against the cruel and degrading tactics used by democracy," Tramp said to his colleagues in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trapa, the Democratic Party ' s "all hatred, all evil" has been violated in the process of approving the nomination of Cavano for a candidate.
On Thursday, Cavano gave evidence at the United States Congress, in his emotional response he categorically rejected Christina Blazi Ford's accusation that he had been sexually abused more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also provided evidence during her hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day “the American people saw a shining mind, class and courage” in Cavano.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Cavano – the vote for the approval of one of the most promulgating lawyers of our time, with an unstoppable public service list”, the president of the crowd of his colleagues in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President spoke frankly about the appointment of Cavano, referring to the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the elections at the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important choices in our life remain for five weeks.
I don’t participate in them, but that’s why I’m involved in the race in a different sense, ” he said.
"I wear like a gorilla and fight for our different candidates."
Tripp believes that Democrats have set themselves up to “all the forces to give us resistance”.
According to the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of the candidature of Cavano should be held not later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party was informed.
The earthquake in Indonesia has resulted in hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had been caught by giant waves covering the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, where the incredible power of tsunamis and earthquakes had broken down.
The first victims became hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday, the walls of the castle reached a height of almost six metres, which gave rise to the death of many of the attendance.
The tsunami followed the magnitude 7.5 on Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running away immediately and lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Administration for Natural Disaster Reduction at the Jakarta press conference.
“The tsunamis did not come alone, there were cars, bridges, houses, and everything was destroyed on their way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and swept across the coast with all their might.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerophotoscopic management of the effects of natural disasters has seen destroyed homes, shops, damaged bridges, and heated gravel.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still covered by underground mud.
A series of earthquakes occurred in areas with 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of the Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the resulting landslide of energy had occurred about 200 times more than when the nuclear bomb destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have been stronger than expected because of the geographical situation of the city at the end of the long rainy season.
Nogroho called the damage “mass”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hospitals have been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were discovered under the ruins of damaged buildings; all of the injuries were received by 540 people, and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast of Pala, 300 km away, in the town of Dongal, which was near the earthquake.
The communication from Dungala was “completely destroyed, no information has been received”.
“More than 300 thousand people live in the Danube region”, reports the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been in the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it has not yet been reached”, says the report.
On Saturday, the Office was critical of the fact that it did not report the arrival of tsunamis in Palu. However, the authorities believe that the waves reached the shore when the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks have shown a love video in which a man at the top of the building shouts about the overcrowding tunnels, attempting to attract attention on the street.
After a few minutes on the beach, the wall of water breaks down, the entire house and the car are connected.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this role.
The earthquake and tsunamis have resulted in a huge supply of electricity, which has resulted in the loss of connections in Palu, which has made it very difficult for rescue services to operate.
From Jakarta and other cities, military transport aircraft were deployed with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and supplies for the first time, government sources reported.
The city airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
At the resurrected evacuation centres in Palu, President Joko Vidodo will visit.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity organization came from Dungala to Palu, where they found refuge in the bronze palaces that were destroyed at the door of their office.
“ They saw a great many destroyed homes, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Humanitarian assistance mechanisms have begun to be implemented by charitable organizations, but many complain that international NGOs have failed to escape to Pala.
Indonesia ' s legislation permits funding, humanitarian assistance and staff from foreign organizations only after the site has been declared to be affected by the nature of the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that it is a local disaster,” reports Aulia Ariani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares natural disaster to be national, we can accept foreign aid, but until the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the missing people, they still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will bring the people of faith to a better place.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued who fell into a canal hole.
In the resurrection, rescuers pulled out of the roofs of the building of a woman who had spent two days there, along with her mother's lifeless body.
Hendon Subbandon, trainer of the National Assembly of Indonesia on paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots to recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Among the other people who fell into the trap at the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandy.
“ I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive, ” he said.
Hendon recalls how, after learning about the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel by other parapolanists, he had been desperately trying to contact his colleagues at the beach festival for the next few hours.
However, his messages were accompanied by one series of lead, not two holes.
“This means that the communications were not delivered”, he says.

Canyon West: Repper changed its name
Repper Canyea West has come up with a new name: Yes.
On Saturday he announced on Twitter: “A person known as Kanya West”.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing it as a pseudonym and has even put it in the name of its eighth album, which went up in June.
News of this occurred in advance of Kenya's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kenya West will speak in favour of the song Aryan, which has rejected its participation because of “emotional experiences”, reports the transfer author.
West earlier stated that dogs were not only reduced by the variant of his name but also had a religious meaning.
“ Yes is the most frequently encountered word in the Bible, it means ‘ yes, ’ ‘ yes, ’ ” West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews with Big Boy.
"It's me. It's you. I'm us.
It was Kanya, which means “one, ” and now I — all of it — is the reflection of the best, the worst, the worst thing we can do right now.
And this is a trial for those of us who are like this."
Canya is not the first known rapper to decide to change his name.
Sean Combs, previously known as Paf Deddie, Pi Diddie or just Didi, this year he asked to call himself Lava (love) or Brazza Lava (brother Love or Brother Love).
A spokesman with Westo Repper J. Zi also changed his name several times: with a defiance and without, in written letters or drawings.
The President of Mexico strongly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador of Mexico has promised never to escape to the military force against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ended with the bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised “never to fly to the army to help the Mexican people. ”
At this site, on 2 October 1968, the first explosions were dropped by the crowd and 300 people were killed. This was in front of the strengthening of left student movements in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised to support the Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for training and opening up a large number of free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for education lead young people to a criminal world.
United States dollars need to double funding for the development of II
China and its efforts in the field of artistic intelligence (II) should not be underestimated. The United States should double investment in its scientific development, according to Li Kaifu, the II investor and entrepreneur with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previous statements on work on IE have been made by several American ministries, although in general the United States does not have a clear development strategy for II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal was to become the first in IE innovation by 2030.
“The increase in IE research budget would be a good start twice, given that all other countries are far from the United States, and we expect the next break in II,” says Li.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be made in the United States, said Li CNBC during this week.
Li, whose book "The Superstition of Art: China, the Crimea Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General for Innovation Ventures who invested in one of China's largest publishing companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon on an art intelligence system that was the highest in the U.S. Hotel and then the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Did he mention previous government technology competitions in the United States, for example, Robotics Challenge Defense Advanced Research Projects, and he was interested in the next competition to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, students in the United States often have to work hard to get government loans.
“Not China is the leader of academics, but corporations,” Li convinced.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been looking for lights from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Are you convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence?
“I think that the Green Card should automatically be offered to artistic intellectual candidates,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published the next generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
China's National Natural Science Fund grants scientific funding in the same way as the National Science Fund and other government organizations lend money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is below, according to Li.
Earlier this year, the Ministry of Defence of the United States has established a United Nations Art Centre, where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House has announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Art.
This month DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next programme.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
Meanwhile, the legislation of the United States, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in favour of the referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece which blocked its applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has imposed a veto for its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name proposal, but nationalists claimed that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign of the fighter questioned whether the voter ' s wish would meet at least 50 per cent of the referendum required.
The question raised at the referendum was as follows: "Do you support NATO and the EU membership under the terms of the treaty with Greece?"
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a more secure life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgiev, Skopje resident.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would observe the results of the vote in order to make it a decision, although it did not have a legally binding force.
A change of name will require a majority in two thirds of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the gap was 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, president of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, and his son Dosko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, opening the way for it to enter NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the building of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the halls set up by the citizens who are going to ban the referendum.
"We are members of NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high-level head rather than defeat the official cabinets," Kawadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of own dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would invest in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be due to the fact that more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “because of our good future”.
The question published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the requirement.
A second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on the agenda.
70 per cent of this figure claims to be positive.
For the referendum to take place, the light should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western Government ' s policy since it came to power last May.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City protects Briton to kill the Gol
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought with the protection of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory with account 2:0 on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero killed a bullet at 65 minutes, it was said that he had no job.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got a dog in the center of the field.
He walked between the three Britons before going to open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four contestants in green football.
He attacked one protector and attacked several more at the end of the Briton penal zone.
He then transferred the Starling sword to the left.
The English attacker in the penal area returned the sword of Aguero, which was shot by the right-hand Briton, Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
"Aguero is experiencing some leg problems," said the coach Manchester City, Pope Guardiola.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It's been our fault that he killed a bullet at the time."
But it was Sterling that gave the first advantage in the fight against the Prime Minister.
That bullet was killed at 29 minutes.
In this game Aguero got a sword, deep in the Briton territory.
He's got a great deal on the left-hand side of Leroy Sane.

Sherzer is going to pick up the eyes at Colorado Rockies.
There was no special reason to force the events after Washington Nachionals had emerged from the playoff battle.
But the inautomatic Sherzer hopes to take up the fight against Colorado Rockys in the resurrection, but only if Rokis, who competes in one Los Angeles Dogers in the West Division, starts the playoffs.
At least 7 or 8 seats have been won by the Nesionals on Friday night, but they are still hoping to secure their title in the first division.
“And although we are simply playing this, at least we can maintain positions, knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denmark in the presence of observers and another team, probably unprecedented in this year.
How can I miss this?"
"Nesionals" has not yet declared the drinker to be resurrected, but, according to the latest data, it is difficult for Sherzer to play this role.
Sherzer, who's going out for the 34th game, threw a sword on the table for the drinkers on Thursday, and on the resurrection, on his way out, he'll be a drinker.
The statistics of the Washington realtors – 18-7 with ERA rating 2,53 and 300 cars in 220,2/3 innings in the current season.
Trap conducts a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republicans' participation in the interim elections, the President recently referred to the situation around Bretta Cavano, a candidate appointed by the President of the Supreme Court.
"All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices in our lives.
That's very, very important, and I don't run, even though I'm really running, I'm fighting for good candidates."
Tripp continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that is happening right now.
And they are determined to return their power using any means they need, and we observe the landscape and the tide.
All that they try to do is to gain power and control over them. They want to gain power and control, but we are not going to give them away."
Democrats, he claims, have set the goal of “resisting and stopping”.
"And you will observe it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "wicked, mean, stupid and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to Senator Diane Fynstein, who caused a massive vote from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?

Mmm... mmm... what paper?
No, no, the tongue of the body has gone out of her, I have never seen the tongue of the body speak so much as its speech.’
The Liberian Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not show tolerance for those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists at my local party offered me an offer of a vodka of mistrust, it was not unexpected.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Leiborist Party who have not yet shown that we are not welcome for expressing our opinion.
A similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by my vodka for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — the irony of the trial — is the issue that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The Notting East Liberian Congregation was informed on Friday that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight-year stay as a local member of the parliament of the Liberian Party was attended by the GC Friday evenings.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not consistent with those many meetings, but the promise of “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Liberian party is becoming more and more obvious, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party ' s leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whom I previously viewed as my own political perspective were expected to change my views and take a position I would never agree with — whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time after my public statement, which I am speaking, it is not important that I speak of, in social networks, there should be a wave of disturbances that call for the abolition of elections that judge the policy of the centre or claim that I should not be a member of the Liberian Party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
In fact, I know that I have had more than some of my colleagues because my comments in my address still tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are facing each day with sexual or racist attacks but never give up.
Most of all, this policy is disappointed by the fact that such a number of abuses have become considered normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Liberian party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a "large church" and with every wave of mistrust or change of the party's rules of choice has already become.
For the past two years, I have received many recommendations that call for me to sit quietly and express myself, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Liberians 32 years ago, as a student of the school charged with the anti-fraud behaviour of the Government of Tetcher, which my school class had literally broken down, I have tried to stand up to the highest level of public services for those who need most of them — whether the work of a local MP or the Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political views, I've never done this in the past.
No one in the Eastern Notting could misjudge my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
Those who supported this vote on Friday would like to say this: our country is moving to Brexit, which is guaranteed to have an economic, industrial and public uranium, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact, the only audience I'd like to call is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are liberal or not: I'm proud that I serve you, and I promise that no threat of canceling the results of the elections or of political goodwill will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interests.

Er 38 - 17 Melrous: The Unconquered Er comes first
Two late attempts may have yielded a few final results, but, no doubt, Er earned triumph in this surprisingly interesting game of Prime Minister Tennt.
Now they're leading a table, the only unbeatable team of ten.
Finally, thanks to their superior protection, as well as their ability to choose the necessary moment, which gave the host team and trainer Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for integrity, and we are still not successful, so I have no reason to complain, ” commented Peter Merci.
Robin Cristy, Melrose, says: "It's about to give up "Ere," they've been better looking after us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment, carried out by Freser Climo, led to an "Er" front, but the jealous card released for the game "Voriors" by Scottish player Rory Hüss allowed Melrous" to move forward, and Jason Baggot was caught up in an unrealistic attempt.
The climate has increased Er's share of punishment before, directly in the middle of the game, it has earned an eye, and then in the break it has carried out a single test, making it 17-5 for Er's benefit.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggoto reduced the gap to five.
It was then a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who received the extension, and after the re-examination, Ere was further moved by the trial of Stafford McDouale, who was committed to the climate.
The current Captain "Er" Blair McFerson then received a yellow card, and Melrouz again persuaded the opponents to pay a regular game for an unconquered attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of intense pressure.
Nevertheless, the economy returned, and when Straan Hatchinson received a wish card to capture the climate without a cat with a fine line, Macferson made a tachdown behind the coming "Er".
The climate has made a difference, not from the most recent exit, after Kyle Rou got hit by David Armstrong and sent the final attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt on the field.
The Still Game Star is going to start a new career in restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which he writes on, and is filmed together with former comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
Dooet announced that the next nine series would be the last in the show and that Kirnan was planning a life after Craigong.
According to official information, he is Director of Apionmorn Limited.
The Actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of Scottish Sun insisted that Kirnan planned to participate in the "producing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: There is no way out of Bolivia hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol the warhead in La Pase.
The public buildings are covered with massive flags.
The military-sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by a slogan: "We are on our right.
It is our duty to bring him back to us."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a living memory of the coastal line lost in Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of its resources; life and effort are resuspending on the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the most bold over the past decade, as Bolivia is awaiting international court decisions, which will be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and mental balance and, of course, is looking forward to a positive outcome here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many patients will observe the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal would be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of negotiations, Chile has been obliged to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who is leading a simple re-election battle next year, also looks forward to the decision that will be taken on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not take advantage of Bolivia, and if that happens, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to extend the Chilean territory and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case was “not complex”, says Pas Zarate, an expert in international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia has not moved, but it has always been.
“The current administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
In her words, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welte, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree that the court's decision was made too quickly.
The Monday will provide Bolivia with “the exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disagreement with the protracted benefit”, he says.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, still uses the military-sea problem as a political cause.
“Bolivia has never denied its right to access the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is another opportunity to make sure that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not be until it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yon Ho says that his country will never be able to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri made a statement at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the summit in Singapore between the leaders of its countries.
His comments are based on the gradual return of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the process of restoring the silent nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Inno.
Rí argues: The dream that long-term sanctions and hate of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be placed on the North side of the hill — that is a bribe.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if Phanyan does not take significant steps to disarmament.
And Kim, and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But scepticism because Phanyan is seriously involved in the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trampa.
Paris fashion shows a new line of massive headgears that promise to appear in mass sales and will carry them directly with you
If you want to add shoes to your collection or to protect yourself from sunglasses, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual head coverings that are part of their SS19 collections and blind visitors to Paris' fashion week.
This year, the most unprofessional steps led to the popularity of Instagram signers, and the designers decided to launch their snowflakes on the floor.
A different example of Valentino: the main escape team, decorated with large fields like the first one, wore on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included decorated goldstones of arbus, ivory and even pineapple pineapples, but not all of these head coverings were intended for freezing the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also came to peace with a collection of wonderful masks, which had come to become Hellouin's poison.
Many of these wooden masks were covered with teeth, and they remembered the portrait of Gannibal Lector rather than the creation of the kitchen.
One of the specimens mentioned the waterproofing of a tube and a protective eye, while the other was a growing ice cream.
If you are a worshiper of the highest order, it will be your duty to do so.
The fashion critics predict that these huge steps have all the chance of breaking into a mass sale — directly to you.
The large-scale ladders come from the five La Bomba, a wooden ladder with two wide fields that have already been expected from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultural label released by this extremely unprofessional trap, which has led to such widespread popularity in social networks, has produced and led to another huge accessories — a solemn beach bag, almost as large as the buyer’s own model, missing.
The orange bag with a white leather glove and an octopus from the raffle became a clear example of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on Sunday of fashion in Paris.
Selebritist Luke Armitaz explains the issue of FEMAIL: “I think large shoes and beach bags will appear in mass sales next year. Since the designer has produced such a forum by his productions, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to people of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of advancing education, which was confirmed again in 2018: the results of the exams have shown individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public-interest disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, and are striving to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education chosen by them as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that current languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, then you call him to mind.
If you speak with him in his native language, you will surely turn to him in repentance."
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
As a result of the last exams this year, we see that languages are leading positions in the league tables and have the highest ball as a result of independent school exams.
In total, 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a higher rating of A.
The data received from 74 SCIS school members showed that 72 per cent of students received A in Mandarin (name of Chinese), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A.
This proves that in independent schools of Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly important for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are currently being used with the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
The question raised by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a key to a successful future career for young people.
In view of the fact that more prospective jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what a student may choose, if he learns a second language, he will receive a real advantage in the future, developing another skill that will be acceptable to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitive advantages.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language well enough to support the discussion, and French had become the only language with two per cent — 15 per cent of respondents.
That's why investment in language education is so current.
The knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, gives children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, there is a wide range of language courses that are taught — each school has its own language set.
A number of schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are most important to Britain in the light of the country's future development by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, in independent schools, he or she will always choose from a number of languages with a teaching component whose members are experts in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland are trying to create an environment of education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that language is still vital for the future development of the country in the global business environment, so that this should be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “artificials of the international community”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice to ensure diversity and advantages for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
Lebron Debt in Lakers at San Diego
The dark anticipation of fans will see how Lebron James will first appear in Los Angeles Lakers, almost at the end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a pre-resurrection match against Daver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still needs to figure out how much time he has to play.
"More than one and less eight," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James is playing a limited amount of time.
After training this week, James asked about his plans for six pre-school games in Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-school games to prepare for the season,” replied the player.
Trampa pre-emptive race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp starts his pre-election meeting tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings of Trapa the following week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate proposed by the Supreme Judge was postponed, Trapp sought support in the forthcoming interim elections because the Republicans were at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote was held in November.
How many evenings will it take to meet Trapa in West Virginia, and how can you watch her online?
The meeting with Trampo in Wiling, West Virginia, will be held at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trampa meeting with the Western Virgins online online online via direct transmission to YouTube.
The trauma is likely to be heard this week in order to move his candidate Bretta Cavano to the post of Supreme Judge. The proposal of this candidate has led to a mass of negative reactions, as Kawano has been accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken in Senate will be postponed for a week until the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans of the November elections to take a pre-election step.
Thus, President Trampa's campaign was aimed at helping those five meetings to be held next week to “increase the activities of volunteers and parties, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in Senate and House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“The control over the Congress is so important for its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, as we are entering the difficult pre-election season,” reports the press secretary of the Trampa pre-election campaign, who has refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinge may attract "...Ogyo and Pennsylvania and attract attention to Pittsburgh Media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to the West Virginia Train this Saturday is already the second visit of the State in the last month, since it has benefited more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tripp is trying to assist a candidate in the Senate of the West Virgin Patrick Morris, who is left behind as a result of the investigations.
“The fact that Morrisi is beginning to compete for interviews must come from the President – a bad sign for Morrisi himself,” says Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia (citizen from Reuters).
Kubok Rydera 2018: The United States of America is ready to fight and hopes to be resurrected to male meetings
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game, two to two, may have been what Kubok Ryder needed.
The passing initiative is an outstanding sport concept, but it is believed in games, and it is very clearly expressed at such events.
So who's taking the initiative?
“ They had a advantage in six glasses, and now four, so I think this is a small initiative for us,” Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has four advantages, and twelve more horses.
The Americans, according to Sputa, feel “air in Paris” and have reason to keep the spirit high, not least thanks to the form of Sputa and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can be praised with three eyes of four.
The trial was kept from you to the grey than he had given his personal example.
The winning voices became all over the crowd as his round continued, beating the decisive sword into the moon, closing the ball when they joined Thomas two to two.
His hit in the game on the 15th of June was met with a similar vote, one of which was about his faith in a chance for the American team.
“We need to meet with all our strengths and focus only on our game,” said Spit.
That's all that's left of the game right now.
Go 18 months and become winners.
The only games that have played in the last two days are Spit and Thomas, the French Molinary and Tommy Fletwood, who have never been involved in the history of the Kubka Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe picked up four of them, and it seems they don't know the mistake.
They were the only couple who didn't call the gods on the Sabbath, but they also avoided the gods on the Sabbath morning, on the Friday day, and again on the Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy appears to circle between them and non-existent patients, strengthens the faith that they will not win in the resurrection, and when the sun falls behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous game that will strengthen Europe's potential to win than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be good if both were on different moons at the same time.
However, we are talking about the glory of Europe in advance.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got in touch with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the game in four dogs when he was in a match with Alex Noren.
The gods and two gods on the first nine moons shot the Spanish and the Swedish, from which they were unable to draw.
So no one in the resurrection will help you to get out of your darkness.
So it is interesting to watch the game in four cats and four games because of the interaction between the couple, the councils they exchange, which aim to reduce and how the strategy can be changed in one direction.
At the same time, Europe played a better role as a team, and was very much moving forward on the last day, but this four-day session also showed that the United States had all the fighting forces in which some, especially in America, had doubted.
On the final day, Kubka Rider of Europe is headed by account 10-6
Europe will receive a sense of advantage on the final day of Cuba Riyadh after the end of the sub-units in four cats and four out of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired poets Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods in order to bring the account into Le Golf National to the four corners.
The European team of Thomas Bourne, wishing to return the lost one to Haselin two years ago, dominated the American team's potential failure in the early four-morning games, winning with account 3-1.
The United States dollar has been more opposed to the four, won two matches, but they have not been able to reduce the gap in account.
Commander Jim Férica needs eight o'clocks from 12 o'clock in the morning to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novel that won four rounds, while he and Molinari, who received the name "Mollivud" after the sensory exits, became the only second pair who won four in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Ryder.
The Woods and Patrick Ridd played in four battles, and then they were greatly united to win over the fallen Woods and the American newsmagazine Bryceno with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who spent two Saturdays, showed periodicals, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four dogs and four quarters in seven rows.
Justin Rose, who was in the early four-morning game, returned to the parlor of Henry Stanson on Thursday, won Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with 2/1, taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, however, the game did not become a light and pleasant walk on a refreshing day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas champions on Saturday became two targets for Americans.
They won a decisive victory with account 2/1 over Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the game in four cats and returned later to play Polter and Rory Makilroy with account 4/3 in four, lost the first two moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Ryder, the team was fired from four eyes, leaving alone, bearing in mind that the Férica team, as I do, had to play at night in order to maintain the trophies.
After two days of detention, however, the contract in the resurrection appears to be limited.
North Korea said that “categorian” would not be deployed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen confidence in the United States and that its country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
RI Yon Ho declared to the General Assembly annually that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of good will” last year, such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of nuclear weapons and the obligation not to increase nuclear weapons stocks and not to develop nuclear technologies.
“So we don’t observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to take the first disarmament action unilaterally.”
While Rí repeated the already heard North Korean complaints against Washington ' s "step" approach to denuclearization, which would be rewarded by the steps taken by North Korea, his statement was important in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phanyan had done in the past.
Rí referred to a joint statement made by Kim Chen Yin and Donald Tramp at the first in history between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader who took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start the movement on the part of the "Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States claims that Phanyan should start to withdraw from his nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call for weak international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that “the beginning must be nuclearized”, and increase pressure through sanctions in order to enforce its objective, and even oppose “the declaration of end of war”, says Rei.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on the knees is an utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But this problem is that continuing sanctions strengthen our mistrust.”
Rí did not mention plans for the second high-level meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Munja Inan, who took place in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea were on the side of this issue, and not the United States, the Korean peninsula would not be in such a hurry”.
However, the tone of Ri's words was very different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that the target of North Korea's rocket on the U.S. mother was inevitable after "Mr. President of Evil" Trapp called Kim a "smobby rocket".
This year in the United Nations Trap, which had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was released.
In the middle of the trip, he said that he did not indicate any time-limits for the process: “If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Phanyan for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions to the Security Council must continue actively and legally until we see the complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has consistently strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to opening up the funding of the Pacific nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Rei at the UN General Assembly summits and reported after that meeting that he would visit Phanyan again next month to prepare for the second high-level meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed.
In July he left Phanyan, said that progress had been made, but for a few hours after that visit North Korea had condemned him for “banditic requirements”.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Muna this month to detonate the rocket and the nuclear package if the United States would take "the appropriate measures".
Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax at special courses
This year's new course at Harvard University helped all students to learn to sleep more and to fight against the uninterrupted entertainment culture of caffeine with a view to creating a “night shift”.
One of the academics explained that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and clinic specialist Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in his own generation in the United States.
After his opening, he was angry at the idea of introducing such a course by giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deficiencies on the learning process.
"At the end of my report a girl came to me and said, 'I'm sorry I only knew about it now that I'm almost finished.'
She said that she had never talked to her about the importance of sleep — which impressed me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, tells how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success and how it improves the overall sense of human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University of Health, says that the university decided to introduce this course after it had been made clear that students are experiencing a serious shortage of sleep during the school week.
Over the course of one hour, students are carrying out a number of interactive tasks.
One of the employment sections offers a picture of a room in the community where students, sitting on coffee cups, chairs, coaches and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and sleep - causing a lack of sleep — affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In the second section, participants will learn how long sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages the participants to think about their daily life.
“We understand that these activities will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health, ” added Professor Chesler.
In his statement, the false sense of pride that a person can “go all night” is still quite widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is a problem.
According to him, enough sleep is a “secret weapon” of a student to deal with stress, nervousness and anxiety, and even to deal with a loss of weight, since the lack of sleep translates the brain into a state of hunger, making it constantly try to feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesleru to develop a course that he visited one of his first year of education in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the camp.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all the experts to conduct a similar training program before entering a competitive training facility.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set up a vigilante warning that they should sleep and swim, as well as remind themselves of the harmful effects of the "green light" of electronic screens and light-dark lamps that violates human bureaucracy and leads to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins over the command of Gerard
The Rangers survived a series of printed visits, as Dolly Menga led the unaccompanied team of Steven Gerard to defeat with 1:0 in Livingstone.
Commander Aybroxa hoped to win his first victory after winning the 4-1th in February in St. Johnston, but Commander Gary Holta had only won the second defeat of Gerard of 18 games as manager, leaving his team on the 8th floor, giving him the easy victory of the Harts team to the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga died in seven minutes before the break, and the Reingers, who lost the spirit, seems to have failed to balance the account.
While Rangers was now on the sixth floor, Livingstone was on the third floor, and only Hibernian was on the way to the head.
The Rangers may also have additional problems after Judge Kalum Spence has had an injury on his head after an item has been removed from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in a team that passed through Er in a semi-final for the Scottish League.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livi 11 strategy, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-trained composition strengthen the opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have led the sword, but Livingstone survived more when the sword fell on them.
They were supposed to kill a bullet every two minutes when the first transmission of Menga Scott Pittman to God was stopped by McGregor, but the guard used the chance.
Kigan Jackobs had a criminal attack on Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, had only managed to send a sword to the side of the next stage.
The Rangers took control, but in the last three, it seems there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to be a criminal attack for forty-five minutes when he and Stephen Lawles met, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers did all two hits in the first team, but the former leader of Aybrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly worried about the attack by Lassan Kolibali on his head, and the weak hit by Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livi, which was killed for 34 minutes, may not have been in line with the game, no one can deny that they had earned it solely by their own efforts.
But once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' game from the standard position.
Scott Ardfield didn't respond when Declan Galler gave Scott Robinson a sword, trying to pass it on to Menga to finish.
Gerard began to act on the break when Kolibali changed to Ryan Kent, and such an exchange almost immediately resulted in the final attack on the Morelos passport but the impressive Kelly got out of her line to pick up.
But Livingston continued to attract guests into their intended game with Litgo and Halkett, a constant process of long-term transfers.
The Holta team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgo left the field.
The Rangers game, Glenn Middleton, required a penalty strike after he met Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
Almanah: Writer of the Geiger accountant
And now the page of our German Friday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago in Germany was born by the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gans.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger accountant.
As one of the basis of science, the Geiger account also became one of the basis for popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950's film Coloko Coronado, with the likes of Rogers and Dale Evans, who said that they were not like scientists, in particular:
Man says: "What is the matter with this?
Rogers said: “This is the Geiger accountant used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you hope for these particles, you can actually hear the effects of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans says, "Well, now that's right!"
Hans Geeger died in 1945, not a few days before he was 63.
But its invention, called its author's honour, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to see anatomical cells
A new anticancer vaccine can learn the immune system to see an anaemic growth cells and kill them.
Part of the vaccine’s treatment is to learn about the immune system to identify anatomical cells
Method is used to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells have the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then cells must be returned to 0
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one patient who has been infected with this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize anatomical cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which modified cells may “see” the HER2 protein, which is characterised by many cancers, and then re-initiate modified cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifezda, Maryland, says: "The results we have received are intended to have a very promising vaccine"
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, mild and colorectal cancer.
The same method has been used successfully in the treatment of leukemia, which has been included in the collection of immune cells in patients and their “training” as it should affect cancer cells.
Kanya West spoke in defense of Trappa in the MAGA case after he appeared in SNL.
It's all gone bad.
Kanya West was informed in a study during the sub-concentration he held in the protection of US President Donald Trampa, claiming that he would take this post again in 2020.
After the performance of his third song, entitled "Horod-Pirzrak", he performed what he wore the title "We're making America a great again," the performer spoke against democracy and supported Trapa.
"I talk to white people often and they ask me, 'How can you support the trumpet, and he's a racist?'
Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, ” said the executive.
The SNL channel conducted a family show with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star had introduced Bretta Cavano to the Senate Court Committee on Christina Blaise Ford's Statements on Sexual Harassment.
They did not show how the crowd was upset by Westa's speech, but they were loaded into social networks by Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear whether Rock tried this step to take West.
In addition, West appealed to the public for having his hat cut off by the bullets.
"They came up to me behind the stage.
They're saying, don't get out of this bag.
They were really hanging out on me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying: "And yet they said that my position is not cruel."
He will say, "Do you want to know that there is no power over anything so that no one can tell you what to do?
Then you will be loved."
At least twice, his comments drew attention to the audience, SNL members were said to be disoriented, and one person said: “All studies were loaded into silence.”
Weesta has recently been invited to replace the song by Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Many have found it challenging to perform Westo's "I Love it" song in Perrier's boots.
West received support from the head of TPUSA Kendis Turner Conservative Group, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: SPASSIBO FOR MANY SUPPORTS”.
Karen Hunter's lead show wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and it's absolutely remarkable".
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation), who, in my view, divides and spreads the ideology that is valuable to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “formally known as Kanya West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and go to the feet of Diddie, also known as Paf Daddy, Paffi and Pi Diddie.
In his colleague, Repper Snup Doga was certainly the name of Snup Lion, and as another example, it was possible to bring up an executive, recently founded legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist known as Prince.
Attempting to commit murder on the grounds of shame in Belfast's restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife injuries on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballihakamore, as reported in the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the State Prosecutor.
Kit Harington's "Store Games" star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in the violent mid-term fantasizing of the HBO "Store Games".
However, a 31-year-old actor recently strongly criticised the stereotype of hero-macho, saying that such individuals are often encouraging young people to think that to honor you, it must be unprejudiced.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he thought something was wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the "Hungary Games" film, admitted that he was "too uneven" to this issue.
“I personally take this question seriously enough – where did we fail with the courage?” asks the actor.
"Why do we teach grown children that we have such a problem today?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for this surge of toxic courage because of too many muscle personnel.
The actor continues: “What is born and what is acquired?
What is it like to learn on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question of how can we change this?
Because today with young people, it's really not.
In the interview he also recognized that he would not participate in any rounds or rounds after the series ended next year, stating that he had “endured with Battalion and Evil”.
Since November, Kit has played a key role in the re-drawing “True West” by Sam Shepard, who tells about the film producer and his brother, the kidnapper.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting with Rose’s wife was the best final for him.
“ I met my wife on this series, so he gave me my family and my future, ” says the actor.
Rose played the Igrist, an object of the passion of China’s character, John Snow in a fancy series, awarded Emmy a prize.
The couple observed a wedding in June 2018 in the family area of Lesley in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people suffer from these diseases in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases of disease were sexually transmitted, as evidenced by changes in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the flow of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been practically zeroed by Chinese health representatives at the conference in the province of Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT was still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men with sexual contact with men end up marrying women due to the conservative values of the country.
In many cases the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxin Walters is investigating information about the escape of the Republican Party's senators, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “Turkey theories”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected the charge on Saturday that one of her staff had circulated personal information to three United States senators on the pages of the Wikipedia legislators.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that searches have been distributed by ultra-right experts and websites.
“ Lies, lies and more lies, ” says Walters on his Twitter.
It is reported that the information published includes addresses and phone numbers of United States senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Uta.
This information was posted on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capital Holme during the hearings of the Senate Commission on sexual harassment against a candidate in the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
A runaway took place some time after three senators interviewed Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of communications was linked to the Waters office and published information on the Waters staff, reports Hill.
“ This unreasonably false claim is absolutely false, ” says Walters.
“A member of my staff whose personality, personal information and security have been compromised by these munitions has not in any way been responsible for the escape of this information.
This is an unreasonably false claim.”
The Waters statement immediately called for criticism on the Internet, including by former press secretary of the White House of Ari Fleycher.
“ It’s a rejection of anger, ” Fleisher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperature that is not suitable for work at Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why don't you?
And there's no need to be justified.
And it's not supposed to fall into the motives of the prosecutors.
You must remain calm and cool.”
Fleisher, it was said, compared Walters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Cavano, whose criticisms accused him of being too mean during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who voted at Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“ If that’s true, it’s very important, ” he writes.
In his statement, Walters writes that its office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these munitions.
“We are concerned that the criminals will be found,” she wrote, “and that they will be responsible for all their actions, which may be disastrous and dangerous for all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny Inglesch is struck again — a weak - footed spy by Rowen Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain is characterised by it or otherwise; this is also true of the new traditional Spanish French agent Johnny Inglesch, which was produced in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny Inglesch: Recharge.
Is the self-emotive picture with the motto, "Of course we're all free" a new national export attempt?
In any case, Professor Johnny Inglesch, with a retired person, had his right to chaos for the second time — his name clearly meant that he was a broad-screen commercial creation designed for non-English cinematographic audiences.
Hero, of course, was a top secret agent who, despite his wonderful claims for gllamorous harmony, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bina's painting and his brother-in-law, a unique note in the Chariots of Fire in London 2012 at the Olympic opening ceremony.
This person was originally created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the author of the “International” Atkinson, who once played in the memory of Barclaycard television commercial, where the hero left behind a full chaos.
In this latest issue, JE has one or two nice moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny Inglesch approached the helicopter, walked in the middle of the day, and the wrecks were lying on his back.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson's contribution to the physical performance of comedian scenes, but the hero himself seems quite weak and extremely superior, especially since such “serious” films as Agent 007” and “Mission of non-executive” are now confidently offering a comedy as an element.
Such a feeling that the noise is related to children, not adults, and to me, the wonderful crimes of Johnny Inglesh are not as dramatic and appropriate as those of Atkinson in Mr. Ben's films.
The Permanent Mission is now committed to the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker entered the top secret British network, discovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of Agent Kevin Eldonou here, unfortunately, has had an epidemiological role.
This is the last cap for the Prime Minister, who has written and posted a picture that has already suffered from massive political instability: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for Quasi Terezi-May personnel, but in the script he has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence advisers informed her that, since each active spy had been compromised, she had to remove someone from her home.
And here on the stage is the undisclosed Johnny Inglesh himself, who is now working as a school teacher at some point in a firm, but also gives informal lessons about secret business: there are several good jokes here, as England offers the Spanish Academy skills in "the year".
England returns to Whitehall for extra instruction and joins her former unskilled friend Buff, who is also playing Ben Miller.
Baf is now a married man under the command of a submarine — the role of the “good hockey clovers ” in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes they made in her secret service, and they meet with the beautiful year-old Office of the Boulevard in the performance of Olgi Kurilenko.
At the time, the Prime Minister was in danger of falling under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire, who claimed that British computer problems could be solved by the violent Jason Walt, who played by Jack Leesy.
The English and Baf are starting to wear fur hats: masked under officers, they are building a French restaurant; they create chaos, they are transporting themselves into the Volta farm; England is producing a common anarchy, trying to use a virtual reality guarantee to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are nice and boring, but there's something very childish about them.
A lot of weighted things.
And like with other films, Johnny Inglesh, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowen Atkinson a really balanced role?
The Liberians refuse to develop a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for five-day pay.
The Leiborist Party of Jeremy Corbin is planning to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but payment will be made in five days.
The party is reported to want corporate leaders to provide additional output to the conservation workers as a result of the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence.
This would allow staff to enjoy three-day leave for the same pay.
The sources reported that the idea of “recorded” in the economic agenda of the party and would help the people of the country become part of the workforce.
The Congress of trade unions approved a four-day work week shift so that workers can benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
The High Source of the Liberian Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that the policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“It will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the approach of the party to change the balance of the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Liberian Party is not the first to support this idea because the Green Party has promised four-day work week still during its pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this effort is not currently approved by the majority of the Liberian party.
The representative of the Liberian Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party”.
Tenth Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of lesbians last week to concreteize his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to give power to the “individual directors” and “speculants” of the municipal companies.
The Tennis Chancellor's plans also mean that current Vatican shareholders may not have all their share back, as the Government of Liberia can “count” on the basis of the alleged crimes.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the Board of Directors of Companies and to establish funds including Ownership Funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of the capital to the private sector, which will be able to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking "60 minutes", could the FBI's investigation on Cavano change their opinion?
The FBR's investigation of charges to Judge Bretta Cavano held a final vote on his appointment as a top judge at least once a week and asked whether the Agency's findings could encourage any of the senators to support Cavano.
In an interview presented in the resurrection, the “60-minute” correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grema if the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"To the end," said Kennedy.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I had spoken to Judge Cavano.
So I called him after this happened, and he picked up the information, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unique.’
But Greme's opinion in voting remained undisputed.
“I have firmly defined Bret Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by action comparable to dynamics,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett strongly rejected all of this," said Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
That story is 36 years old.
And I have not seen in it any new thing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held — an annual musical event involving an impressive star with at least an impressive mission — the end of poverty all over the world.
For the seventh year of the World's Citizens' Festival, tens of thousands of people have been meeting in the main courtyard of the Central Park, but not only in order to accommodate statements by such executives as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also in order to talk about this objective: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World's Citizens' Festival, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, which is being conducted by the International Group of Human Rights Defenders to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must have participated in volunteer activities or sent an e-mail to the world's leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other important actions aimed at helping to raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free tour of the concert now to convince citizens to call for action, or is this just another case of what is called "clivism", when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or by sending messages to Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded at the festival since 2011.
It is recalled that, thanks to these actions, world leaders promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which would have to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group heard 390 commitments and declarations made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
According to the assessment of the group, the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementing experts committed to “help children fully to discover their potential”, promised Rwanda to provide $35 million in order to help put an end to the lack of housing in the area, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Cities, as you are, we can make social injustice on the lack of food in the past history,” said the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman at a live concert in London, held in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end the worst poverty?"
Global citizens respond: “This will be the long and difficult way in which we will be able to relax and fall from time to time.
But as in the great struggle against civil rights and apartheid, we succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wakeend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Moné are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York and its leaders will be Deborah Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States dollars may use the military fleet to block the export of Russian energy: Minister of the Interior
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could, if necessary, flee to its military fleet to prevent the fall of Russian energy users on the market, including in the Middle East.
Zinca claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a proposal for a study of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the officer, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the open sea routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke referred to participants in the activities organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group, which represents itself as “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually equal.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and fuel exchange,” said the Minister, calling Russia “one-third of its cost”, an economy that depends on the fuel generated.
Statements were made as a result of the Authority's task of increasing exports of its frozen natural gas into Europe, replacing Russia with a much more efficient option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Department of Trapa, including US President Donald Trapa, are trying to convince Germany to leave the “unplaceable” pipeline project “North Stream-2” which, according to Trapa, made Berlin “Plennic” Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project cost 11 billion dollars, which should double the existing transit capacity of pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that the severe opposition of Washington to this project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of uncognizable competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure instrument and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, following a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States had led to a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry in the face of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) called on the United States to remain far away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State is involved in our energy supply, this creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angel Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusets Elizabeth Warren will study the possibility of balloting the president's post in 2020
The Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that it would be possible to study the possibility of balloting in the presidential post after the interim elections.
At a city speech meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of taking part in a pre-election race.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and "start" our broken government, and for this, a woman needs to "up"," says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November I will carefully consider the possibility of balloting the President.”
Warren thus assessed the activities of President Donald Trampa at the meeting: "This area is in the wrong direction".
“I am concerned about the fact that Donald Trump is working with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open criticism of both the Trapa and his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge Bret Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: "We need to do an FBI investigation before we start voting".
However, the fourth survey showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be balsified in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Safffolk/Boston Globe, 85 per cent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be balsified.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The question showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent objected.
Other well-known names of democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byeden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Pailin spoke of the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traka Pailina at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trapa
Trek Pillin, 26 years old, served in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experience that members of other families have experienced the effects of PTSD and injuries, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peilin called his arrest "Belm on his face" and said of his son and other veterans in the war: "They are already returning to other people who have been killed, asking questions, whether they have the same respect for their friends, soldiers, planes and any other military they have shown to their country."
The train was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women involved in the situation of violence and the stockpiling of weapons in alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennet, representative of the police department of Vasil.
18 States in Colombia support the challenges of a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the region of Colombia support the legal dispute of a new US policy that prohibits the provision of asylum-seekers or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and the district of Washington submitted on Friday an analytical note by the court consultant on support for asylum-seekers in conflicting policies.
The full name of the Seeker for Grace against Sessions, issued by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not declared.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons belonging to a criminal group” had been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from States supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are making a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-promoting policy rejected the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without domestic violence documents to make a declaration of asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin stated that the new policy " ignores the decades of application of public, federal and international law".
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the search, and this prohibition violates this principle,” said the court consultant.
Lawyers also claim that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the United States are detrimental to the economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour force”.
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims of domestic or gang violence.
“Relief will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political belief,” Sachns said in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people in the world face every day.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of victims doubled in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly difficult.
“It’s very difficult right now, ” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little girl in the city’s destruction center of Paula.
“Every minute soon the aid will bring the wounded.
Clean water in large deficits."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, dig in soft things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and 7.5 patients were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had a speech impediment and a seizure, had been taken to the entrance of Paula's military hospital, where patients had been treated in open air because they had been forced to leave the room because of the continued high noise.
He wept, remembering how a violent earthquake destroyed the number in the hospital on the fifth floor that he had taken with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for saving.
I think I was impressed by the wall walls, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope that they will be saved and now they are all right."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out by “propagandist advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published in a daily American publication ad on four pages relating to the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to disseminate propaganda.
In the past, US President Donald Trump referred to the payment supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper issue of the state of Iowa, with accusations against China trying to join the US Congress on 6 November.
The claim of Trapa that Beijing is trying to get involved in the US election is a confirmation of the fact that US officials informed Reuters that a new phase was taking place in the growing Washington pressure campaign in China.
While it is common for foreign Governments to place advertising for trade promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in the process of easing trade war, resulting in a comparison of import tariffs for their countries.
China ' s duty at the beginning of the trade war was to defeat exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trapa, declared Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, the major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has caused harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this burden by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press. ”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China is using our heart with the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and placing advertising in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“So here in the newscasts, on the streets of Beijing, do you really hear the shocking voices and do not see the real differences of opinion that China could have experienced on the issue of economic policy, since local media are under the harsh control of China's Communist Party”, he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers "floced" from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not give a precise name for the issue.
Analytics warn: the Republican Republicans, by contrast, refraining from women electoral delays during the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and protect the candidate of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction here, especially by women, which may affect the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation had spread to the very end, and most Republicans had officially stated that they wanted to continue voting.
I can’t go back to such things, ” writes Grant Reyer, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier is convinced that the attempt by Senator Jeff Flicka (R-Arisona) to conduct a FBI investigation carried out in the last minute will be sufficient to calm the frustrated voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it either tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre on Friday, the senior adviser and the national representative of the rebel group MoveOn, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scandalized "November forward" against the Senate, when the Republicans, who controlled the Judicial Committee, decided to withdraw the candidacy of Cavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaissie Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the framework," said unparticipated politician Stu Rothenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already gone strong enough, and that is true.
But it can become worse, especially in the case of female voters in the camps and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before the Forum had publicly testified against the candidate for the position of the Supreme Judge, accused him of sexual harassment, analysts had assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the motion, this could lead to a responsible response.
“It is already an irregularity for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, former president of the National Committee of the Republican in the beginning of last week, as reported by NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Cavano is on the ground of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with it,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have split up a few of them on whom they still believe — Ford or Cavano — and hear more of it on the other side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe exactly or almost entirely in Forda, while 35 per cent said they believe in Cavano exactly or not.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh has been paid at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent have said the same about the Forum.
The FBI continues to investigate the allegations made by the Forum, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deboro Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed to the Senate Legal Committee that Cavano, in a state of detention, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that a candidate for the position of the Supreme Judge showed her his genitalia at the time of school at Jelles University in the 1980s.
World Cup manufacturer plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, founder of the World Cup, launched a launch that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Inrupt technology legend is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Le claimed that Inrupt was committed to the "world government".
"We have to do this now," he says about his start.
"It's a historic moment."
The Annex uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “digital online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools for data processing.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any information required.
The company calls this principle “a number of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to John Bruce, Director General, Inrupt concluded that the company provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lie, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several state developers with whom a project contract was concluded and a community of volunteers programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lie said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google on whether his companies should make any cardiac changes which would result in the total change in all their business models.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post on the Media, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “Mission Inrupt — to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lie translated the Internet into the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, the voice of Berners-Lie has been quite influential in the debate on neutrality in the network.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners Lee.
Bernard Vann: Church servant rewarded by the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one war priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, which was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellengles and Leucur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days ago, so he never knew he had a higher British military reward.
The memorial in respect of this event was very open, presented on Saturday by his two grandsons at the parade in Rushden, North Hamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was “a symbolic eye, ” which was opened some 100 years after his grandfather received a reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Canteen Canton channel “in a very harsh and powerful fire of field weapons and ammunition”.
Later, he flew on the fireline and with “the greatest blow” he pushed the group forward, and then one hand fired a field gun and pulled down three troops.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Uncle Michael Van said that “he would probably be able to do the same thing, but that would calm him down.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put on a vendetta at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brandwood.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great privilege to participate in the conference” and added that “the well-being of the real hero is confirmed by the support that many people will receive.”
The MMA volunteers didn't sleep all night looking at Bellator 206, but instead they showed them the Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you haven't seen the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six major programme battles, which were broadcast all night in the immediate ephemeral on 5 British television channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British patients were schelemolymized to see the "Swink Peppa" screen.
Some patients were not impressed by this because they did not sleep until tomorrow just to see the fight.
One of the worshippers in Twitter called this a change of mind on a child’s multifilm “a painful joke”.
“The state decision that the content was inappropriate for 6 hours this morning, so they had to turn to child programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellator on marketing and communications when asked why this happened.
"Yes, "Swink Poppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they were planning to draw up a schedule so that in the future they could also look at British spectators.
“As far as the re-examination is concerned, I think we can solve this issue,” Koker says.
“But there is a resurrection, six o’clock in the morning, and we cannot resolve this before the resurrection of our time, and it will be already Monday for them.
But we're doing our best.
Believe me, when the message has been changed, the dog of text messages has been broken and all of them have been far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, thinking it was a technical problem.
It seemed no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise it won't happen exactly the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase this number, but we're getting over it.
Indeed, it is an evil thing."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a feeling of inadequacy because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Duke Tom Daily says he's grown up feeling better because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he did not understand that “not all like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, said Lauren Lavern said he was referring to the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also said that the victory in Olympia had become less concerned after he became a child.
A regular multi-year show by Kirsty Young took a few months off due to the disease.
Daily, speaking as the main guest in Laverna's programme, said that he felt “better than any of the speakers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable for society as well as for both boys and girls.
He says: "These feelings of worthlessness and discomfort have been realized to this day, but they have strengthened me, and I have been able to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally know about his sexual orientation.
Two-time Olympic medalist was a well-known LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Society's Games in Australia, urged countries to discriminate against homosexuality in this year.
He said that he expressed his opinion because it led him to live an open life without any consequences and wanted to give others another “hope. ”
Three times the World Championship said that the feelings of a man, US director Dustin Lanso Black, whom he met in 2013, had “remained. ”
In the past year, Dale married at the Oskar Valley, which is 20 years old, but he claims that the difference in age has never been a problem.
“If everything happens in your life at such a young age, ” he went to his first 14 - year - old Olympic and his father died three years ago from cancer, “it is hard to find a relative who would have the same hearty opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Dale said that “all his world friendship” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win the gold medal," says the sportsman.
“But you know that there are more and more gold medals of Olympic medals.
He is my Lord, the gold medallion of the Olympics."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale explained that his father did not want to rest on what he died, and one of his last requests was the tickets for the first time at the London 2012 event.
“ I couldn’t tell him, ‘ Dad, then you won’t be a row anymore, and you won’t be able to sit there for the first time,’ says Daily.
“ I held him in my hand when he stopped drinking, and only when he actually stopped drinking, I finally realized that he was not victorious, ” says the sportsman.
The following year Dali participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“ I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — going to the top of the Olympic Games, it wasn’t a good feeling, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him to prepare for the Olympics and still enjoy it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, resurrection, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, who's not in shape, spent this Saturday with Kubka Ryder on the stairs.
American Phil Mikelson will set up a record in the resurrection, playing his 47th fighter, Kubka Ryder, but he will have to step up his form to avoid unpleasant ages.
Mikelson, who played on the stage on the 12th record, was sent by Captain Jim Fürich to the castle on Saturday for four and four dogs.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game in the field in hopes of correcting what he was worried about.
He never had the most direct hit, even on his career as a 48-year-old sportsman, he was not an ideal candidate for the fierce Le Golf National race, where the long race usually punished for indirect attacks.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michaelson will meet in the ninth game in the resurrection with the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who joined the new Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four eyes in 12 single matches make a sharp start, Mikalson's match may be a decisive one.
Felix expressed confidence in his partner, even though he could still say.
“He fully understood the role he had on him today, grabbed me by my back, woke me up and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Frederick.
"He's pretty confident in himself.
He's going to the Hall of Glory, and he's been doing so much for these teams and last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all of them."
In the resurrection of Michaelson, the record of Nick Faldo's match in Kubke Ryder.
This may mark the end of the career in Kubke Ryder, which has never met the heights of its individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 injuries and seven nothings, although he said that his presence had brought little benefit to the team.
“He’s a funny, sadistic, stubborn person who likes to impress people, and he’s a great guy who’s interested in you,” he explained.
“I think young people had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bourne, captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership can easily turn into an unpleasant side.
In May 1997, Datchanin detoured in Walderrama, where the team headed by Northern Ballesteros was privileged in five watches over the Americans, but only to hear and hear before the smallest difference, won with the account of 1411⁄2-131/2.
“You will continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we had won, and in Walderram where we had won, but only until now,” said Bourne, printed on the photo following the review of the 2018 class, won in the Le Golf National field on Friday and on Friday and yesterday, as a result of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You'll be in full tomorrow.
Go and do the right thing.
Until there are no eyes on the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophies, and that is what we need to focus on.
I didn't mean to focus on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well what we stand against – against the great games of the world.”
“ I would never take it for granted, ” adds Bourne.
We'll have another test tomorrow.
Individual statements are being made tomorrow, and that is quite another case.
It's always nice to be together with a partner when things go well, but when you stay alone, you're trying all your strengths from a professional golfer.
That is exactly what it takes to move the players to complete tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also apply all his efforts.”
Unlike Bourne, his opponent, Jim Fairick, believes that his individual game will be better than his partners, except Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas, who have taken three of the four eyes.
In the last few days, it has been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before Europe's "Water in Medina" was finally lost.
“I remember every short word about it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, completed his games before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would rather finish it than in Brooklyn, like in Medin.
When the initiative is moving on one side, it has a great impact on the middle of the match.
We have designed our plan for the game and designed the child as we thought it was the right thing to do, and tomorrow we are trying to create a miracle."
Tomasu was committed to attempting to lead the opposition by meeting Rory Makillro in a match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramo, Tommy Flitwood and Ayyan Polter, as well as other European games from the top of the tournament table.
"I have chosen this group of guys, and in this way, because I think they're going to cover all possible shortcomings," Bourne said, commenting on their choice of individual games.
The introduction of a new German military ship has been postponed
The new German fleet must have been launched in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen at least in the following year because of the unjust systems and the low cost growth, local media reported.
The introduction of the Reinland-Pfaltz operation, the main ship, made up of new bands of Baden-Wurttemberg class, now suspended until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The court had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery made it difficult for an ambitious project to be tried.
The four Baden-Wurtermberg ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old brakes of the Bremen class.
As they are known, they will have a powerful rifle, a lot of Zent and Anti-Squad rockets, as well as some Stels technologies, such as reduced radio, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer periods of service — it should be possible to open up new brakes for up to two years from home ports.
However, the permanent decommissioning of entry into operation means that the most modern warships, which, as they say, allow Germany to extend its power abroad, are already ageing by the time they arrive at arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 F125 fleet fell under news headlines last year when the German Navy fleet officially refused to enter the operation of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss warship in Hamburg.
This happened first when the fleet returned to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of critical “programme and equipment defects” that made the warship useless in the use of combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, since Baden-Wurtermberg's court will operate by some 120 seamen — only half of the working force on old Bremen's frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting its ability to implement future updates to the IMF.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonn Reynland-Pfaltz is twice as difficult as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect equipment, the value of the whole project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping on the new flagships are particularly important in the light of recent warning of Germany ' s reduction of military-naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the military and maritime forces were actually “suspending on the stock of ships capable of deploying”.
The officer said that the problem had been resolved over time because the old ships had been removed from operation, but their ships had not been replaced.
He visited that none of the band members of Baden-Wurtermberg class were so unable to take up the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Birds
A new study carried out in one of Scotland's boroughs has the task of showing how flies use landchaft in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received will re-examine the behaviour of unique winged lactating mammals and help in further conservation activities.
A study organized by the National Fund of Scotland will study traditional soprano, soprano, soprano, and useful long-term flies and Dobanton Nights of Inverwe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established at some point around the place to monitor the actions of flying flies throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile space surveys using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls as well as the types of activities that different groups of these animals are responsible for.
Then a residence map will be drawn up and a report will be prepared to establish a detailed picture of their conduct on the ground.
Rob Dwar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for birds and how they are used in each species.
This information will help determine the main areas of work on the management of habitats, such as the formation of lakes, as well as ways to maintain forest masses, optimal for flying flies and other related species.
The populations of flying flies in Scotland and throughout Britain have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of disappearance due to construction and development activities that affect their habitat and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may be dangerous as well as a washing machine for molluscs, chemical processing of building materials and cleaning of household shells.
In fact, flies are not blind.
However, their nightly shelters are usually such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex eho-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, which regularly conduct surveys, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only reserve flights in Scotland instead of Treve in Dhamfris and Galloue, where there are eight of the ten species of Scottish flyers.
David Thompson, who manages mobility, says that property is an ideal territory for them.
“ Here in Thrave, a great place for flying flies, ” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of good housing.
But many birds remain unknown, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for their well-being.”
It reminds us of the importance of checking the presence of flies prior to technical service within private authorities, as the unintended destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 individuals and young persons, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, destruction, injury or destruction of their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's treasure fund officer, calls on the public to help.
She says, "He has much more to learn about our birds than we know. We do not know how many different kinds of creatures there are."
Ronald refused to be charged with rape and his lawyers were going to court in the German magazine
Cristian Ronald rejected the charges against him for rape, calling them “female news” and claiming that people simply “want to make good” using his name.
His lawyers are going to file a case against footballist in the German newspaper Spigel.
Forvard Portugualia and Yuventus were charged with rape by the US on behalf of Catherine Mayorga, who took place in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday “Spigel”.
In an Instagram video with 142 million signatures, a few hours after reporting the charges, Ronaldo referred to this information as “female news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told us today is all the fictional news, says the five-time winner Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to make up their minds using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, my name will be changed, but it's just part of their work.
I am a happy person, and everything is great for me. ”
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to appear before the Court of Spigel on charges they have referred to as “unauthorized information on confidentiality concerns”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Chertz stated that the game is intended to require compensation for “the moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of a legal violation which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga both returned to the playroom, where he reportedly raped her in an anal form, according to the documents submitted by the Clarca District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good boy, but he was one per cent injured”.
The documents state that Ronalda confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she had been contacted by the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her trauma but later agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “trembling at her” and feared“ public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence as she continued to experience the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, but this year he moved to the Italian giant Yuves for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "appropriates of Car Manufacturers Who Have Always Lost"
Minister for Business and Enterprise Greg Clark said that Britain would “always regret it” if after Brexit lost his status as world leader in the production of cars.
He also commented that Toyota UK reported BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without trade, it would temporarily stop its production in Bernaston, not far from Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of trade in Brexit could result in loss of jobs.
A factory in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avenis and released nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, the production at our plant will be stopped," says Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed fears about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are the fact that, according to car manufacturers, in the absence of Brexit supply chains, there will be a high risk.
Toyota's production line is running "on time", and details for vehicles prepared for order are provided by United Kingdom suppliers and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without trade, there may be disputes at the border which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and insecurity.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks in its factory in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Terez May plan, which was heard in the Czechs, on future relations with the EU "was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement, which will allow me to repeat, not only to achieve success now but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not explain how long the production would be resumed, but in a longer term it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would ultimately lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and was the head of the trade union, says that the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government says: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, according to information from the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Trampa with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rod Rosenstein may be “transferped next week” as Bret Cavano's application for office of the Supreme Judge continues, White House said in the wake.
Rosenstein is in charge of the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the link between the Assistants of Trapa and Russia and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If the Deputy Prosecutor-General's Staff Force were to be removed from office, thus endangering Muller's independence, there was a mass of incidents in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the opportunity to record talks with Trump and the opportunity of the President ' s impotence with the help of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein is looking at this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House as soon as he could to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tripp said he "would not " prefer not" to disarm Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid contact with the Senate judicial committee, where Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Cristina Blaissie Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Tramp was scheduled to conduct a weekly investigation into the complaints of the FBI in Cavanaugh, which further held a full vote in Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News in the resurrection.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “This meeting is not yet scheduled, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events of the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press in the course."
Some journalists argue that Sanders did not make briefings at the White House on 10 September.
Leader Chris Walles was wondering why.
Sanders says that the absence of briefings has not been caused by the “pressure to the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing on the public.”
It proposed an increase in direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President is holding more meetings in response to the questions of journalists than any other president before him”, she added, but not with the exact figures: “We have these figures”.
Sanders was convinced that briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than talking to me".
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a decent replacement for press briefings."
Trap regularly answers questions from the White House by attending open meetings or press conferences with seniors.
The conference is generally very rare for the press.
It is a matter of why the President's extraordinary conduct before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be a matter of concern.
The Minister of Health is calling on EU workers in Scotland with a letter on threats from Brexit
The Minister of Health has called on EU staff working in the Scottish GSP to express appreciation for the country ' s ownership and to wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to staff less than six months before the end of Britain from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already made an obligation to cover the value of making statements on the status of EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer of negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit, and this conclusion should be made as expected.
However, the Government of Great Britain is also working towards a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very time of concern for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU and beyond will contribute valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercrombie transferred an external head trauma operation
Michael Organ from Tennessee reported that the Tennissie State Tigers, the protector, Christian Abercrombie, transferred an extra operation to the head trauma on Saturday following the defeat of 31-27 Wanderbilt Commodores.
The principal trainer of the state of Tennessee, Rod Ridd, told journalists that the trauma was received shortly before the interruption.
"He went up to the side line and just moved there," said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the back and carrying it on medical examinations.
The official representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no details about the type/level of trauma”, and in Tennessee they are trying to explain when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombie, only in the second grade, it was the first season in Tennessee City after the transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the event, he successfully caught up with five cats, which amounted to 18 cats per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher Erbic collection when they buy real estate in Great Britain.
According to the new Tori plans, there will be higher Ergonomics in the UK and additional funds will be used for homeless assistance.
This step leads to no results from Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
A higher group of Serbs will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The value is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will have a higher Erbian collection on the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people, announced today by Teresa May.
This step has resulted in Corbin's attempt to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more accessible and increase citizens' income.
The increase in the harvest will be taken from natural persons and non-taxable companies in Great Britain, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate Government efforts to help homeless people.
The contribution to the existing herb collection, including the increase of two years ago to the acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The value is expected to allow this step to generate up to 120 million sterling pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London real estate facilities are purchased by non-British people, which makes it difficult for first-time buyers to improve their housing conditions later on.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “city-of-views” because of a large number of foreign buyers who have bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the Serbian congregation to help increase the number of young people to acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of the price of real estate acquired but did not use them, and called upon Ms. May to withdraw from the quota for available housing in order to correct the “advisory situation with housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced several of the proposed positive housing reforms that would include the control of rental payments and the termination of unreasonably abandoned settlements.
He would also like to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “In the past year I have said that I have dedicated my life to meeting the British dream — to make life better with every new generation.
And that includes solving problems on our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that, for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of mobility is as accessible to British workers as it is.
For too many people, the dream of getting their own house has become too far, and for some it is too real.
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage Scotland"
The boss of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become a certain stage of the management of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish has the satisfaction of re-establishment of the North-East Club, which is currently a third place in the first league, separated from the first three eyes.
This year he moved to the Stadium of Light after he returned to St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a game.
I got the B key, and everything," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching my father for Scotland in Hampden as a child, and that always attracted me back.
However, this option will only occur if I can become the successful director of the club.”
The presidents of Rossa, the manager of Sunderland were also Dicka Advocacy, David Moises, Sam Godardas, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says he did not try the stairs before such official names in such large clubs as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club will undoubtedly belong to the Prime Minister,” says the trainer.
“Bring it up there is not a simple task, but I'll think it's done with my task only if I can get back to the club.”
Ross has been working for three years at the manager's office, starting with the assistant manager in Dumbarton, and then spending 15 months at the Hearts Training Station.
He then helped Alla to get up from the third level, and in the following season St. Mirren withdrew from the lower positions of the champion.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“Probably this was this cross,” he recalls his work in Alla.
"I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate to me than the game.
That sounds weird because I've done everything well, I've worked very well at this job, and I've achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good about the manager's position.
I always wanted to guide, and now I feel the most comfortable fish in the water for my adult life.”

The summer summer saw the increase in the sale of British popes but reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, says: “The continued solar activity, as well as the longer than expected, of England's participation in the World Championship, means that July continued its trend last month, June, when the tobacco sales increased by 2.8 per cent and in restaurants, however, significantly decreased. ”
Youth income fell by 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade also continued in July.
Babes and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results than in restaurants.
Babes selling only food also suffered from sunburn, although not as strong as restaurants.
It is a feeling that people want to jump out of the street just to miss a sticker.
Sales of drinks in potatoes and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent.’
Paul Neuman, RSM analyst in the field of long-term and hospitality business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we observe since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sport activities remain key factors when it comes to market sales.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to experience difficulties, since the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful because of the continued price pressure.
A long summer of hot summers seemed never to happen to airborne operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, would be so much adhesion.”
The total increase in sales of potatoes and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of branding.
The monitoring of industrial sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the productivity of 47 networks with total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds of Sterling and is a recognised industrial ethanol.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he or she is hiding from parents.
According to the survey, every fifth child, some 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social networks that he or she hides from parents and teachers.
About 20,000 high school students have found the growth of the page “Fequeinsters”
This news has raised concerns about the content of sex
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a “main” account that parents knew about
However, every fifth child, some 11 years of age or older, creates accounts in the accounts that he or she is hiding from adults.
About 20,000 high school students have found a rapid increase in the number of physical “institution” accounts, i.e. the Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news has raised fears about the publications of the content of sex.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a “clean” account on which their parents had access, but there were still secret accounts.
One mother, who eventually had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, approached a teenager who called on others to “strengthen him”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awakenings UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles in sets, with half of them recognized as usually secret.
Chapter HMC Mike Bukenen says: “Many adolescents are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and that is a disturbing fact.”
Elid Doyle becomes the “voice of athletes” of the Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, the most famous athlete in Scotland for easy athletics, says President Yen Bitty, is an excellent opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of sportsmen at the international level over the past decade.
“Elid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Lightball community, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefits to Scotland,” says Bitty.
Doyle says: "I am looking forward to becoming a sportsman's voice, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta had four gold medals and now works as a series of commentators on BBC and lost the ability to walk after the transfer of the insulin.
He writes in his Twitter: “I had a stroke last month.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it's only time to show if I'm gonna fix it, and if so, how much.
It was a horrible job, but I was completely healed, and I've learned to walk again and I'm doing hunting today!
Thank you so much for your support!"
An ad of milk yolks in which breast-feeding mothers were compared to cows, shared user views on the Internet
The dairy production company has raised disputes over the Internet and has published an ad where breast-feeding mothers are compared to rabbits.
On the market, Elvie published a commercial music video demonstrating the freedom that the new babydotoss provides to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in the back of the choir under a musical track, where they say, "Yes, I'm cooking my own milk, but you won't see me with my chest" and "If you didn't notice it, it's not me, it's my breast."
And the people said, “We are going to reach it, and we are going to feed our young people with milk, and we are going to reach it.”
This advertising role, published on the Facebook page, led to online discussions.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a variety of reactions from viewers, and many say it brings light to the “fire” of the dairy industry.
“It is a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be taken and born to produce milk, except that their children take them for a few days after birth, ” writes one user.
Elvie is dressed directly under a special bus (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: “It is understood that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise ice cream for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds: “Adverted from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, protected their role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great”.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed a kid, I'd be obliged to buy it.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is, of course, a little tired, but it feels like it.
A generic product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "Protocol Ad, which is due to the mother who breast-feeds (particularly they do it directly in their workplaces or toilets), and who, in fact, feel a little "crowds".
This is not to glorify or pray our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undisclosed milk sauced under the bustle.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milk is totally unconscious, there are no pipes or pipes, and it is free to be in a drill case for cooking, and it is inevitable that women are allowed to move, keep small children and even go out on the street during pregnancy.
Anna Balarin, a partner and early development specialist for Mother’s children, comments: “Molkotos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a strong and provocative advertising.
We wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all its problems, thereby demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom of the new baby.
This is not the first case when Elvie's milk is falling into the headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared under the direction of Martha Yakobowski’s designer, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved safely to a palace camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased rapidly, although the number of monthly cuts remained relatively stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the authorities of Trapa have made it difficult to place children in the hands of employers.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid of endangering their country ' s residence, and have taken custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential contractors and other adult members of their families would have to supply fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, senior immigration and customs officer, testified at the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of persons who had been requested to take care of the remaining minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not previously convicted.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are employers or members of their families are illegal in the country, and most of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That is why we continue to persecute these people, ” said Olbens.
According to the reception staff, in an effort to speed up the process of child training, officials introduced new rules that some of them were required to appear before the court within a month of detention, not within 60 days of the previous arrest.
In order to declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video media rather than on their own.
Those who are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
According to arresters and information from the system in recent months, more children are still in detention than are likely to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to the outbreak of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are being addressed in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties will be more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that if children are taken to court camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare for or make friends, this can prolong the trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria directs the “occupational force” of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately take out the army
In his statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had already been in war for eight years.
Muala, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegal in Syria, under the suggestion to combat terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 36 million people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war with terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territory” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed around 2000 military personnel in Syria, who are primarily training and consulting both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Barara Asada.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of“ spreading irrational fears”, which had caused refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of civilians,” he says.
“They policy what must be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war has been reached.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large amount of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a wide-ranging attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where there are three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that this agreement had “a very early date” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including those of the Al-Qaida-related fighters who “will be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened in the near future, consisting of government representatives and opposition to develop a new constitution for Syria and propose a path to elections.
Mualam presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in this committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “examination of articles of the current constitution” and warning of interference.
Why does Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Mr. Tramp will win the re-election in 2020 if the impasse and scandal do not premise its presidency, which is likely to be hoped by many liberal observers.
And this will certainly be “the most dramatic end of the entire history of the Presidency!”
At present there are no signs of transparency among viewers.
From 2014 prices increased by more than two — up to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly three times — to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has taken over cable channels by gathering 3.5 million viewers at night at the time of major news.
“This is a fire that people are suffering because it is outside our understanding,” says Nil Ber, director of the ABC drama “A designated survivor”, about a member of the cabinet of ministers who will become president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skwell, a former comedian writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant facts about the discovery of Hollywood boys” suggests another theory.
She recalls how she once rode on a bus in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, “Because he is crazy.”
In all of this there is something precious — joy.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, the lines of Washington's events can determine the future of Roo v. Weed and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and health in the world economy.
The exception is the growth that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you're ready for six hours to see how the expert group discusses the use of Bob Woodworth 'a deep background' for his book "Strech" or Paul Manaforta's short suit of $15,000 from a tight skin (adhesived clothes", according to Washington Post), or a short description of St. Daniels, says Mr. Trampa's anatomism is already out of regular awareness.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario with my eyes.
“Particularly his work to make us feel that the reality of the show is that he will feed you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars on the changing activist composition of the Trampa show and the daily turns of the ring (drake with N.F.L., reenactment of Kim Chen Ina).
You can't let yourself miss any episode or you're hopelessly gone.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat in the northern coast of Hawaii, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC during CNN's entry.
He could not get out of the screen at least not exactly when it was shown how Brett Cavano stood before the Senate Legal Committee and decided on the future Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these mixed shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Fleis.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it seemed they were right."

Autsider's money is influenced by the worst intermediation elections leading to the White House
It is no wonder that the 17th zone of Pennsylvania has received a flow of cash as a result of the change in the areas of Congress in which two officials are participating in the race for the same place.
This rural area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed recently, supports the democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lamba, which has taken place in another district at the extraordinary elections of the past spring.
Lamb speaks against another active official, the Republic of China Rotfus, who is currently represented by the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely interrupted by the new 17th.
The cards were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that, as a result of pre-election machines, the old areas were subject to constitutional violations by the Republicans.
In the new 17th district, the Honca launched a heated discussion on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCRC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after a small difference in the special elections observed in March in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Tramp has won a round of 20 prizes.
Political experts offer little advantage to democracies.
The United States of America ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing as a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp conducted a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varelay, who was also in Panama until partners visited the management team of the organization of Trapa.
The representatives of the Department decided to withdraw US Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “Recent Unrecognised Solutions in Taiwan”, said the press secretary of the Department of Hezer Nawart earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only with regard to El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed tax sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target visa restrictions, would make Central America sick to that country with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In line with the regular meetings of the representatives of North and Central America, a high-level conference on security and economic growth was held to provide the results of a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior representatives of the Administration had come to the realization that they wanted the preparation of the conference to continue and had actually ceased to consider El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference was scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens to indicate that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives kindly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further cruel messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates discussed by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues under anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the side analysis of the administration, but also spoke of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be the communication of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible suppression of justice by Mr. Trampa, with very significant evidence currently available in public records.
Mr. Muller was also reported to have been investigating the facts of the Treaty of Trapa with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress changes its position, Mr. Tramp is present before the person responsible for this body, just as he is prepared to speak again before the voters, and perhaps in the final outcome before his colleagues.
But there is a lot of "if"; I do not mean that Mr. Trampa's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We are all making a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which is about the duration of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to build a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would happen if the West were against him and supported by the Czech-Solvian army in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and this has allowed us to avoid the coming years of bloodshed.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the path of democracy is being accelerated or suspended.
The Americans are experiencing some of these moments of defeat now.
What will we do if Mr. Tramp is defeated by Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rozenstein, the man who controls Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the paper, he has proposed to make secret records of the President ' s activities last year and to discuss his incompatibility to the post.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times data are false.
“How will we react if a recent requested FBI investigation about Bretta Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is generally approved as the post of the Supreme Judge despite the credibility of the accused in sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for the Congress, which will attract Mr. Trampa to responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter is too difficult for democracy.
But I believe we can go through them properly because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-born Jew sent to the Osvencian by the same Nazi regime, which once occupied a house in which I lived many years ago.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, I was able to use subsidized candles on the table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers was optimistic in the face of a encounter with the Russian football club Rapid.
The Rangers adopted the Venetian Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after printing nothing in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take a strong position in the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented Drans from speaking first in the season before 2:2 against Villarreala, but he believed that Rangers could use this result as a trample to achieve great results.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal was a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we went out with nothing.
At the end of the day, we may have been able to handle it, but in general nothing was likely a fair result.
They probably played better in the first team, and our success came to the second team, where we're doing better.
This Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get three glasses, but this will be a tough game because they showed good results in their last game, but I'm sure, given the support of patients, we can move forward and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, taking into account all my injuries and replacements in the club itself, but there is now a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully improved, and the children are really satisfied with it; training has gone on to “war”.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the previous season and succeed."
Women lose their dream of being afraid of their pensions
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said they had discussed with their wives the value of long-term care.
However, only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want to care about them, but they don't try to discuss it with them," says Holly Snaider, Vice-President of Nationwide for Life.
And that's what we need to do.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the possibility that they will take care of you if you do not listen to your wishes.
Discuss with your consultant and your family where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in spending.
Consult with your financial adviser: he will help you to develop a plan for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-sustainment through your own property if you have money.
Carry out your legal documents: get rid of legal battalions.
Build trust in health care, and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and monitor that experts are able to meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
We also recommend that we consider the possibility of financial confidence.
You should select a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you appear inadequate.
Remember, too, that your elderly parent needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on what medicines he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write all these details in a book so that they can be prepared in any case.
Martin adds: "It is important not only to have money but also to choose a doctor."
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Build up and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic valve
A man shot several times from a pneumatic valve returning home from the game.
The victim, in the chest, life and arm of which the chicken had been burned for 40 years, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 a.m. on the English summer, as “incidence”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result of the exit of communications, rescuers cannot receive any information from Donggala, a region north of Palu, which is close to the 7.5-ball earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Donggal, located on the island of Slavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western side of the island of Slavèsi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis occurred.
Donggala is an area covering about 300 km (180 miles) of the coastal line north-west of the island of Slavesi.
In 2017 there were 299,200 people living in the administrative area of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the economy of the province, but mainly focused on Moroval, on the opposite side of Slavèsi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Reduction Agency, over the past 100 years the tsunamis have been destroyed several times in Palu and Donggal.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcano and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Akheh on the north coast of Sumatra on 26 December resulted in tsunamis that devastated 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Akheh.

The oldest son of Sari Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Pillin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaski and vice-president of President Sari Pillin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vasilia, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence in a situation where there was domestic violence and for resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police of Alaska.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up his phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su investigation facility and will be released at $500.
He appeared before the court on the Sabbath, and when they asked him whether he was guilty of his “sinful innocence.”
Pailin threatened to commit three small crimes in Class A, which meant that he could be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and sentenced to $250,000.
It was also charged with the crime of Class B, which was punishable by one-day deprivation of liberty and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case when criminal charges have been brought against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pillin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, the family violence report and the stockpiling of weapons in the context of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.

The Federal Prosecutor wishes to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York
The New York federal prosecutor was sentenced to death for Saiful Saipov, who was suspected of carrying out the case in New York, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare penalty for a federal offence that had not been applied since 1953.
In October Saipov, 30 years old, as he took home Depot's call for an attack on a six-way highway to the West Side in the Netherlands of Manhattan by passengers and passengers.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov had “premaritally” killed eight people and “premaritally” nannys, according to a report on the intention of death penalty in New York.
According to the judicial document, the death penalty may be imposed on both of these charges.
A few weeks after the attack, the major federal jurors charged Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “intensely planned and planned”, Saipov carried it out, as described as “absolutely violent and criminally”.
"Sifullo Habibullaević Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Kleves, Ann-Lora Dekata, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko," says the report.
Five lost were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the death penalty was required by the prosecutor in the South of New York for criminal offences.
In September 2009, accused Halid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty for federal cases in New York was applied in 1953 in relation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to a contract for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was executed on 19 June 1953 by a power plant.
According to the Saipov judicial documents, the Uzbek prosecutor has demonstrated the absence of an execution after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that when he was attacked, he was inspired to watch the IGIL video on the phone.
He also requested the IGIL flag to be carried out in his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denied his guilt for all 22 counts of conviction.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on the side of Saipov, said that they were “exactly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the pain of these events for all their participants,” said Patton.
Saipov's protection had previously been appealed to the prosecutors with no death penalty.
A member of the Parliament of Tori says that NAYJEL FARAZ should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraj conference, people 'mobilize the people's army.
Former Ukip leader said that policies should “feel more like” Eurosceptics, as one member of the Teresa May Parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said at a meeting in Birmingham that Britain would already have "out", if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, trying to reconcile her deeply divided lines, was further compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori Party who spoke against leaving the EU joined in a separate protest against Brexit, which was taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, which was heard in the Czechs in response to an attack by the Brexit, his opponents and the EU.
The Unions insist that it continues to try to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Libers to choose between its package and "haus".
Mr. Bown said at the meeting Leave Means Leave in Solichall that he wanted to "bet the checks".
He suggested that Mr. Faraja should be held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone up," he said.
Mr. Wellingboro added: "I will continue to speak about Brexit, but we need to play checks."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world's wars to be independent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain completely out of line with reality.”
The newspaper Brexit of the Tori Andrea Jenkins also interviewed journalists, saying: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people."
“Checkers are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also not popular among the members of our party and our activists, who actually push the streets and first select us.
Please turn away from the Czechs and start listening to what they're saying to you."
In her brief address to Mrs. May, she added: "The Prime Minister will remain in his office if he is true to his promise."
Mr. Faraj said that if policies were to give up a decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they would have to be forced to “feel it again”.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, people and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to give Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you down with this."
Turning to the repentant crowd, he added: “I want our political class on the Brexit border to feel further.
“We mobilize the people’s army of this country, which gives us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
At that time, Brexit's opponents passed a demonstration on Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists have mixed Tori v. Brexit posters in these outlets.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Leiborist Party, Lord Adonis, criticized conservators for the security problems in their mobile application.
“And these people claim that they can create Canada's IT systems and technology plus, for work on borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one of the common causes.
Good Brexit does not exist in principle,” he claims.
Warren plans to "examine the possibilities" for participation in the presidential run
A member of the United States Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after November's elections she would “extend to study the possibility of balloting in the presidential capacity”.
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about its future at the meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, part of President Donald Trampa's criticism, was fought in November for a re-election against a member of the Republican party, Jeff Dila, who was co-chaired by the Trapa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Talks are being held that she has the chance to take the post of Trapa in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since the time that Trap entered the post, it has been her 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a round-up meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to vote for the president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to "start" our broken government and that it needed to be a woman."
As a result of Simsa's murder, LSU was arrested
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that LSU Wyed Sims's basketballist, who was arrested on Friday, was suspected of murder.
At 11:00 after the English press conference, Baton-Ruj Police announced Dayton Simpson arrest, 20 years .
On Friday, the police station published a video on the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to remove the video.
The 20th year of Sims was shot around the South University campus on Friday morning.
“ Wade Sims got a gun wound in his head that ended, ” said the chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday.
Wade came in for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was involved in the incident, had his own gun and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without opposition and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
A young man grew up at 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 players in the last season and picked up on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 glasses and 2.9 games.
Gran By Russia: Luis Hamilton is approaching the title of the World Championship after his military tactic has won him over Sebastian Fettel.
From the time Walter Bottas had graduated on Saturday, it became clear that the Merdès team tactic played a major role in the race.
With half-to-half-way Bottas has already started well and practically trusted Himilton when it protected his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to the Pitt-Toehouse, leaving Hamilton in the corner of the entire group – a decision-making election.
Merdès went down one side of the track, and then went back to Fettel, but Hamilton, after some battle with the bicycle, went forward, which led to the unwillingness of Ferrari's driver to leave the inner space free, risking to sink after a double movement to protect the third route.
On his 21st day of birth, Max Ferstappen began off the back of a series of networks and was at seven to the end of the first round.
He then drove most of the race, held on his knees, in order to finish quickly, moved Kim Reikkonen to the fourth place.
As a result, he went to the Pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds as Rykkonen took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Walter had done fantastic work on the outside and had shown me this honor.
The team has done such an extraordinary job to have a couple of pieces in stock," Hamilton said.
Transmissible language of violence
President Donald Tramp criticised Senator Diane Fynstein's meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not publish Christina Blaissie Ford, accused of Bretta Cavano, a high-ranking judge, in sexual harassment.
In his statement at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony of the Forum to the Senate's Legal Committee, saying that the Senate had shown that participants in these events were “low, cold and lying people”.
“ The only possible response to all of this, and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it is anger, evil, guilt and lie, ” he said.
You see all these running away. Then they will say: 'No, I did not do this.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Fynstein, did you get the information?
Remember her answer... did you get the document information? "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't swear.
Yeah, stop.
No, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, he added to the senator's enthusiasm.
In July, Finstein was sent a letter with a detailed statement of charges against the Ford v. Cavano, and it was illegally published in early September, but Finstein refused that the escape had occurred in her office.
“ I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t get her information, ” said the Finstein Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she refused to be accused of running away seemed to be not pleasing to the president, who made this comment during a Saturday morning: “What I tell you is that the body language has given her a good reputation.
Maybe she didn't say anything, but the body language was worse than I've ever seen.
While continuing to protect his candidate from the position of a Supreme Judge who was charged with sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democracy used these charges for its own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to return their authority in all available ways.
We observe the area, the prosperity, and all that they are trying to move through to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Jaans"
Patrick Duyer killed two guys for "Jiants" in a game against "Dandy"
In the game Elite hockey league, Dandi Stares was awarded a five-day defeat against Belfast Jaans, winning a match on Saturday with a 5-3-year-old Dandy.
Janets received an early advantage in two cases due to the attacks of Patrick Duier and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Kouni raised the level of the household team before Duyer took Jaanants to the leader.
French Bush compared the account "Dandy" before two holes in Lucas Lundvald Nilsen's victory.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who won over Dandi by 2:1 at Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third victory in the season of the Elythic League.
Among the parties, this was the fourth meeting in the season when Janets won three previous matches.
The first round of Dwayer arrived at the fourth minute at 3:35 after the main pass of Kendall McFolla with the support of David Rezerford, after which Boviler doubled the advantage of four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sallivan returned the players to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markvardt used the law to balance the account at 15:16.
Doier confirmed that Janets took the initiative at the first break when he killed the second round at the end of the first period.
Hosheeva was regrouped, and Busha regrouped the account, killing the goal by a number of transfers at 27:37.
The Counnies and Charles Corcoran have joined in helping Nilessen to give Dandi the first chance to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, won a victory by holding the contestants in the middle of the field until the end of the period.

A plane inspector died because hundreds of people on board were able to escape earthquakes
The Indonesian aircraft inspector was subsequently granted the name of a hero after he deliberately went to death because hundreds of passengers had been able to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many died without news as a result of a massive earthquake on the island of Slovesi on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
Strong underground bridges continue to destroy the area, and many of the inhabitants of Paul’s city were under walls.
Although his colleagues had escaped because of their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at Muteara Cis Al Juffri, city of Palu.
He remained in his place to prove that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then located on the ground floor, was safe to land.
Then, when it was shown to him that the roof was torn apart, he turned away from it.
Later he ended up in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesia's Air Navigation Johannes Siratit said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Caliman to transport it to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dissident ended before the helicopter was able to meet in Palu.
“We are very sorry about this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims of earthquakes could reach thousands of people because, according to information provided by the Natural Disaster Reduction Agency, access to the towns of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to choose from there,” says the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six feet [6 m], left the city of Paul, where the mass destruction of the dead will take place in the resurrection.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance in the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Soon assistance will bring the victims every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross colleagues are already running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken quite serious steps, but it may be much worse.”
The Indonesian President, Joko Vidodo, came to Paul in the resurrection and said to the armed forces of the country, in particular: “I ask all of you to work day and night to meet all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared without news after a plane crash in the truck
The airline carrying out a raid on the Pacific coast of Micronesia is now reporting that one person lost news when it was said that all 47 passengers and coaches had abandoned the tonnage.
The Air Niugini report states that, as on the Saturday, she has no information about one man-sex passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police in an attempt to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, for example about his age or nationality.
Local seafarers helped save other passengers and aircraft after he landed on the water, trying to land on the island of Cuzuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The causes of aviation disasters and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and the USM claim that the aircraft landed in the cabin near the airport.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the ground floor.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane has become too low on the ground floor.
"And that's very good," adds Janice.
Janes said he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a tonnage plane, as the water level was on the ground.
He also said that the Stuartes panicked and shouted at the ship and that he had a slight headache.
The United States Army reported that mariners who had rebuilt the news of the approaching had also helped to rescue the ship they had brought to the shore before the plane was loaded some 30 metres (100 feet).
The flight safety data show that over the last two decades, airlines registered in PNG have lost 111 people, but none of them have been related to Air Niugini.
Analytics on disclosures have demonstrated the fact that women are alive
On Saturday, the case was raised against the male accused in 2014 by the inhabitants of Mississippi.
The Department of Justice analysis of the United States Paul Roulett provided long-term evidence as a witness to the analysis of the intelligence.
He told the members of the department how he used cell phone records to produce a common picture of the action of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he had received data on the location of these people on several mobile phones; according to this data, that night, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous evidence, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this situation became clear, the police asked for it.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sifford whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that that night he was in Senford's truck, Sandford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another difference was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
According to telephone records, however, they were gathered only for one week.
Roulette also indicated that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's got her out of his life," says Heil.
Protection should begin with its concluding arguments in the resurrection.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What's the "unknown hip hop"?
Three hip hoppers are going to fight the negative attitude of this generation, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group from Bristol argues that the content of hip hops has changed from a number of political and social problems.
The group would like to return to its roots and make the “unidentified” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently become witnesses of rebirth in Britain through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York's Ninja brought into court a family couple for racist purposes
New York's Ninja brought a family together for discrimination after receiving a complaint from a woman that she had been “one more black” who had been mishandled by a woman instead of her husband.
The spouses reject that they are racist, claiming that the request is given with “the purpose of demand”.
Linci Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern at the fact that the new nursery offered by the Child Care Service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came into the family on her first working day in 2016.
“NEARLY not so much as this, another black one,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in her husband’s opinion.
Instead of sending her husband’s message, however, she twice misdirected Mrs. Morris.
Realizing his plight, the "confused" Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in service that no one who had been an African did a bad job, and in general they were expecting the Philippines, not the Afro-American, reports New York Post.
Morris paid for one day's work and then sent us home to Uber.
Morris is now in court on a family basis and is demanding compensation for the release of $350 a day in six months, in accordance with the terms of a certain oral agreement which, however, were not bound by any contract.
"I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable," she said on Friday, adding, "and I know that this is discrimination."
The husband disagrees with the charge of racism and claims that the release of Morris could be considered a reasonable step because if they tried it, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her to report that she did not really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, ” said the husband, Joe Plasco, in Post.
But you would trust someone with whom you had been afflicted, even if you were to bury him?
Would you trust your newborn child?
That's good for you!"
By calling it “a cure”, Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child two months ago and had become “a difficult situation”.
“Are you willing to follow a man who has been made to suffer like this?
It's not very nice of you," added a bank worker specializing in investment.
The judicial proceedings are still ongoing, but the public opinion has already brought its judgment on social networks, accusing them of being inadmissible behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not be able to walk with the speaker, says in a new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the publication was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put herself in the place of the first person who reads the production before it was published.
It's fun to know that Paddington has great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a baby book on a bear, had worked as an operator on BBC, and would have referred to the rejection of the publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year-old jubilee of his book was “and happy and bitter” as their author had not happened last year.
With regard to Paddington's own nurse, she was called upon as “the most important member of our family”, and her father was quietly proud that his staff had finally gained knowledge.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter tells him.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of him even though he did not consider this success to be his own.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave his own due bride.”
I had to apologize to my dying daughter on the phone.
After her daughter was landed at the Nizzie Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors were trying to save her life.
"He called over regularly and said that everything was really bad that happened didn't happen," said Mrs. Ednan Laperuz.
Then he called again and said that she would die within two minutes and that we should apologize.
I did the same.
I said, "Tah, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, allowing her heart to work, gradually stopped acting, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I should've just sat down and waited, knowing everything was going to end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I've got to hold my hands firmly."
At the end of Miss Ednan Laperuz, anxious about the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, calming down with a huge loss she had just had to survive.
“ No one around knew what happened, ” she says.
"My head's gone, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survived the loss of their loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfri are located at Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis Taylor's son was 13 when he became depressed, and when he was 18 years old, he ended up with him.
“ I don’t want other parents to test what I’m trying to do every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, relates that her son was a great fighter and had a skinny scarf.
"They all loved his beauty.
They said, "When he falls down, there will be light in his room."
However, before his death he left work because he was now living in a time of fear.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler finally found his cousin, who was then 11 years old.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm not afraid of a sudden reaction."
Ms. Davis thought about these findings, "that people knew that there was someone to whom they could call and tell everything, even if it was your friend.
You can't sit down and talk to people."
Mrs. Hamfries, who has spent many years with Mrs. Davis, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with her for 15 years — not soon after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt confused, confused, or something like that,” she says.
“For a few days before birth, we noticed changes in his attitude.
It was very bad for him when he was born. He did not even look at children when they discovered their gifts.
She says his death was a major trauma for them, but they have to go through it, this incident has affected our family.
It broke her to pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Future Bretta Cavano's look at hair: FBR's starting investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — a time-limited investigation and volume, we could contribute even a little unity,” said Mr. Flick on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would "disappear" on the basis of a growing party core response.
Why did Mr. Kawano and his party-republicaries not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their confusion.
The interim elections will take place every five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, everything will go wrong for the Republicans, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush would call on the senators, with the support of Mr. Kawano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush's future wife, Ashley, who was then working as Secretary-General.
What happens after the FBI finds out its report?
A vote will take place in Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kawano would be able to get 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equal voting and confirm his candidate for the post of the Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea decreased at Kim
Since Kim Chen Inn came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined, the South Korean legislator said.
Bian Seug, referring to the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared with the 2706 escape cases recorded in 2011, this figure was reduced to 1127 last year.
Mr. Pak said that key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates taken by smugglers.
The public commentaries do not give.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the reliable protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often places pressure on them to return.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the state of war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Phanya to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of US Presidents Donald Trampa and Kim Chen Yin in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Riy Yun Ho accused the United States of hindering progress in this matter by his sanctions.
“If we do not have any less confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Rei in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie calls Bretta Cavano "ischer" and claims he is not willing to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Cawano, a candidate for the High Court ' s position "isister" and said that he was not qualified for work in the Supreme Court due to his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Ostin, Texas.
“I can’t imagine that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave in such a way, she would immediately call her a “sister”, says Pelosi about her reaction to the Cavano's presentation in the Senate Legal Committee, which they received on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Kristin Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which seemed to have occurred when they were both young.
Cavano was sufficiently emotional, even in times of crisis, and breathes, talking about his family and school years.
He also summed up the Committee's democracies, calling it "the gross and well-planned murder of an active person", organized by liberals who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavano had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a preconceived relationship with democracy.
“I think he is disqualifying himself by his claims, as well as by his reference to Clinton and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi complained when she was asked whether she was trying to get to Cavano's responsibility if his fault was confirmed and if democracy was to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so: If he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not only consent to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now,” said Pelosi.
Cavano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano regarding the Law on Access to Medical Services or the “Roo v. Weed”, since it was considered to be a representative of conservative justice.
In his candidacy, Cavano has raised the question of whether he will reject some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“It is not the time for a man who has been executed and taken to the office of the Supreme Judge to say, ‘How great!’” says Pelosi.
And women should be able to do so.
It's fair anger, months and years of light, she can't go through it without a trace.
“ When we’re wrong, we’re crying, ” said Miss Steine 45 down.
"I don't think it's so unusual anymore, what do you think?"
She said: "A woman who has worked for me in a position of oversight, and she said that she was crying when she was wrong, but she has developed a technique that she has explained to her companion: 'You may think that I am crying because I am upset.
In fact, I'm upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I am impressed by this approach."
The tears are permitted as a way out of anger, partly because they are treated unjustly in the root.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office where men dominated me: I once cried out of a terrible rage, but I understood the smell of an elderly woman, the soulless manager I was always afraid of, and I called into a wooden cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said to me.
"But they know not that thou art crying out evil.
They think you're upset, and they're glad that they've brought you the end."
Patricia Schreder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was arrested for some minor intrusion and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schreder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons for her to vote in the presidential position.
“This decision was not the right thing to think about, ” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years ago.
“Seven other candidates were already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called this case "Belsenjka and seven genomes".
The campaign had already reached its end, she had given up a lot of money, and therefore she hoped that she would not participate in the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was said that this was a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
"What am I supposed to do with them?" she wondered.
When she spoke with her voice, noting that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, as well as the anger resulting from discrimination on the grounds of sex that she was breathing.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Ms. Schreder about how the press responded to her.
"It could have been thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, "What do they write on my memory?"
"She's a thief without end?"
How a trade war with America can be useful to Beijing
Experts believe that the first wave of trade between the United States and China has been devastating, and although the battle is still far from over, the gap between countries can benefit Beijing in a long-term perspective.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year by imposing the basic Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant increase took place this week when new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually taxed half of all goods coming from the United States of China.
Beijing has each suffered an equal response attack, recently establishing shipments of US dollars of $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the response against the United States would be equal at all times, and the second on the size of the world economy would probably start to test even if the smaller difficulties were in the near future.
To keep Washington away means to make claims, but to make the United States public would be too careful for Si Zzinpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can properly play its cards, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead to economic collapse in any of these countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than those previously recognized by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist at the Center for New American Security, a new American Security Center specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria claims that it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and is seeking assistance in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In his statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulalem reported that conditions in the country had improved.
“Today’s situation on the ground has become more stable and secure as a result of the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore the devastated areas so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives are being created.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country at the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulalem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in restoring the country of destruction.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe is strengthening the victory of Kubke Ryder in Paris
The European team won Kubok Ryder 2018, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
Six United States dollars have already been lost on European land and the European Cook Ryder has not won since 1993.
Europe has returned its crown thanks to Captain Thomas Bourne's team, who has gathered 14.5 pounds needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who fought most of the tournament, made his first long shot at water on the 16th of June par-3, joined his French Molinari match.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all its rounds, became 1-x-4-games that once went 5-0-0, as the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit suffered defeat at 5:4 with the lowest rating in the European team, the Turbior Olessen from Denmark.
One of the best in the world of games, Dustin Johnson, introduced 2:1 Jan Polter from England, who probably participated in the Cooke Ryder last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Kubkov Ryder, has become the winner of a tournament throughout Europe with 25.5 eyes for career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stay today.
That was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cube again.
It's all over the team, and I'm glad I was able to help,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the case to his colleague John Ramu, who in the resurrection won the American golf league by Tiger Woods with 2:1 in a single game.
“I’m experiencing incredible pride for this victory – I’m growing up watching Tiger Woods’ game,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest games of all time, which won 14 main titles, only Jack Niklaus.
The United States of America fought all the way out, trying to win, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the top class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürich said after his team said: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning it was easy for us to get to Europe.
It didn't work out.
Let's take off our shoes in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
It's all 12 games played too high.
We are regrouping, I'll work with PGA America and our Committee on Cubca Ryder, and we'll move forward with success.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to be able to play.
We have been lost."
Beautiful flood: News The Micro-Organization Concentration in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The last report of the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Forestry reflects the overall decrease in the concentration of red-water in some parts of the Tampa region.
According to FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller, there are reports of a decline in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Sea covers about 130 miles north of the Pinall to the south of Li.
Hopes can be observed about 10 miles from the Hillsboro coast, but their number has dropped significantly over the last few weeks.
The beautiful lake is also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week an average concentration was reported in and near Pinellas, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coastal zone, high concentration in Manatati and Sarasota and coastal zones, medium concentration in Charlotte districts, high concentration on the Li coast, and low concentration in the Coler district.
In the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Coler continue to be observed as likely to break up breathing.
In the northwestern Florida, this probability was not reported last week.
