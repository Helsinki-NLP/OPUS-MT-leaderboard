New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state lawyers say they want to know more about who pays for a project worth $16 billion supported by Governor Geria Brauna after the representative of the leading California Water Supply Administration said that the Brauna administration offered government funding to complete two major water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles Metro Water Supply Management may be contrary to the State's long-term claims that various local water supply management, not California itself, would pay for the Brown vision of two identical 35-year-old tunnels to modernise the waters south of the Sacrament River, mainly Central and South-California.
The initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels of $248 million in the amount of US$248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already begun the federal audit investigation.
On the third day, state legislators also ordered a state audit of the construction of tunnels.
On the fourth day, State Spicer Nessia Vogela said that, despite the Los Angeles Metro Water Supply Management Account, no use will be made of the state’s general budget for the completion of the current planning phase of two tunnels.
However, the opposition of the tunnels and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Sūzan Ega, one of the lawmakers of the state of the audit ordered last week, asked the State for clarification on Thursday.
"It's a game with the purchases," said David Volfs, the Legal Director of the Taxpayer Association Howard Jervis.
In my opinion, this is related to the evening audit (demand): there are more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brauns and some politically influential water and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that the tunnels will benefit the environment and provide safer water supply to Californians.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to channel too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco River, harming North California and even more threatening local species.
Metropoles and other water supply management planning to obtain water from tunnels must still be obliged to pay for uncertainty as to whether large funds will actually provide enough water to pay it.
The same water supply management also announced this year that it would not pay for the completion of the current preparation work unless the project would first obtain the authorisation of the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, a monthly report published by the Management of Water Supply in Los Angeles on a tunnel project states that "the state has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be granted from state or federal budgets."
After all that local water supply management has spent on the project, including 63 million US dollars from its water supply management, "it is expected" that the state will use state money to complete the planning," said Bobs Muirs, a water supply manager in Los Angeles.
He then turned questions to Vogel, the student speaker.
Vogela said that the state is planning to grant money for the completion of the planning of tunnels from the payment of the existing 50-year-old water network, the State Water Project.
However, the tunnel construction opponents point to a regulatory regulation issued in 2009 which, in their view, allows the State to spend money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities benefit from them will not take payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project and they have used financial tricks to cover these commitments," said Patrizia Šiferle, environmental consultant and former planned tunnel opponents.
This raises questions about where this money was immediately found.
The business group's approach to the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has approached China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will damage trade and the island country.
The letter by China Prime Minister Li Kecjana has signed a panel of 46 from the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concerns that the rules could restrict or impede access to the security products market in China.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules provide that suppliers must show the Chinese authorities how safety products work and how information on Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday states that this data collection could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Thailand: since the tragedy last year
Zhangs Mengfans claims that the company has benefited from knowing what happened in Thailand.
China’s leaders are planning a series of memory measures to mention a wide-scale chemical explosion that struck 173 people on the first day of the year, but not all agree.
John Sadworth's report from Tiangjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a disaster that people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although the memorial service is held in the city of Taitjin for the memory of some dead firemen, other such memorials are excluded.
The controlled media of the Communist Party have been presented what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as the injured family members, have been warned not to speak to foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhangs Mengfans refused to listen.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he said to me.
I don't want to hear it.
On August 12th last year, Zhangs was a radio operator in a military firefight that was only a mile away from the explosion epicenter.
"The call was received at 22.53 p.m. this morning, and we started sending my team members," he said.
Instead of the event, they could enter within 10 minutes.
A large amount of fire - resistant chemicals were also used in the storage of commando from other parts of the city.
None of them took note of the fact that a large number of light and toxic substances have been illegally stored, overloaded, and without proper supervision.
Ugnusgray began when it was allowed that nitrocellulose - chemical substances used during the needle’s time - a party will emerge and then fire in the summer.
Then it spread across the vast area - 800 tons of ammonium nitrate butter.
The explosions were carried out with logs and fire-fighting deposit, where Zhangs Mengfans was waiting for news from the event site.
This information was not received either.
"When I had my hair cut off, I was crying out," he told me.
I knew what it meant to my friends.
Of the 26 firemen of his unit who were sent to the scene of the explosion, eight never returned.
Many others suffer serious burnout and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions were likened to the quake, and the explosion wave was felt many miles away.
The total amount of losses is estimated at more than $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In total, 173 people lost their lives, including 104 of whom were burned alive.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
Official government research authorities have agreed unanimously on corruption, political communications and official secrets, as a result of the adoption of rules and the neglect of security systems.
First of all, such a deposit could not be made near the home.
More than 100 officials and company management representatives have initiated a type of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So as long as the Government can point to the progress achieved - thousands of homes and compensations for the population, these sensitive issues remain current.
The tragedy has emerged in a broad system where rapid economic growth is a priority and a lack of independent monitoring is a fact.
That evening’s fear and duty are unquestionable, and yet without light as an image of the storm, the dangers are not always pleasing to the eye.
It has a fire extinguisher as a victim sent out without prior notice in a war against man - made disasters that could have been prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but will visit the memorial service in Tiangji.
He will take a message from the heart of his wounded companions.
Most of all I want to tell them: I've met your parents and they are well dressed.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as children.
The golden spring could affect the season of skeletal rubies
The harvest season will begin later in Scotland, as the number of birds has declined over the course of the cold season this year.
Several features have been eliminated because many of the new rubies have not survived in the cold winter conditions.
Noting the start of the season, the Scottish Game Managers Association (SGA) reports that the shooting of rubans provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Protection Welfare Fund calls for the end of "Brussels-flying".
"The work which is being invested in to ensure a large number of birds for hunting is huge and inevitably includes any activities which are completely contradictory."
There is no surprise that the society has avoided this so-called sport and calls on the government to prohibit unfair, unnecessary work that is being pursued by only a very small part of the population of Scotland.
Landowners also claim that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that mining is important for the development of the agricultural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8,800 full-time jobs in the less affluent regions during the year and that it has been a "rich job path" in insecure times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland is not so much affronted by the culture of "medium", and at least some of the population do not know how the season of shock affects the economy of the country."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the strike exceeded the number of jobs created in Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe Festival, Tatto Festival and Vecgada evenings.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently very disturbing, especially in the oil and gas sectors, so the players and their families want to see the sector's prosperity.
We want to work with the Government of Scotland to ensure that those who work hard can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight gold rings have been killed near the mine.
Many players recognize that the sound of rubies is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the sector "has taken significant steps towards better practice."
The day of the opening of the Ruben season is traditionally known as "Holy Twelve-year-old."
However, there is still much debate on this type of sport, and the management of mining sites is linked to the persecution of certain natural protection authorities.
On the fourth day RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years the mountains of Monday, southeastern Inverness, had lost eight gold rings.
The natural protection welfare fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the scene of robbery and their satellite processes have been destroyed.
Scotland's Environment Minister Rosanna Kaningema said these reports are "very disturbing and disturbing."
Ms. Kaningemas commissioned officials to analyse evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing suspects in order to determine whether there is a apparent trend in criminal activity.
The Cleaning Group also noted that there was no clear evidence that the birds had even gone into the ruins of the Montalita Mountains for attempts to stir up opposition feelings before the beginning of the mine season.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Paedža United Kingdom is causing acid in the trampling
The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain of Peedža is responsible for trampling acid
Briony Pejža became the first British woman to go to the medal at the Olympics in the trampling of Rio’s steel.
Pedža (25) to gold was missing 0.425 points, as Canada's representative Rosanna Maklenana has already expired the second Olympic title in line with the result 56,465.
The world champion, China's representative Lí Dana, was at the bronze stage, while second British finalist Catherine Driscoll graduated in the sixth.
I can't believe I've got an Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said the emotional Paige.
I didn't feel like it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so lucky that all the training and hard work had come back.
I am so happy that I was able to start at the end with Keta, already the participation of one representative in the final would be historical, but we were both there.
Prior to the end of the Olympic Games, Paige's highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramplining in the Olympic Games was introduced in 2000 and this is the first time British women have been released to the finish.
Metal reaction.
The only representative of the British team, Nathan Beili, was exaggerating on the sixth day of the tramline race.
Hanna Velana, who participates in the Olympic Games, soon began to celebrate the achievement of Paige.
Pejja has won the battle in biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fijian fans smelling gold medals in reggio-7
12-year-old son to watch the game, hit half the nerves in the fields of sugarcane to the nearest television
Fiji after it is recorded in the history of the first Olympic gold medallion beginnings of the unexplored degree of music
The bank closed, the store stopped and the fans took Suva's streets by dancing, singing and dancing
Fiji obtained gold medals at Deodoro Stadium Rebija-7 final with 43-7 covering Great Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country have stopped their work to see historical games.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medals
Many of the others were dressed in Fiji’s colors, and they raised their voices, wearing a national flag, and encouraging the team.
At the end of the game, the excited singers went to the streets, swimming and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles in the streets of Suvas and added to the events of Fiji's flag, not facing the small difficulties they have created," reports the Fiji Times.
The celebrations will also continue at the end of the week and next week.
Ireland Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Arons Mackenefs introduced the first two half-life sentences to the guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has moved to another Premier, winning convincing victory with a 5-0 battle with Finn Harps.
Aron Mackenefs launched a "confeque strike" in the direction of successful two first half-life sentences that were awarded for violations against Lukas Shubert.
Nathan Boils introduced the names at the beginning of the second half of the second half, and Schüberts defeated the opponent in the fourth quarter before the selected games in Kita Varda, ending the contest in Finnpar.
Derry is about one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game at Brandive on the evening.
It was Derry's first victory over his northern competitors this season, and they were bothering me on the HARPS side.
Makenefs sought the opening of the game at 17 minutes after Kirana Kola passed on to Shubert, although the crime appeared outside the prison.
There was no doubt about the second sentence of the former "Caramel Strip" half-way by Bariy Moloym, leaving Shubert to sink into the ground and Macenefam to arrive at the end of the second or third minute after the interruption.
The pain added a precise point after Dina Jérvis's play with the foot inside in the eighth minute after the game started.
Derry City hosted Jérard Dohertium was a quiet evening, but he managed to make great use of the names by surprised David Skallija's visitor to discover the best game.
Schübert was protected by the bomb for long hours before the explosion at the 83th minute, and soon followed by Varda's wisdom attack on the protection of Richard Brasch from the Harps Centre.
It was Derry's greatest victory in the race and great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Inverness College University of Higher Education and Island University (UHI)
A total of 20 students could be fired at the university of Inverness in the upper secondary course of UHI.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - old students who were expected to use the grades they received in their studies to enroll in the university.
The Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied by adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating this case.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the highest media assessment available throughout the country in 2016 is "notice as planned".
Twenty students enrolled in the course offered by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who had been taught online, but often they had to go to Inverness Colleges from their places of residence, such as Ločeiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media, he also heard at least 10 reports that he had not received any evaluation of his course’s work.
He told BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who took this course last year in the Inverness College said it was the same with them.
The situation means that her daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another university offer thanks to the qualifications she has received at school.
However, her father said that there were also others who visited the course organized by colleges who did not attend and who were now "forgotten" and uncertain whether their course's work would be reviewed and evaluated with a sign so that they could attend universities.
The UHI College of Inverness is part of the University of Upstaten and Island.
Diana Rovlinsone, UHI Director and Executive Director of the Inverness College said: "We are very important to the results of the exams and students' achievements."
This is also confirmed by the great review of His Majesty’s Education Inspection (HMIE) this year, as well as by the levels of achievement improved in both further and higher education years.
As every year, we make an overview of all published results, compared with each student predicted.
In this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out, and the evaluation body recently reported "the essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the evaluations were in accordance with national standards."
The SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been carried out as planned and that the candidates had an opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and had a slight increase in A-C performance compared with the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers in prison for Samurai's army "ass Spirits" in Kilmarnoka
Jason Braden is used or smoked by his teeth, nose and neck
Two brothers were imprisoned for killing a man with a samurai weapon after drug-related assault in Ireland, which was assessed "in the spirit".
Upuris Jason Bradens (38) was arrested several times at his home in Kilmarno on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court of Glasgow, James Clarka (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to imprisonment.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe torture without prior intent.
At the trial of the two men, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had committed "an inhuman, cruel and forested attack."
He rejected any admission that Mr. Braden was asleep and waiting for them, fighting with the Samurai army.
Justice Danlops adds: "You are planning an illegal entry with at least one nation and a bride."
Jason Bradens may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After two men were arrested, a criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said: "John and James Clark's violent and dangerous actions have caused Jason Braden's death."
In his case, at 38 years of age, there is such a heartbreaking situation that the family needs to survive.
The court had previously heard that the brothers from Kilmarnoka decided to seize Mr. Braden’s gold ring, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Two alcoholics and drug addicts came to her home, rubbed their faces with scars and armed with Nazi and Eastern fighters.
It is considered that the tooth used in the trap belonged to the deceased.
They said they had seen Clarkus break up on Braden when he sat on the sofa at the bedside and heard her screams.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the trial said: "The assault on this man was halted, haotish."
After that, the place of silence was described as "a spirit".
In addition to the attacks on the nasal doors of Bradens during the attack, there was a severe trauma with a number of objects.
Three days later he died in Kilmarnokas Croshaus Hospital.
Two brothers do not recognize each other in the dark.
In giving the evidence, James Clarks, who has already been tried 38 times, including a secret experiment, said: "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clarks, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was only involved in helping a brother who, he said, attacked Bradens."
A man is sentenced to torture and execution of his child's child
David Sinclair’s recognition of his son’s guilt in his home in Istkiklbraid in 2012.
A man who raped and killed his child’s child’s breast cancer because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years ’ imprisonment and three months’ imprisonment.
David Sinclair was four months old when Joshua "was suddenly lost control" at his home in Istkilbraid, South-Westland, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of the disease was explained only after the medical examination.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of fraud but was recognized as guilty of fraud without prior intention.
Judge Lords Breiseidls Sinkleram of the High Court of Glasgow, in his trial, said: "You will attack your child's child's age child by beating him, causing the attacks he's dying from."
Then when you threw him out, you should know it, but you didn't find it.
Only after basic medical research you will be identified.
Your wife believed you.
Now her feelings have been transferred and you can no longer support yourself.
Lords Breiseills described the consequences of Josh's death as "dangerous" to all and added: "Nothing will return to Josh."
Previously, the court had found that on the day that the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Lovely, had given up with Josh and bought it in Istkilbrid.
At 5.30 p.m. Dear Sinklere went to see her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinclair called, who heard "scoffed".
He said to her, "Joshua won't come as soon as he gets home."
Then he ended the conversation and called for 999.
The Jews were immediately taken to Hermar’s hospital, where they died.
At first, the cause of Josh’s death was not clear, but he was examined by a judicial team of medical experts who had observed the effects of the deaths in the eyes and brains of the eyes and brains of the victims.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, John Redcliffa, a child neurosurgeon in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been kidnapped and thus lost his self-esteem, as well as trapped with greater force than daily."
The defence representative, Jan Jügids, told the court that Sinkler was "very sorry".
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone threatened July's jefimo positions
The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain is released from the arms of bronze at 200 m in the swimming pool
The British representative of Hloja Tatone criticises the participation of the highly valued pilgrims, Julia Jeffimov, in Rio after the Russian representative awaits him at 200 m.
Eifimova, who was allowed to participate in the games after the complaint was lodged for the prohibition of participation due to a doping, was forced to leave Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I'd like it to be completely clean," said a 20-year-old Welsh friar.
I don't know what's going on there anymore.
I'm not satisfied with it, but it's now.
Efimova, who moved to another location, learned about his involvement in the game only three days earlier.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She was not required to participate in the contests, and for 20 years the former British representative had to wear a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in the 2016 Rio game, defeating Jefimov, who was on the steel medal.
China's representative Ginling This was on the bronze, only six hundred seconds after the fourth single Tatoni left.
Her British team member, 20 - year - old Molija Renšova, finished six years ago.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a little desire, the same as you are in front of," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little excited about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, it is already a great experience for me to come to the end with the years to come.
It was a little moving, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it makes me look more like a medal, so I hope I'll be closer to it next time.
Only 0.01 seconds left of the British record of women at the end of 200 m of bathing.
"Every man has to give a second chance," said Jeffimova.
Jeffimova, who said that he had already decided to answer questions about his doping past, defended his right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after having had an anabolic steroid legs found in her body.
The Court of First Instance (CAS) ruled that it was not possible for athletes to participate in Rio because they had already applied the sanctions.
The CAS examined my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and there's someone else's opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was definitely not my fault.
Each person must have a second chance.
When you go and write a sentence, no one's going to be in jail.
Bens Prauds is a place for 50 free style swimming
A British record was previously set up to destroy a 50 m free-style men's swimming end.
The Union champion Praud (21) launched the distance in 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth most highly qualified fifth-day final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is innocent and rude
Indian Sports Minister Vijajs Goels Rio Olympics has been an all-embracing personality, often held in tribunals, encouraging Indian athletes and taking up after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have evidently caused the smell of Olympic players to be caused by their uncontrollable behaviour by re-examined attempts to escape to the competition zones without adequate accreditation and disturbances by responding to inspections by the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijajs Goels, photographed in July, corrects his behavior.
On the third day Olympics organizers threatened to cancel Goela's accreditation if her behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter the restricted area of venous activity at the place and in the arsenic where planting and supply is taking place.
"We have received a number of reports that your sport minister has tried to enter accredited competition zones with people who are not accredited," wrote SARA Petersson, director of the Rio 2016 Committee of Organisations.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes the spirits came out for our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any other cases of such behaviour, your sport minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The head of the delegation of India called this case "from the mouth of the ziloni" and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as "translatable".
On the other hand, he wrote: "All I know is that we have complied with all the rules.
We're taking care of the Olympics and support our Indian athletes.
In other words, this Olympic game for India is all dreamy, and there are no medals.
Disillusioned fans in social media have shown that Michael Felps has won so many medals - 26 - as India has its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the poet Abhinov Bindra, who in Beijing in 2008.
This time he left the fourth.
The widow throws money and opportunity," Sardonic tweeted author and novel author Shoba De.
However, some hope remains, as there will still be in the competition box, golf, tennis, easy to play and, yes, in the bandminton.
The only Indian winemaker Dipa Karmakara will try to make a final holiday by showing his feared double round "Nava's rice", a Produno's holiday, which has been tried by just a few other winemakers.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, India’s low number of refined metals has always been a cause of conflict.
Analysts say there are countless reasons.
National prosperity is a cricket which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a major contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmak's first winning tool was prepared from parts of the old skirmish reserve.
Parents have always emphasized the academic awareness of the movement of sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport are taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has replaced the Indian Olympic Association for the violation of its statutes in 2012 as it has chosen leaders who have been proposed to be criminals.
Three North Indian players were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag or wearing any national symbol.
They'll see you as an independent sportsman.
For people, the turbulence of JetBlue plane route Boston-Sacramento is forced to land in South Dakota.
On Thursday evening, JetBlue was forced to perform an emergency landing after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, CBS Sacramento reported.
The 429 journey from Boston to Sacramento was canceled in Rapidsitia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 a.m. after local time.
The airline reported that the injured were brought to the hospital for testing.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the intruders, and to Rapidsitia has been banned from the reservation aircraft to deliver to other passengers Sacramento.
The drug control agency (DEA) has long held an opportunity for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: we don't believe it.
This is a loss of opportunity that may lead to further delays in the provision of treatment to countless people.
To date, there is only one scientific source at the University of Mississippi at the federal level approved for the use of medical marijuana.
It seems to be a little more positive in today's DEA also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the extent and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could be increased.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis on a good study, it will largely be symbolic, as no matter how many marijuana available, if access to it is still difficult, it will not be significant.
Think of a product that is very demanding but is kept behind closed doors.
Responding to the demand for goods, who will take a difficult decision to produce it more, but go and never close the door.
This product is marijuana and is listed in list 1 of these closed doors.
There is medical marijuana in this unpleasant situation.
Since marijuana is listed in list 1 (relevantly, after its definition "not currently approved medical use and there is a high potential for unforeseen uses"), there are significant barriers to door closure.
Potential researchers usually turn to DEA first because it gives permission to start scientific studies.
Even if authorisation is granted for the examination of substances listed in List 1, authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems that may be expensive.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of the authorisation from its academic authority to carry out studies on substances listed in list 1 for the first time.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or potential near results due to negative press reports.
This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Süu Sisli was released from office after attempts to face medical marijuana tests.
Finally, Syslija came looking for private funding for his project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, his project became the first approved medical marijuana experiment to prevent post-traumatic stress from the veterans.
Then, after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute for the Independence of Narcotic Drugs has believed in the last key.
It is now the largest federal financer for marijuana research and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if there will be an increase in the volume of medical medicine in free circulation, the institution will still need to confirm all the studies it has funded.
However, the problem is called "indiscriminate use".
The representative of the University of San Francisco Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary film "Marihuán", says that the principal task of the institution is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as a medicine.
Eibram will pay attention to an important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of the medical marijuana rather than its damage.
Note: In a quick (and, to be recognized, unscientific) search in the U.S. National Medical Library, 1,434 works were found in the past five years for medical marijuana.
In this same search, only 57 jobs were benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage caused by marijuana, for example, "Dangerous travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marihuan Pancreatitis caused by Pancreatitis" and "Marihuan use and risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportion causes the whole disintegration.
The road to the use of the medical marijuana is bred with surprises and luxury wherever the view of the pair is.
While the DEA bodies are on List 1, despite the medical impact, the U.S. Health and Social Affairs Department simultaneously maintains a broad range of medical purposes for cannabis patents.
The DEA continues to establish the potential of marijuana with heroin and LSD as a drug with high dependence, even though the DEA's own main administrative justice, Francis Yangs, is opposed to it.
In medical terms, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh cartridges may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to find so many marijuana to put death in place.
Marihuán in its natural form is one of the safest known therapeutic active substances known to man.
A reasonable analysis of marijuana may be safe in the course of monitoring.
It has to be said again that it has been proposed by the Dea's own judge.
And yet, almost 30 years later, a few things have changed.
Whether we realize it or not, all of us in our daily lives take a certain dose of delinquency.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud or we're so tired or confused that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As far as corruption is concerned in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, it must be sustainable to present the facts without undue delay.
Patients' lives, for example, Charlotte Fiji, whose steps are being reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
It is worth talking at the highest level about the fact that the soil can provide so much benefit and still find behind closed doors.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondis Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic music
The musicians say that Tramps dominates media like Berlusconi
You know, in Italy we're in touch with Berlusconi, and I think Tramps looks after the blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music bank association "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The President's post candidate and the political media magnet of Italy, both known for its overcrowded personalities, the ability to attract the attention of the press and the media to change history.
"Bloody Beetroots" consists of Rifo is familiar with his electronic music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Polu Makartniju and ending with the Greek Svabo Beçu in 2013 "Cronicles of a Fallen Love."
Ripo is born in Basáno del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which is about the time of the birth of pancreas, and the number "1977" is used for music on the chests.
"Angel language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," said Rifo, hiding behind the black fees he is familiar with.
I'm trying to study, and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Ripo called on the Americans to see a documentary film "Videocractija", which was studied by Berluskoni monopol over the Italian media.
The documentary film is about how "Berlusconi made the Italian track," said Rifo, adding that Trampam had a similar impact on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and release everything... according to his own," he said.
I think Tramps isn't good for this country.
Two Turkish seafarers have been imprisoned for more than 500 million steel trucks in the case of drugs
Two Turkish men were sentenced to more than 500 million tons of cocaine contraband on board a ship in the North Sea, each being held in prison for at least 20 years.
Mamin Sahins and Emin Ozmens were recognized as guilty after the trial in the High Court of Glasgow after about 100 Jews from the Abedina coast to "MV Hamal" were found to be three tons of A-class drug.
Detention in 2015 is the largest single supply of cocaine that has ever been placed on the sea in Europe.
Mama Sahin and Emina Ozmenam are being held in prison for her role in a major drug problem
A serious cargo of drugs found on the ship is one of the greatest British history
Drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped secret to Tanzania by a ship registered from Smula to Tenerif and then to the North Sea.
It stopped the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the HMC Valiant border force.
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Ozmens (51) is sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
Judge Lord Kinkleivens told men that the amount of drugs was "not only significant but serious", and drug smuggling has "a serious impact" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved commercially in the most important operation, including the carriage of cocaine with ships, the operation that crossed the international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not "drug at the end of the tree", but he had a significant role in the criminal offence, while the role of Captain Ozmena was "something smaller".
The inspectors arrived at Hamal following information received from the French customs authority DNRED, and when it arrived in Aberden, they were struck through a steel plate by accessing a dark section containing 128 wires of cocaine with a weight of 3.2 tonnes, as the value on the black market is approximately 512 million arrowheads.
"MV Hamal" checked the Royal Fleet last year.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
In the examination of ships, it was found that its ballast holdings have been damaged by tonne of class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the coast of Bosfora to South America before being stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the roof of one of the crew's premises, and the mirror was sealed.
Sahins and Ozmens were recognised as guilty of the carriage of cocaine and of the ship during the past year from 20 February to 23 April and of the delivery of cocaine from 21 April to 23 April.
Two unaccompanied men who have been working in the shipping sector since the end of school have continued to claim that they are not guilty, but they have taken the judgment.
There is no evidence for the charges against four other men.
Sahin's lawyer Jonathan Crovs said that the father of two children was a "Glorified Wall".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive the ships.
In view of the drug hierarchy, Sahins certainly is not at the end of the tree but somewhere below.
The small amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be transported by road
The police went through the whole ship for days before the drugs were distributed through these boxes.
When Sahina asked questions about her captain's work at Hamal in February 2015, the court listened.
Mr. Krova said that he was "choked" because of the need to keep the events of important girls (9) and children (13) and "just want to go back to Turkey".
Two men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as families are still fighting to obtain visas.
Osmen's lawyer Di Mürs said he "was lucky" wanted to see his family, but he knows that in the future it will "not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, Scotland's prosecutor David Harvijs said: "The international drug trade has no border, and we, whose task is to do so, are working harder together to achieve that we are one step forward.
"The success of Scotland in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to the organised crime representatives."
The drugs were planted on all sides of the ship, including under the stairs.
This contraband package inspectors have found a hidden vessel in the area of the ship's meat
Mr. Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified after the information received from the French authorities and after the rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship was registered, the General Prosecutor who also allowed him to board the ship.
"Our investigation then provided access to essential data on shipments from Guyana to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on ship stocks on Canary Islands.
We have also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to gather together specific evidence elements.
Despite the basic opinion that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters were unable to climb it without the permission of the Government of Tanzania - something that they had never given before.
Mr Peiten, President of the Royal Criminal Court (CPS) of the International Court of Justice and the Director of the Organized Crime, said: "With rapid and precise action, the CPS Criminal Justice Council was able to obtain permission from the authorities of Tanzania to board the ship within 24 hours of receipt of the information.
In accordance with international maritime rights, British authorities do not have the right to board international waters on a ship that is under the flag of another State unless that State has a special legal permit to do so.
Without our quick action by the Criminal Council, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we would never be able to call these people responsible.

Photo by Braiens Romeijzn from Rotterdam This distance of train has taken pictures of the train in Belgium
The pictures are visible at the centre of the train's gas station, sealed seats, with windows on the roofs and a narrow car cabin
It has already been called a East Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The city's scientist has taken these major photographs, where the remains of passengers who have once been one of the best forms of movement are seen.
It's been a long time ago, and the train wagons and trucks have been allowed to land the train deposit in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photo and experience search engine.
Photograph by Braiens Romeijzn, 40, has taken these horrible photographs that are seen in the windshield inside the train, sealed seats, with empty rooms and sealed manager's cabin
The Vulciena vans and lomotives have been allowed to land the train deposit in Belgium, where they have become an object of popular photography and experience searchers.
These trains were a symbol of gravity when they worked with the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian National Railway Company used Lokomotively about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of skiing, the last train operating with the name of the East came from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009 at the end of the famous period of history.
The Eastern expression was famous on the Paris route - Smong.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as "Express d'Orient".
It became an expression of the East in 1891, and by the 1930s, it had become a regular route throughout Europe.
This should not be mixed with a private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
There is a very small "Company Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagon.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open lines are still installed in the dry machinery cabinet in which the equipment is in the type.
The novelist said that the machine cabinet is "in its own words claustrophobic, and the lomotive trick has certainly been unstoppable."
In the distance, lomotive and vans have become an object of popular photography and experience search.
After visiting a lost train in Belgium, Rominjs MailOnlineTravel said: "I could really feel how it was used in its time of harvest."

Grime Artist Katherine Geloveja top series "Arrested Development" in Blasta
Thanks to her impressive crime skills, reviews and reviews, Texas and YouTube census Ketlyna Geloveja has joined the fans army.
However, her latest reviews of the "Arrested Development" Bluta from the "Arrested Development" are totally unbelievable by any standards.
In the three-minute long video clip, which is uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelovija is slowly and continuously turning herself into an unsuccessful picture with a face on her hand.
She even used an audio recording at the end of the clip from this dangerous but even during the great performance.
The talented greme artist begins his video in his, blonde woman's face.
Then, with the help of moving photographs, she slowly turns into a brilliant "member girl" with her hair cut off, and she's Tony Heila Baster's Blue.
Geloveja does this by coloring contact lenses, rinsing and touching the edges around the fire and the eyes, as well as marking the Bster's face on its head.
Gudri's approach: She's cleverly using a slow photo, she's slowly turned into Tony Heila Baster's Blue.
In its video she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV picture, including the zodiac.
The video set up on YouTube has seen more than 45,000 times, and the most quickly showed famous comments on the art of music:
"You're extremely talented," a person wrote under the video posted by Geloveja.
In her video she also takes over the cultural TV picture personality and manners
"I like how you do everything you do in the picture," added another.
Videoblogger Ketlyna Geloveja had previously been successfully converted into Ron Svenson's "Parks and Recreation" picture.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future there is hope of making a greme change every week.

A father in Lancashire comes from a school of children about T-crek with the names of children
Two children's father was expelled from school for entering their sports day at T-crek with a shocking record.
Kreig Makbets (36) from the city of Börnli in Lancashire said that he "knows" was calling the Creature with the title "Laizam and Dr. am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mistake and caught the other T-crells, he noticed that he was forbidden to enter school territory the next day.
The only father who has been working for four years as head of the Park Home School in Kolna, Children was unable to enter the children's home because of the ban, and staff even called social services and police.
Kreig Makbets (36) from the Children said that he was not involved in school territory after he had gone to a school-based T-crecl.
Mr. Childlia, the school director, Mr. Saru Mijlija, is accused of overreacting.
He says he's unduly punished for making a mistake after a quick call to T-crek before you go to see his two children's match.
The father, who no longer works as a school director, said, "It was a mistake and a misunderstanding on my part."
I don't think about a sports day and I'll be surprised when I get it.
At the end of the event, we had a father's match, and the director noticed my T-crek and said that it was not appropriate.
I apologized and threw it on the other side, and this also ended.
However, 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the school president that he had been invited to speak with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the school director called me and said I was forbidden to enter school territory," said Mr. Börnly.
I knew that after the day of sports some parents had spoken about their fears on the Facebook page and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable person would say that it is overexpressed.
Mr. Macbeta, who is an online editor of Love Mini, said that, of course, he couldn't even come back to the children on the last day of the month because of the ban.
However, this was a reason for calling from school and social services.
On the T-crekla was a Greek Čarlza painting Lister from the BBC cult comedy "Sarkanais rhoki" with one of his iconic words "Laizam and Dr. am."
He commented: "I thanked them that I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then she called me from the social services and asked why I was not going to be with her.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school rooms and that the ban would be in force until further notice.
He also said that he had been warned that he could apply the 500-billion-circuit fine if we were to fail to comply with this rule.
Sarah Medžlija, Director of Park's Home School, said that this case is now over.
Sarah Medžlija, Director of Park's Home School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. McBeta has resigned from office and is no longer our school director."
This case is now over, and I hope to go back to school in September."
The city councillor John Könijs said that schools have clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to bear in mind that by taking such positions as a consultant or director, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he does not respond to these standards," he said.
Councilman Jonathan Nixon adds that he did not think that he had to apply a ban on school and that there was a cyclone out of the mustache.
Mr. Nixon added: "This T-cracking was boring, and he apologized for it too."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had called from school, but they did not leave.
The last few years have been renewed by the former VEF premises located on the Free Road - there are several IT companies, the sector has already begun to call this area a local Silicon road.
The other VEF territory, including Bärzaunes, has also been developed.
The LU Academic Centre in Turnnakal will pay EUR 21 million for the development and construction of the second series of projects.
In conclusion, the purchase by the University of Latvia on the Academic Centre in Tornákal, Riga, 2nd regular technical project development, construction and self-sustainment shows a notice on the website of the Procurement Supervisory Office.
The purchase shall be carried out in the form of a negotiation procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the LNK Industry Group, which has undertaken this work for EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by the University of Lu, starting with the planning and implementation of the projects for the 2014-2021 programming period of the European Union Fund, the Academy complex continues its next series - the Science Centre Building - the design, self-sustainment and construction, in accordance with the Skies project and the precise year of construction.
The type of basic operation of the Science Centre shall be similar to the design and construction of the Natural Sciences Academy building and its existing operation, which is similar to the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building following the most important technical and technological parameters.
The competition provision was accompanied by a project of SIA’s sixth style which provided all possible suppliers with information on the vision of the University of Latvia Academic Development Centre in Tornäkal, including a list of the objects planned by the University of Latvia Academic Centre which shows the name of each particular object, the expected scope of the object, the year of the project’s transfer and other information.
At the end of 2015, the SIA’s sixth style carried out the meta-territorial corrections of the complex of buildings of the former University of Latvia, which resulted in the establishment and interconnection of buildings of the Academic Centre, as well as the transport organisation of the meta-t territory and its surroundings.
It shall be published in the section of the road section for application of the medicinal product.
The holder of the VAS Latvian road transport system shall inform the LAU of the purchase of the mechanized medicinal product for the purposes of transport of road sections in the regions of Latvia and Pirega.
The subject of the purchase is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jakabpils, Jelgavas, Rēzekne, Valmieras, Talsu and Riga roads.
The tenderers may submit an offer for one or more Lots.
Swelling in road sections is necessary to improve road traffic transparency and their adjacent areas, to promote water discharges from the road, and to limit the movement of the product and the formation of the bridge.
The most dangerous fishing activities for farmers in the Talsu road area are on 28 roads of 637 km of passage, 20 of Valmiera roads of 432 km of passage, and 17 of the road of destination of 384 km of crossing.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed its work on national main and major regional asphalt roads, but on the regional roads and on the local road, VAS was planning to entrust farmers with part of the mining work carried out by the bus operator of Latvia.
"We have this opportunity to make more efficient use of the funding available for road maintenance, while giving farmers the opportunity to fully implement and benefit from the technology," said VAS car maintenance director Vladimir Kononovs.
The deadline for submission of tenders is 22 August.
Jurisdiction: Demoggiogy on the mandatory health insurance model with additional financial burdens on the population is not critical.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose direct and high burden on the people of paying no criticism is considered by Justice Juris Janson.
Janson today met with Health Minister Andu Chaksu to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Janson told journalists that the model of funding offered by the Ministry of Health is a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it available to patients.
He also noted that additional funding for health care should be discussed in this case, since this is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose direct and high burden on the population does not hold any criticism, especially when the Netherlands model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands' health would allow 11% of the total domestic product, while Latvia only 3%.
Therefore, the Government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that the point of this sentence is to be removed from the point of view of the law and that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work otherwise.
She thanked the lawyer for his support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should be approached by a doctor who, in turn, means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister also pointed out that with the planned additional EUR 35 million this year, it will be possible to make only the most serious cases for oncologists and birth specialists' remuneration.
The VM has thus developed a plan and has submitted an additional €41 million for health care to reduce lines to specialists and research.
"The question of priorities will be whether there will be funds or not," said Czecha.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that the doctors are not concerned about the fact that VM’s examination of all three health care funding models is aimed at the government, including those that provide for additional payments for patients, the Czech Government said that, in the course of all three models, the government is given the opportunity to develop.
Janson also adds that, in the direction of all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not ready for additional pressure on the population.
It has already been reported that VM will protect their health care financing model option, which does not provide for the increase in the total tax burden, but calls for a part of the social tax to be transferred to health, as stated in the summary of the conceptual report on the change in the model for the financing of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, both the Ministry indicated that the best option for the funding model for health care will be selected as a result of the discussion by the end of September.
The locals are ready.
By this year, it has become known that Grobinjas, the new Farmer of the Woods, is an Aryan farmer, Roland Dambis.
It's already on the Liepaja market.
A number of early varieties have begun but the latest bombs have been well planted, the regional newspaper Kurssa Time.
"This year it's growing better than last year," says the grown-up farmer in Rucava's department, Artis Küusis.
The weather is also much better in terms of weather than it was in the past when it was cold and wind.
The opening show of the Liepaja theatre in Riga.
On August 12th and 13th, Diles' theatre in Riga will be visited by the Liepaja theatre, offering both the "Playing Night" prized performances, as well as the bright interior – the director of the Liepaja theatre, Herbert Laukštein, will inform the portal "Delfi" of the theatre's representatives.
On the evening of August 12th, viewers will be shown the human drama "Zilońkilök" studied by director Laura Groza-Kibere.
This is the story of a real historical person - John America - who lived in Victorian times in London and in his body because of the deformed body of the disease born was called Zilonjilwek.
In the study, title is represented by actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the title "The Night of the Games" for American role.
As the critic of Normand's Akots described his actions, Merik is "through the heart cast" a role in which the sex scene is not repeated".
On August 13th, the “Portrets” will be offered to viewers.
The exhibition has received six "Playing Night" nominations, including "A great show in the shape of Christmas".
The director's education was designed as a natural portrait gallery, as it is important to give each play picture, so that each of them has both a centre and a background.
The exhibition consists of several mini exhibitions concluded in the single universe.
It is a observation of a person’s nature, where the main conflict between true emotions and a sharp calculation, by slowly discovering how a person changes in different situations - each of the waves is a wave, which, because of its wealth and well-being, is sometimes a wave of things that someone has accumulated.
On the other hand, both of these data will be played in the small medicine of Liepaja's theatre director Herbert Lauskstein's solo exhibition "Man who has moved away from the elevator" in Galina's Polish regime.
It's not sad, but humor is full of stories about how a person's only friend becomes a lift.
Despite the capsted style that dominates the display in the visual image, however, the dominant intuition of the study is clear and even optimistic.
"The man who comes from the elevator" is not about loneliness and age, but about the value of life to love.
Also, if there's nothing to do about it," wrote critic Liga Ulberte about the show.
Tickets for all studies can be bought on the "Bike Paradises" boxes and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serial but a real life.
I've already been waiting for Olga Zelíka - the owner and researcher of the Riga Detective Agency.
Her brains smile and leave a very positive effect on a person.
There will be white buses and white jackets - a very elegant woman who will provide all my ideas on what to be a woman-detective.
She's waiting for me with the champagne, which I'm going to respond to.
I'm saying I'm talking to him because I think it's interesting that a woman is working on such an unusual thing.
It's always a man's job.
Olga is the highest legal education – Master's degree.
He worked in the criminal police.
Realizing that they want something for themselves and have built up their own company.
That's what you've done.
"I really don't want to go back to the police," says Olga.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the case and collected information.
We're dealing with suspects.
"Today we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency."
She's calling for a jubilee party: "There won't be a party."
They're all loyal people.
Asked about her business, Olga said to her, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a command.
Then I realized that working on the team is sometimes dangerous.
This is a business where, if someone is employed in a non-professional way, it can become very bad.
If journalists are fifth power, then we are second.
The sphere, of course, is not simple.
Many try to buy us out because we are dealing with the corruption of life.
Let people think about it!
Many come and ask whether hearing equipment can be placed, touch dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's collecting information," says Olga.
If a crime is committed under the law, I need to be warned about it.
At the bottom of the lake, your father is green and smiling - so that you can be at least a heart to hold on to and talk about.
I've been a client whose husband is always sitting.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a maniac.
It's always nice and good at first, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
Psyche's on the ground, and it happens that you can stand against the thief.
That was done wrong.
Do not give God a life of suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to walk away from their families and then come back," she says.
I'll give up the last order.
"It happened the first time in my life," explains Olga.
There was such an emergency.
The woman was pregnant, she had a son.
"The husband of his son sat down and made him disabled," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a mother’s instinct, and firstly, she needs to protect her child.
When it all happened, she came to me asking me to leave her husband’s house.
There are people who are affected by apathy.
The most dangerous thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a link once, and your dog was very helpful.
There is no way to get out of the drug section without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are enough people and there are those who don't have a whole Psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are current.
The family is also divided and information needs to be collected.
It is explained which party is responsible.
The last thing I’ve ever heard about is that I’ve been involved in other associations.
It's interesting because sometimes men smile, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women 'take' money for 100 and over a thousand euros.
Women need to be cautious about going abroad because they can sell them in a store.
"Latvies' women are intelligent and very confident," Olga says.
There have been cases when they go abroad to be bought again.
That's not legal.
Olga relates that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
It's growing, it's yellow hair.
When I was 22, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe headache.
He came back like a completely different person.
"I'm him," Olga remembers.
It can be compared to a lion, it was dangerous.
The question is what is the most unusual thing that has happened to you, Olga says: "It's all special, but it's the most
When the stolen "take" is stolen.
Take off and don't give money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is right as a detective, the other is to be," says Olga.
When we deal with situations of uncertainty, there are always difficulties, since women are often not ready for the solution.
She's not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation because man is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman was willing to accept the reality.
Often, young girls who feel a lot of money are used by wealthy men.
One man who followed his wife said that she could not be loved because all the women were lying to her.
"He was good three times," Olga recalls.
At that time, there is already a man's problem if all women are lying to him.
Olga relates the case when a woman with all the children left her husband and asked him if he ever had a hand on her.
In general, I've always been there for him, he answered.
In such cases, I shall be responsible for working.
I think it's interesting how things are solved - or taking photographs and showing up for a lifetime if there's evidence of fraud.
How does that happen?
"Protection of physical persons' data exists in parallel to the work of detectives," says Olga.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows us to do everything, one - nothing.
For personal interests, we can take such photographs and videos but not for public viewing.
If the court provides non-legislative material, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, insufficient education and experience must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, so the police are working on them.
I told the customers - get out of the series, there's real life here!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs were also used, they were very helpful.
"There is no way out of the drug section without dogs at all," says Olga.
Some of my clients are looking at me with regard to the search for secrets, but I don't like to accept such things.
They're very serious.
There are now more and more clients of men because women even care about men.
There were times when it was different.
Now women are dating, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, most people suffer properly," says Olga.
I like Deils Carnegie.
He says - stop stopping and start living real life.
We all know that if you're sitting next to one child, you're gonna have to push the other one, but you can't!
You've got to say it's unpleasant to you.
It must not be done.
Do not be afraid to lose out on life!
You shouldn't be a masochist, and what happens to us is what we're allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly related to the husband’s mistrust when the woman was unwilling to accept the fact that the husband was lying to her.
She called all the time and asked what to do.
"I am now asking all clients whether she is willing to accept the situation when she realizes that a man is really lying to her," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you're here and a pay detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, it's a show, but a real life.
I also need a specialist.
It's a heart thing and it's related to Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working with that?
It's related to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to digest yourself.
The need is not only to heal but to restore energy, lighting.
"People come out of my office positive and satisfied," says Olga.
She has needed signs at the wall office, and Olga says that she writes them, not with the help of the dog, but with the fingers.
I didn't just do it until I got there, the book about my needs literally stuck in my hands.
Feel it like a sign.
However, it is very personal.
More information is needed here.
Olga's singing too.
It's her haircut.
We're all in trouble.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've written songs and clips.
I'm positive and sad, but I need to rest to get back.
I need some other alcohol.
Alcohol in the stomach.
The police use it very much because work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression and can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and needs.
He's 15 years old. He's unemployed. He's a tennis player.
I still liked going with the horses.
I'd like to write a book.
There's a small limit to detective work when work comes into your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be taken in life," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life, Olga says, "My dear man is in Italy."
We have a very strong feeling.
At that time there is the greatest love in my life.
I'm good enough to think about them, and I'd feel better already.
The detectives don't usually believe it, but he's accepted my job.
In fact, I'm off the job of private life.
I didn't get into this business the same way.
The need has turned me in.
When I was a child, I saw more than anyone else.
Thanks to the needs, open intuition.
There's a lot of detectives, but really working -- little.
In any case, it's work with the brains, and it's hard to shut down.
You also need to rest.
" Otherwise you can't come back," Olga admits.
The most powerful case I've ever worked on is the story of Constance.
I've been working on it for years.
The man was deliberately jealous of his wife.
I did so that my mother and I, however, had a baby to travel to England - away from the dangers.
Don't be afraid of another variant.
We shouldn't be sorry.
We're looking for empathy.
You can't do that.
Every day we have to make a living.
Thank God.
Every day you have to tell someone else three good things.
A good job or a good day's work must be done.
We don't have to fight it with men.
It's a big mistake.
Of course, we have a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to push and walk away.
You can go to the church, it's very helpful.
You don't have to be a boyfriend, but do what you like and help.

In no case should you subject yourself and your children to threats.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans were created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we are already needed and are no part of this world.
You must never sit on the ground!
The best way to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still full of summers, and the same is true of the regular school year that the family can enjoy in the phototames.
To make the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth thinking about how to prepare for the photo session before.
The advice "Ihappyma" is given by Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It must be photographed in nature because it is much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, it is much more difficult for children to get in and out of bed.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of dress for the entire family, one of which is a color age.
For example, Alexandra relates that she selects clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three colors on the tone and possibly less inscriptions on the suit.
Don't forget about good timing.
Sit down, smile, play, but in no case will you feel uncomfortable or sad if your child is not as obedient as you would like.
And, look, the next advice is already being taken from a professional photographer's search for cargo!
You need to understand exactly what you want to do during the photo session and tell about their photographs.
For one they will be beautiful, curious children and ideally designed family image, for others - "life is what it is", i.e., in the images of a desire to see real, real emotions, or, as I love to say the same photograph, - "a running mouse", "a focused eye", "smoothed degungal".
Of course, you may expect someone to want "two in one", but that happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to a photosession, you need to understand that it's only a couple of hours from your life, and it'll be less intelligent because it's better.
You are yourself - not even a strong mother who works, ready to eat, raise and keep it, and not a hired father who doesn't speak on the phone at all.
Nor is he the man who lives behind some unknown creature.
Be a family, remember how great it is to look at each other, to smile at those who belong to us, and to smile at us.
And then the task of photography will be to bring only real miracles to the emotions that govern between you.
If you chose a photograph, you would trust him.
It is time to ask 250 times to show what has been achieved when she has heard of her choice of clothes instead of the best frames.
Store and store all the necessary clothing in advance in order to avoid working on photosessions.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photosession site (especially when photography takes place in the study and time is limited).
If you have a small child, then choose the time for the photo session that corresponds to the day-to-day mode so that it doesn't happen when the baby usually sleeps.
And, of course, do not forget to take with children food, vegetables, water and the most popular roulette (but in extreme situations only).
Father prepares that he may need to remove tears, but he usually doesn't write about it, and only photos know what the problem is, recognise Marina.
There's plenty of water in the evening before the photosession and before it's over.
And it would still be recommended after the photosession to gather all together some kind of entertainment.
Go to the attractive park, find some sweetness, get in touch with the critters - which is more suitable for the family.
At the same time, you will have enjoyed great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: A minimum wage payment - a surprise or a brake for the economy?
The issue of minimum wage recovery in public debates is almost or is of the status of the holy cattle: whether it should now be supported, or whether it should be remembered by some unexplained, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (only the buttons avoided from technical recession), it is important for us to stress that the creation of a minimum wage is not a surprise which is not at all at the level of Latvia's Western pay and will complement the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum wage is too much, it is more damaging than good because its creation reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, particularly in the sectors and regions with low income.
In the first instance, it appears that, despite a number of minimum wage increases in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that it would significantly undermine the competitiveness of companies in some ten euros a year - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries there are about half a thousand minimum wages.
However, in comparison with the average wage in the country (%) the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) is higher than the EU average.
Since Latvia has a significant share of minimum wage recipients than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6% [1]), a similar minimum wage rate is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the Latvian Bank’s consultations, each fifth Latvian company replied that, by increasing the minimum wage in early 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, minimum wage increases were partly financed by consumers (i.e. the Latvian people); secondly, increasing prices meant loss of competitiveness for several companies both within the internal market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
In view of the higher levels of competitiveness and production of alcohol, almost every 15-year-old Latvian company was important to select workers (i.e. more unemployment and migration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for them to limit the employment of new workers in the area of minimum wage recovery.
It is worth remembering that the minimum wage in Latvia did not change in 2011-2013.
Therefore, even if, on the basis of the 2014 minimum wage creation, each fifth company has noted the importance of improving productivity, this does not mean that similar results could also be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase could lead to a series of opportunities for productivity recovery).
Another important result was that, due to the level of the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the remuneration of their employees, which would benefit more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was important even for companies where no employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the growth in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, a further undisputed increase in the minimum wage (even though the overall level of the euro is quite low) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
In assessing the rationality of minimum wage recovery, an analysis of the average economic indicators is not sufficient.
It should also be assessed whether minimum wage creation is in the "panesama" sectors and regions where minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the Latvian Bank’s survey show that employees with minimum wages are the highest concentration in small businesses (from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of minimum wages workers in the industry and services sectors was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgalei, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), can be affected by its subsequent rise by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining its high unemployment) and promoting the economic sustainability of pay.
Some of the signs show that the minimum wage thresholds implemented in 2014-2015 (up to 27%) have weakened Latgale’s development.
For example, Latvia is the only Latvian region where unemployment was higher in 2015.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would remain so significantly behind the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the minimum wage established in the country.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Tarages region, but also there were 54% of the average wage in 2015 (by two rapid minimum wage increases this figure could reach 58% in 2016).
The public discussed the temporary call for a minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage country (see, for example, here) to lack economic justification, and this is not implemented either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high number of average wages or even so close is not available in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean a minimum wage on average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean banknotes and discounts of these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector in Latgales.
The creation of a minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make a minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the EU's highest.
If nominal productivity is increased by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as fast as it is, there is no doubt a negative impact on business competitiveness and employment.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in those sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is already frequently used in Latvia, for example.
The fact that significant minimum wage increases are currently not allowed means that other mechanisms should be used for the support of low wage beneficiaries.
The impact of the thousands can be achieved by travelling through the unavailable minimum of income tax (at budgetary limits).
Inadequate level of education, inadequate quality of education and poor quality of education and inadequate health status (which is often due to lack of medical care due to productivity and long-term lines) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the review, 521 responses were received by the Latvian company on the response to the minimum wage increase in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees not less than 10.
It also explains the ratio of low staff to minimum wages in construction.
In Latvia, 11 fires registered on the last day show operational information from the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
The largest fires in the area of the Ogrès were caused by fires in the area of Ogrèsgal, where 80 square metres of fire were located in the unmanaged house and Jäkabpil, where the fire was clearly filled in 30 square metres.
On the fourth day, fire extinguishers also came up with names containing fires, guns, two light cars, wall and stoves, pipes, living house roofs, and unsupervised food supply.
During the day, the service also participated in 21 rescue work.
There are no reports of injuries, injuries or rescues.
During the general Sunday, VUGD responded to 38 of the names of six of which were defamatory.

The Russian Vice-President of Riga will communicate with the ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedeve, Deputy Minister of Transport Arkady Dvorkovich, believed in the fish processing industry "Kaija" with three ZZS politicians - finance ministers Danu Reiznieci-Ozol, Minister of Transport Uldi Auguli and Minister of Agriculture Jani Düklavu, writing portal "seesi.lv".
As indicated by the portal, none of the persons involved have been informed of such incidents, but the fact that the incident occurred has confirmed the responsibility of reisnice-Ozola for the organisation of the secret negotiations by bringing them to Düklav.
On the other hand, the Minister explained that the organizer was Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Vešnákov.
The Minister of Finance has discovered that negotiations have been an opportunity to abolish sanctions for fishermen, as well as whether Russia will continue to " pump" the gas in the Inchukalna gas tank.
Dvorković has explained that this is not a matter of government but of an energy company.
In contrast to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the negotiations.
The Ombudsman reasoned that he had not seen such a need, since "the Minister of Foreign Affairs is thus on vacation", a post post.
Ikaunice-Admidinja takes 14 places after two disciplines in Rio.

Legendary editor Hafingtone says "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafingtton, assistant editor and main editor of The Huffington Post, an influential US media holder, announced the withdrawal from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded by the Pulicera Prize, which offers a major policy and economic journalism every day, as well as a reflection of Internet sensations in e-mails, is considered to be media development in the short term when digital technology solutions were rapidly developed.
The media, which had already started work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time under conditions where there was no tweet, but the feisbus gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Not long after the re-election of the representative of the Republican party, George Bush, the U.S. President Hafingtone did not hide that media journalists represent liberal values, and such a world view will also produce news materials.
Now Hafingtone has discovered on Twitter that he is preparing to start a new business after the start - his plan is to create a "Thrive Global" initiative that will address the health and burden of workers.
We do not know what might be in place under "The Huffington Post".
During his work, the portal rejected anonymous comments by Hafington stressing that freedom of speech is granted to people who are concerned about what they say and who do not hide behind the anonymity.
In the same way, in the summer of 2015, it was decided to publish information on the US President's candidate, Donald Trampu, to publish the release in the press.
At the end of 2015, the Court stated that Trampa’s rhetoric was dangerous to the US public, and the information on an audio candidate was again published in the policy section.
It has been reported that in 2011, the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase a fast growing news site The Huffington Post, which visited nearly 25 million readers each month during the transaction.
The amount of the transaction amounted to $315 million.
On the other hand, in 2015, the volume of telecommunications Verizon purchased AOL for $4.4 billion.
In 2016, Verizon bought parts of the Internet business "Yahoo" in 2016.
So far, "The Huffington Post" has become a small part of the big corporation.
Currently, the media of the famous brand is available in nine international editions, the total number of unique visits per month is 81 million.
Four people were killed in the earthquake.
During the last 24 hours, nine explosions took place in Huahin, a small town in the district of Thailand and in the south of the state, where at least four people were killed and several dozens were injured, the authorities announced on Friday.
On Friday, about eight o’clock after the local time, two explosions occurred in the southern province of Suratthan.
One explosion exploded in front of the sea police building, killing municipal officials and killing a man, told Governor Vongsiri Promčana of the province in Suratthan.
"I think it's related to explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
A second explosion occurred in front of the provincial police station.
In the south of Thailand, two explosions occurred on Friday morning on the island of Phüketa.
On Friday morning, in Huahin, two explosions exploded at a bell tower, killing one and killing three people.
It has been reported that on Thursday night shortly before midnight in Huahin, the city of Kurtord, there were two explosions, killing one woman and killing 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman who was killed in Huahin on the fourth day was a farmer.
Of the 19 injured, three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners — four women and three men.
Bombas Huahin had been hidden in two dolls, which were located some 50 metres apart.
The discrepancies were detonated by mobile phones at half an hour.
Four days earlier, one man had suffered a fatal accident in the province of Tranas in southern Thailand.
The police rescue the child from traffic jam; the parents are threatened by the court.
Last night, municipal police rescued the child from a broken car, while the child's parents threatened the police with court acts of an abandoned car glass, LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Last night at the patrol, the man who told me that the shopping center Spice had noticed a car in which half of the children were without an adult presence.
On arrival at the location of the event, a vehicle indicated by the battery driver was found which was located in the sun.
There was a child sitting in the front passenger seat where a baby was found.
The child was hit by the sun’s star.
The Jewish horn was broken, the strong breath poured out, and his face was broken and withered.
Given that the owner of the vehicle has not been found on the ground, a decision shall be taken without delay to issue a rear-view glass to prevent the health and life of the child.
A child with all seats is removed from a related vehicle and called a doctor.
The child’s respiratory tract was contaminated and hot, so until medical intervention, the blood pressure on the chest was reduced to the blood pressure.
At the same time, doctors and the child’s parents came to the scene.
The father of a child, who is raising a log onto his vehicle, is aggressive and does not allow the child to be present.
Discussions with parents have been conducted and it has been explained that children up to seven years of age are prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left with a life - threatening condition.
After the discussion the doctor examined the patient and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents had categorically refused to provide any explanations about what had happened and threatened the court’s work on the car’s glass.
During the conversation with the parents, there was nothing to indicate that they were in the habit of alcohol or that they could otherwise harm the child, so a minor four - month - old child was given both care.
The material shall be sent to the Child Lawyers' Prevention Section, which shall assess the responsibility of the parents.
The RPP recalls that even if it is not very hot out there, the car left in the sun is very slow.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it can endanger his life.
LPF members may request the resignation of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Federation of Peldements (LPF) may, in the near future, request the President of the Federation to withdraw its current leader, Kasparu Poni, who was informed by LETA by former vice-president Jānis Dzenis.
In view of the criticism of Poni and his activities in the federation in recent days, several LPF members have signed a letter requesting the name of the LPF Assembly, which is the highest federal institution, and it has the right to decide on any matter raised at the LPF Assembly.
The Federation members are not satisfied with the Pones style of leadership, and his approach to the Riodejaneiro Olympics, which were not able to give a Latvian record of the success of the Olympics by Alonas Ribakovs trainer Germana Jacubovski, is regarded as an unethical and disrespectful act by the President.
The days indicated that LPF members, as well as the Secretary-General of the Federation, Aivars Platonovs, have had a great impact on the development of the federal and sports type, but the Pons dose for the federation is not highly recognised.
The days spent working in the federation made it clear that the federation was my attempt to concentrate on power in one person’s hands.
The members of the Federation may also request amendments to the regulatory statutes governing the operation of LPF which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
The days explained that the discrepancy with the Pones work Federation had existed for a long time, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "last pillar" federation in order to decide what to do.
The former Vice-President of the Federation stated that during the Pones operation there was a significant reduction in the work of trainer and of the Court of Justice.
The days explained that, in order to ensure a faster process and decision-making in the federation, LPF members had decided at a meeting on the authorisation of the government consisting of Pone and two Vice-Presidents to lead the federation.
However, as Dzenis acknowledged, Pone joined the federation.
The federation's members believed in Pon, thinking that the federation would be able to make decisions more quickly.
"He won the trust of his fellows because he practically took power in his own hands to make an inevitable step," said Dzenis.
"This attitude cannot be from a person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," Dzenis admits.
A girl named Pone tried to satisfy her ambitions, which also makes her ill-fated as president of the LPF.
Long-term LPF Secretary-General Vladimir Maslovskis told the LETA that a letter could be submitted to the Federation next week until the LPF meeting should be reached within a month.
Of course, there is "all the questions that have been raised" at the meeting and it is necessary to decide on the next action.
On Friday it was not yet informed that LPF members are planning to call a meeting where they could decide to withdraw her from the office.
I don't know what to say about such a meeting, so I don't have a comment.
With regard to the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the already mentioned coach Jacubovski when there has been some dissatisfaction.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he filed a complaint at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovski lost the choice of the former trainer's office because his action did not suit LPF's interests," Pone said.
He also stressed that the LPF members' meetings, which were reported to have been carried out, have not so far been received.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved," said the LPF President.
Mr also explained that riodejaneiro Olympics should not be exploited, but also work.
Most people in Latvia are not clear and do not understand what the functions of the federation's presidents are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these areas, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that funding for the sport type federation is sufficient, as LPF receives only 10% of the necessary amounts.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international Federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"There has also been negotiations and I have worked to make Riga one of the world's stage in 2018," Pone said.
In 2015, LPF revenues totalled EUR 249 444, which is EUR 36,000 for minors over 2014.
About 40% of this amount had previously been developed, with an increase of around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
In addition, LPF received approximately 43% of its revenue or EUR 109 442 in the form of company, membership and other annual contributions.
In the form of bids and bids, the federation received another EUR 35 532.
After the federal expenditure compared with 2014, there was an increase of around EUR 70 000 in 2015, totalling EUR 263,876 in 2015.
The largest expenditure was not linked to the payment of money to persons, neither material expenditure nor wages - 215 733 Euros shown in the report as "other expenditure".
Money payments to persons amounted to EUR 20,549, while payments amounted to EUR 14,684.
If the federation had concluded a positive balance sheet in 2014, the LPF concluded a negative balance sheet in 2015.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) on the participation of LPF President Pone in the Riodejaneiro Olympic Games, on which the trainer of the Latvian footballer Ribakovs Jakubovskis has not yet been released.
Latvian nationals of Thailand have not been affected by the explosions in Thailand, according to the social website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM).
The Ministry has indicated that according to the information available in Thailand by the Latvian Goda Consul, Latvia has not been affected by the State-owned judgments.
Leta has already sent that AMA calls on passengers to monitor regularly the development of the political and security situation in the country and to ensure the safety of the place of residence, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia calls on the AMA to avoid people's places of employment, to be particularly careful and careful, to stay in public places and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers located in Thailand’s districts or planning to continue their journey are invited by the Ministry to contact tourism operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also calls on passengers to follow up regularly with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the safety of the place of residence.
There are high levels of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, the EM does not recommend that we move to the border between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces within the border between Thailand and Malaysia - in Patana, Jala, Narathiwata and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department's daily degurant by telephone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail paliziba@mfa.gov.lv.
The EMI also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad before the travel to buy a life and health insurance policy which also provides for repatriation in the case of sickness or death, as well as register in the Consular Register.
However, the masses will not be able to read Argentina's football.
However, after a short review of the football superstar Lionels Messi decided to return to the country of Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July, Argentina will choose the second year after a series of failed failed Copa Americana tournament finals, which will re-recognise Chile's transition.
Immediately after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would finish his career in the State, but then it was reported that he could return.
"I seriously consider the possibility of leaving the election, but my love for Argentina and the election is too large," said 29-year-old Messi.
The Spanish Great Barcelona attacker of the Messi national series will total 112 games win 55 words, which is the best indicator at all times.
Together with an adult election, the Messiah has not been a great success, although Argentina has still become the world's vice-president in 2014.
Meas are named five times as the world's best footballer.
For the Chinese Jenna and Jenna, they doubled Rio 20 km of walking distance.
On Friday, the Chinese racers Vans Jenn and Cai Zellins raced double-dubultuvar in 20 kilometers of Riodejaneiro Olympics.
The Olympic champion was coroned by Jens, who took the distance in 19 minutes and four seconds at the end of 12 seconds to hit Hellen.
On the other hand, Australian explorer Deins Bärds-Smits, who lost Jenna for 23 seconds, was fired.
The owners' favorite Kaju Bonfims improved Brazil's record, but he needed five seconds to climb to a good pasta.
Four years ago, Jean was awarded a bronze medal in London.
At the same distance, he also has two copper medals in world championships.
Júdo trainer Baskins: Níkiforenko is not a real weight.
Latvian Jewish trainer Olíeg Baskins was pleased to admit that Arturikaforenko Rio’s Olympics did not seem to have the courage to overcome the fiercest Azerbaijani athlete Usangi Kukauri.
There were no practical exceptions, only minimum if they were issued to be placed on a method or party.
We were already expecting it to happen.
He was prepared for right action, and he fought the right way, but the opposite was stronger.
On the contrary, it was well - known that Níkiforenko had fought them twice, and both Arthur lost.
But he's more serious.
Arturus is artificially transferred to the most severe weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been withdrawn, so Arthur used European quotas in the heavy weight category.
Arthur fought a 100 - pound [100 kg] weight fight against a Jew who had 140 kilograms and who has won several times in serious tournaments.
The heavy weight category is generally very low insensitivity moments.
If the smaller weight categories are in years of a different direction, then the severe is very rare.
On the question of whether it would be better to continue to fight one step in the easier weight category, Baskins replied with a responsive response.
I think it would be better for Arthur to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not really serious.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to relocate President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the Governing Body announced that "no time" for this year's withdrawal of the vote, which will take place at the forces until 2019, people on the streets of Karacas continued to wait for their appointed days as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear it because I saw the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deians, a 36-year-old office worker who was resting in the Altamira field on Wednesday.
The Altamira area located in the east of Karakasa was an ass-free epicenter protesting against the Maduro regime early in 2014.
However, now that the opposition has to make more pressure than ever before to achieve a referendum this year, people throughout the country are no longer displaying such energy.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons, non-participating protests," Deians said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but recognize that the Venetians are not so motivated.
The President of the Board of Appeal, Tibijes Lusena, commented that the government is interrupting the withdrawal process.
I will protest when opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
In addition to all the barriers that the government has been calling for to stop the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people out on the streets and protest.
More recently, the referendum initiative has had broad support - people have entered into the collection phase without experience in total.
However, when it comes to protesting against the government's efforts to block efforts, the number of entry on the coins is significantly lower.
"Some people focus on the development of food chains, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths in 2014,” said Cipriano Eredia, an opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that, until the next step in the referendum process - even more to gather signatures across the country - those who are against the socialist government will have to wait until October, she says that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove Venezuelan fear by letting them believe that this year's vote is practically impossible.
Under the Constitution, if a referendum was to be held in 2017, Maduro could be dismissed from office, but he would be allowed to name the next President.
If he has been released today, he has an obligation to make a general choice.
The Department of State of the United States will address this issue in its fourth post-day notice, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure compliance with Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The remaining steps for the implementation of the President's resignation referendum must be taken in a clear, concrete and immediate manner, thereby contributing to the rapid and effective solution to the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it was written.
Luis Salamak, a policy analyst who was a member of the Board of Governors for the period 2006 to 2009 that changes are not expected as soon as possible.
"I think this year's referendum will not be until social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government had violated the law, but they would have achieved their goal if people didn't protest.
The opposition called for a broad demonstration in September. Firstly in Karacas to ask for speeding up the process so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital on this day.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
On the other hand, Salamak believes that it is not possible to wait so long in this situation.
"They should respond to the Lusena statement faster and stronger, as it practically killed the referendum," said the expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admits that some opposition parties want to get to the demonstration to happen faster, but other groups want more time to organize.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signature campaign will have low activity," Salamak said.
In order to activate the reference process, it needs to be supported by twenty per cent of national voters, which is almost 4 million people.
Salamak and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal will take place in 2017, Cávismo will be visited.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government concludes its way to elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said FNL.
In time, LNSC Director A.Pučiti will be released.
On 12 August, at the extraordinary meeting of the New Council, the majority of Members supported the resignation of the Director of the New Sport Centre (LNSC), Ainara Pukíša, from the time of the performance of the duties during the service inspection.
In the near future, it is intended to clarify the conditions described in its submission by a sports visitor to the municipality.
Of course, the LNSC client suffered a headache during the visit of the trainer.
The event is called the New Sports Centre of the Grand Vest.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the possible appeal of the client to the court, the Commission was set up by Vice-President Vitas Volontes of the New Testament Council.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sports Centre and deliver an opinion by 16 August this year.
The next Tuesday it is planned to re-name the extraordinary sitting of the House to decide on further action.
It should be noted that during a particular accident, A.Puketis found himself on vacation.
The Executive Director of the Sports Centre shall be the Deputy Director of the Training of the Director of Oksana Grimaljuka-Nazarova from 5 days to 5 days in the service period.
Ogrès senior sports is a festival.
Today, Ogres New Sports Centre has held the Sports Festivals of Ogres pensioners.
At the senior stadium, the director of the new Sports Centre, Sanita Taurinja, who had prepared a special program for the members of the Sports Festival, was waiting for the new Ogres Sports Centre.
There will be no individual results to be evaluated at this time, but the participants will be divided into four teams.
"Every member invests in the result of the team," S.Turinja explains.
The participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball fast, Eifel Tower construction together with memory game, florbole activity staff, summer cover.
In order to successfully start all four Christmas programmes, participants had to carry out the tasks of engagement - "One round", "Rinča dance", "Espletnis", and three staphets - they had to come with horses, meet Frisby and Badminton elements.
All the assignments were prepared in an attractive way, and the participants in the sport did so with joy, laughter and pleasant comments, while others supported them.
It was particularly sensitive to the fact that summer was hidden, which resulted in the organizers' prepared meals.
The competitions followed with great interest the volunteers of the new Sports Centre, who conducted the tasks, fixed the results and did not interfere with the advice.
There was also the Ogres symbol Čiekur, who introduced members of the Sports Festival.
The elderly have proved to be very attractive, attractive, and well - suited for sports.
The Green Commander's representative Peter Zeps entered exactly eight times during one minute's round of bomb basketball, only one successful girl was left behind by his teammate Janis Staudžs.
The pensioners are active in the fire.
The bus was always full, and about 300 people entered the barracks.
"We meet twice a week in the Family Support Centre, where we can play a new table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioners Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the Sports Festival, all participants received a new Ogrès Sports Centre thanks for their participation, but the greatest benefit is to find out in the fresh air, a good attitude and a shared time.
For the 2016/2017 Premier, No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict item 14 (Note: it's not just Alana Smith's forecast, but our journalist's board as a whole)
Item 14 of the previous season
Results of winning the contract (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it was considered after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again be a struggle for pleasure or stagnation, depending on how 'tutsa is glass' in the far more pragmatic leadership of Tony Polisa.
But then Jeremy Pius sold 88% of his club's shares to Guočuana Lai and Pulas in arhetic safe hands, which the bookmekers immediately did for the first time as an undesirable first-lying manager.
The situation has inevitably changed - not only Hawthorns but also some of the north-west seas in Volverhampton, where new Chinese owners, while not wasting their time, rejected Kenya's Jacket services.
The police, however, confirmed that his work was not immediately threatened, and the employer has also expressed his desire not to change the club culture.
"I don't want to change the club's beliefs or start an inconsistency," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club for a long time.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we stay in the Premier and then go further, I would like to see the club stabilized at the top of the division.
I think it's the best deal in the world, and I would like to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulasa, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to go up to the top of the table, but to the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base, it will be important to expect rapid performance on the top of the table to know that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the essential work that other teams have recently invested in in the middle of the table.
In order to further develop the 14th place last season to be up, more work will certainly need to be done.
Only Aston Villa, located at the end of the table, starts a smaller gate, and it is worth remembering that in Christmas Albion the average made less than one side of the walls in 90 minutes, almost or twice the worst indicator of division.
They did not succeed in getting 13 of 38 games and play more than one games in nine games.
Of their 10 wins in no game won more than one game, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As already expected, a total of 34 doors were obtained from standard positions.
There is no wonder that the Hawthorns team was in a state of discontent, probably most likely after the shocking 0-0 at the end of January when the hotel team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams were better in protection - although no club has issued a list of four semi-protection centres.
These protections are often not sufficiently assessed, in particular, by John Evanss, who wants to go to Arsenal, taking into account their recent crisis in the case of selected players.
The international team in Northern Ireland had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion would come to spend most of its time selling.
Bens Foster's names are reliable and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Flechers, a large extent like Evansam, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play at high level at 32 years of age, and Klaudio Jacob has not been sufficiently assessed.
For all sides, it is disturbing that the story of the future of Saido Berahino is still not clear.
In writing the owner's order rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace have been rejected, but they remain peaceful and Mark Hüjz is ready to wait.
After the final season is close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved.
The shooter is certainly talented, but, as Paul has mentioned several times, they raise you on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has been seen for a long time that such relations are not working.
Albion argues that it is necessary to sign documents on the change before allowing the former English U-21 candidate to leave, but his 15 million-year-old tour with Diafru Saho took place some days before the takeover, claiming that he had passed a medical check and had reached an agreement on everything, but he had a weird feeling that he would be able to start the season.
This gives great pressure to the Venetian Solomon Rondon, who had looked very generous in the past season, but he needs to improve his nine-year-old supply, especially if Ricky Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anichebi and Stefan Seignon also appears in retrospectively.
Pulse in all its career is unfortunately famous with its slow new players moving up and down to three tiers - Jonathan Leko, Sema Fjilda and Taylor Roberts' performance last season in the last game with an undistributed 1-1 with Liverpool, almost or become normal.
He will return to those who have already been tested and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old half-year-old in total participated in five games in the previous season, becoming the first-born player in Premierli in 1999, which is also highly valued in the English Youth Football System.
Years Philips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only new player who participated at the end of the first week of competition.
This would not have been assured if the end could be quite accurate.
"All," Pulus last month said Express and Star about what would improve.
Any position you see.
We need to strengthen backgamut players, field middle players and players in previous positions.
The goals are, we know what we want.
They may appear much more difficult than expected, mainly because of a lack of clarity about the adoption process.
The season could determine how they started with seven highly winning games before the complex competitions with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At the same time, pressure on Pulis will become less or less persistent.
And who knows, maybe even Berehino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK is closer to the rescue business after the change in pensions of authorised aid
After Tata Steel UK pension authorities said that the scheme could be restructured without being in the pension protection fund (PPF) by increasing the company's view of closing the rescue transaction.
The British steel sector pension scheme is committed to 15 billion stars and, according to calculations, at least 700 million stars are missing, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of the rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks Vels.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the British business in which 11,000 people are employed, the future of negotiations with the Minister of Economy and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel sector pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the retired president, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well-financed in comparison with other schemes, with a deficit which has been reduced to 300 million stars for certain measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnston said that the authorities recognized that it was "not real" to the joint venture or any Tata Steel Uk buyer to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits gained from the scheme was much more binding than the addition of the PPF, which he added where workers should accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel's sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel companies, since March negotiations on its future of British business have been launched, and this has been a matter of belief in short negotiations with the British Government.
Kushik Kâterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more sustainable.
Speaking at the Tata Steel annual meeting in India, the Chamber said that the negotiations on pension schemes were moving forward, but he said that the scheme was well-financed.
"We speak with different stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government, etc." In Çaterje, the Times of India reported.
There is a view that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The authorised wish to cooperate in the negotiations on restructuring of the scheme will support Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include the conversion of the annual inflation-based increase of benefits from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as the reduction of future pension payments to the minimum laid down in the law.
Johnston adds: "The authorized and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the ability of the scheme to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the position of the scheme's financing has not affected the recent collapse of the securities market as well as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced of the ability of the scheme to provide benefits at the full level.
CBS commenter takes Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti for all the duration of the competition
On Thursday evening, the Canadian Radio Organisation CBC Olympics commented on the smoke caused by mixing Michael Felps with his competitor Rayen Lohti.
Eliot Frydmens both enjoyed all 200 meters of individual sailing during which Felps won his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Fredmens held them as Lohti, Felpsa's people and the old competitors at the top of the top of the world's top.
Fredman says, "He'll do it!"
Raiens Lochte won Michael Felps in this competition!
Felps could even go to a good pedagogical.
However, Felps won, but Lochte finished fourth.
As soon as Felps was on the gold floor, the CBS broadcasts were heard.
In the surprise of Friesman, he immediately admits his mistake.
I'm sorry, I missed the roads.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, who was widely assessed for errors, re-examined his own mistakes and apologized to the viewers on Twitter at the next hour after the event.
I'm all sorry.
I'll be surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.
Meanwhile, Felps survived a 2 168-year-old record as the largest Olympic winner ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonida from Rhodes, who in ancient Olympics had more Olympic title than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the former NATO commander's computer.
The hackers published the list and data on one of Soros' funds.
The same hackers who may have been carrying out an attack on US Democratic Party e-mails and published their lists may also be accused of new attacks in the series of attacks, reports the agency "Bloomberg".
Following the information received, these Cypriots have launched an attack on the former NATO Commander General Bridlov's list of strengths and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of millions of projects supported by George Soros.

The news agency claims that it is about the same hackers who carried out an attack on U.S. Democratic Party computers and led by the Russian Specialist.
The U.S. Exploratory Day has already warned the Congress' high officials about possible hackers' attacks on the Democratic Party.
The news agency "Reuters" reports that it has information that experts reported several policies once again - the cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian observers or their controlled organisations.
However, Congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to cyberattack victims because it was secret.
The scandal of attacks against the Democratic Party's computers began after some 20,000 e-mails were posted online by the party's representatives during the presidential campaign.
The party's candidate Hilaria Clinton announced that these letters were being broadcast by Russian specialists.
The Russian President's secretary, Dmitry Peskovs, said that Russia had no contact with cyberterrorists.

Dinneland has come to the audience with information on its long-planned status structure, consisting of a transport bag and a new passenger stop at the eastern part of the park.
The project, located in the east of the attractive 5 Freeway park, includes 6,800 accommodation structures and transport bags where buses, road buses, taxi meters and other vehicles can take visitors to the park.
The entrance to the port is connected to the rest of the park with the structure of the apartment and the transport bag.
This structure, up to the planned 14-acre extension project, is part of a $1 billion project for the promised investment in the city of Anaheim against 30 years' exemption from the waste tax.
The construction of the project, which is synchronized with the Eastern Walls, will be launched next year.
The structure of the farm will be built above the station of Publas of the Dinneja currency, which has approximately 1,300 places.
The volume of transport will replace the commercial capacity of the discount park purchased in 2014.
The project is intended to be opened in 2018.

In order to heat a house, two thirds of its inhabitants will have to agree.
If the owners of the apartment are very expensive and specifically talked about what the building is in a technical position, if such a possibility is to receive support and build it in any way possible, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing will be possible from this year for any multi-stakeholder home, only the condition is that the building phase must be put in place.
In the past, it was only possible to use a home of many different kinds of animals.
The most important event for house managers is by providing the organization of meetings for the owners of the apartment.
An important problem where this process is currently under way is that 67% of the owners of the apartment are required.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The management of Liepaja's house" (LNA) project manager Tom Cirulis.
"Of course it is very difficult to ensure it because in most of the congregations the number of owners of such apartments does not fall apart," says Gints Ločmelis, head of the company's project "Home Service APSE".
The largest house managers in Liepa - "Nam Service APSE" and LNA, which serves about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-living homes by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that, at the start of the work, it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovations, but the treatment of the citizens of each project should be improved.
I also needed some bank credit, 76% of the household population.

She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm house.
Well, it can't be that one side thinks, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agree on the whole measure," says Janis.
This provision has been amended by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that 51% of the votes in banks are unable to reach the necessary funding, which has also been experienced during the past programming period.
In most cases, a commercial bank needs two-thirds of the owner's certificate.
As one of the recommendations for house managers, the Head of the European Union Fund Division of the Ministry of Economics, Anda Lagzdin, has been able to introduce people with existing examples and various benefits, such as energy savings, by renovating buildings.

The detention operation of the potential suicide bomber in Canada was honorable.
All started when the Canadian police received the revised video entry from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police have received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
Among other things, it contained a video entry called "mousecle" that was written by an unknown person who was clearly present at the final stage of the attack.
"And he was going to do it with a real shot," said Vice-President of the Canadian Police, Mike Kabana.
In the video, a black masked man in English and Arabic spoke threats to the Canadians and promised to get rid of all they had done to Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition programs, the Canadian police have been able to recognize this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Drivers.
He was already in charge of monitoring the probation service on the promotion of the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The Court ruled that Driveram was prohibited from further doing so and also from participating in any radical organisation.
However, until then the authorities did not consider that the Drivers could cause any physical danger to their surroundings.
When the police arrived at her home in the city of Strattoria in Ontario, the young man came out and sat on a taxi.
At that time, the guards tried to arrest him, but the driver, sitting on the back seat, had an impact on the speaker.
To prevent the detonation of the second bomber, the police set up a new man.
He's dead from the trauma.
The driver of the cabometer is not suffering.
In a Canadian television interview, the father of a non-intralized terrorist named Wayne Dravers said his son had turned to Islam in his early teens.
This helped him at first to quit drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a troubled teenager who had long been no part of the world because of his mother’s death.
It's just that when I told you today that I liked this video, I was wondering how far he'd gone.
I didn't feel that he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he was so good at speaking Arabic," said Aaron's father.
The Canadian police recognize - if they had entered a few hours later, the development of events could have been quite different.
Radévica to Rio will be a tourist and will support Latvia's facilities.
The former Olympics and the ease with Ineta Raděvica LTV in the Olympics said that the five-day performance of seven athletes, Laura Ikanices-Admidiñas, was not bad in the first two disciplines, given that the athlete was traumatized.
On the other hand, Laura’s recovery was done with a good foot rather than with a left foot.
Radévic said that it is comparable - just like a person who has been able to write with a good hand would suddenly be forced to write with a left hand.
Therefore, the outcome of Ikunice-Admidinas in view of the trauma is not bad.
Radévica discovered that she had not been contacted by Ikunieci-Admidiño in time, but actively followed her on her own and felt with her.
Ineta learned about Laura’s recent trauma and gave support to the sports team, stating that the retreat did not begin to build its own security but showed character and time of battle.
In other forms of sport, Radjevica considers that the Olympics are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is to transfer him to Rio as a tourist is not correct.
She recalled that even on her first trip to the Olympics, where she had moved to 13 places, she was called a tourist, causing negative emotions.
Ineta remembers her beginnings, not just Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," said Radjevic, recalling his experience in sports.
She told me that it was always important to have someone in the tribunal who would give the same energy.
Even Radjevica will be a tourist this year - she will go to Riodejaneiro next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that it will definitely lead to the easy-to-read competition.
Ineta Radévica won the European Championship in 2010.
In 2004, she took 13 seats in the Olympic Games in Athens and 20 positions in the trisolate but did not start in 2008 because she was expecting her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radjevic was on the 4th floor.
The walls will show the film "Quanta Code" with physical Kascheev's main role.
The film's annotation says that the parallel of electronics is a dreamer, a teacher, a socially active and civil-thinking man and a father who is looking for contact with Vistvaren.
In the case of Latvian Television, "Rita Panoráma" pointed out that he had an interesting experience.
I learned about how to top movies, how to film them, how to record the sound.
"And really great work," said the physicist.
He admits that the film's been over for two years.
The biggest difference with the director was the name of the film.
I'm categorically against this name.
No quota code.
"There is no secret which can be known and is all clear by filming," added the LU Associated Professor.
Kaščejevs acknowledges that he likes the fact that the film is going to live right on Muryan's free movie tonight.
They are organised by friends from the Viegli Foundation, and these cinema sessions will take place every evening until 9 September.
Four people were injured in bomb explosions at tourist sites in Thailand
After the people of Thailand voted in favour of the adoption of the military-supported Constitution, on Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in the destinations of popular tourism - a series of bombings, which took place in four and many people were injured.
The first two rounds are huge sea resorts in Huahin on Thursday evening, next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that in the first case, a woman of one ethnic background was injured and 20 people were injured, 10 of whom were aliens.
The authorities have confirmed that other judgments have taken place in the cities of Phuket, Tran and Suratthan in the south.
Two bombs exploded in Phücket's town of Patong and two other in Phann Province - in the tourist region north of Phücket.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bombs exploded in Thailand.
On Friday, the Italian Royal Police Officer, Cristina Patanačarones, announced that the solution was not linked to Islamic extremists and is considered to be local sabotaging acts.
"There is still too much to make conclusions," he said.
"But we are absolutely sure that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, that is actually a local level of substantiation, and we are trying to find guilty persons."
On 12 August 2016, after a small explosion of power bombers in Huahin, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in the series of bombings carried out in important areas of the tourism sector in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country as a result of which terrorists can be found in the country.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet to take responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have not charged any special group, but the resolution took place on the same week when the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phüketa and Phanna - rejected the referendum supported by the militaryists, and in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the people are Muslims, since the fall of 2004, more than 6500 people have been injured.
The event took place on the day of the birth of the queen of Thailand, Syria, which is the day of the national festival in Thailand.
The town of Klai Kangwon is located in Huahin or "the city far from the races", where the royal family of Thailand often lives.
King Bumbols Aduljade was the longest monarch in the world.
NAME: Mängel’s former drug dealer.
Social networks report that some of the drug addicts have become pregnant.
Let's help you find it!
Please help!!!
On August 12, Ogres No. has been hit by a tractor-medicine diver Macculloch M200-117T!
"If its location is known or there is any other information, please call - 29486175" by the victim.
Porgis and Besa - as we have already benefited!
There's a lot of operas that haven't ever been skimmed in Latvia.
There's something very rare.
However, it seems strange that since the past 17 centuries, George Gäršvin's opus Porgias and Besa has not been studied or studied, nor has it been agreed, if it does not consider the chrestomatic solo number of Summertime periodicals on sights (including the Ines Galantes summer festival), some of the students' projects, showing and similar.
That is why - since Latvia is a civilized Western country, it is bound by the rules and copyrights of the Gäršvin family, which apply to Portugal and Bessus by 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, by completing the study, the author wanted all 14 soloists to be blackmen.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of the U.S. operation in the field of race are not known and the wish of the composer would be difficult.
On 6 August, the concert created by the compromise with four artists' black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters' support was released on the 10th of August, in the wake of the Cés art festival, reminiscent of Gäršvina’s beautiful song, in which its traditional European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gospels, the early 20th century fashions, and the remaining hits, telling of the bitter love stories of the Katfišrovs Corps of Portugal and the late spring Besa in a musical quality that would have benefited from documenting life stories.
First of all, because of LNSO and Lieutenant Andre Pogas.
On the very complex venue for the spacious outdoor concert in the city park of Césu, the orchestra is located near the view of the audience of the soloist and vocalist (and great fun!) race, when the joint scan was stylisticly nazanized, rich and precise both metal and piano parts (Mārtínš Zilberts).
Second, they'll be fine for the team.
The charismatic dramaist Baritone Lester Linčs (Porgijs) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire is both Baritone and Basbariton parties, especially in the Wardi operas.
Portugal has played an countless role, including Kraunu - he felt like a fish in the water in this operation and also inspired audience partners even in concert to raise the emotional atmosphere of the solidarity of the poor people.
In its second Portuguese and Besa concert hall (the first one in 2012 was not more than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retlu) was discovered as a vitally plastic combination of different vocal styles with dramatic toneed temple and fantastic piano.
Not yet, she's one of the most brightest of modern Aids.
For the attractive beginner of Jamaican origin, Germein Smith, who was once interested in Boston’s study of Andris Poga, the drug dealer Sportsinlaifa is a company’s role in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his skills in playing and singing as a well-trained music actor.
Smits are one of the rarely occurring cleaners in which the voice seems to still conceal unopened German possibilities as before 15 years ago when the opera voice has not been found, fighting to calm the young.
It is unlikely that even from row 24 and relatively dark Jerome Smith’s speech allows her to stir up a mixture of soft powder in her hands even if it is not there at least.
How can we avoid such a mephisticophile cardiologist, who in an empty place is being deceived by the illusion of miraculous life in New York?
The crown’s role was represented by the temple’s dunes surrounded by Rodney Clarks.
The greatest vocal surprise in the Latvian series of soloists in the Cēss was Sonoras Vaices, represented by Sirina - a fast top record, a wise balance between the spoken and sung text, in accordance with the change in voice position, a German acrobatics and dramatism complemented by both the Syrian poet My Man is Gone Now and the slytified president in the broad prayer of Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margaritas Wilson was well played in the class, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning of the year caused quite a stir about the noise and nervousness of his real character by acquiring the reprises.
The colors and colors were derived from the lots entrusted to Mihailam Čulpējeva, Riharad Mačanovski, Andrim Lapinas (particularly on the city wall, the Krabjes seller is responsible for the sopraan test).
Ilonas Bageles, Riharda Millera, Emila Kivleneke, as well as in the talks where Ivo Martinson, represented by a researcher and a white lawyer in the art of Arčdeil, was unexpectedly presented to viewers by the director and actor Juris Žagars of the Cés Festival.
In the local concept of concerts created by Histura Kairiša, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mainly in the proscenia, rarely coming up or going along the stairs.
The small commission situation in the dynamic process made us narrow maps in the hands of Latvian runners.
Its presence is an all-prosessional explanation.
First, some promisers played several episodes (which sometimes made it difficult to follow their audience identity).
Second, there is a lot of dialogue in Portugal and Besa to discuss phrases, an answer that will be easier to follow in front of the events.
The listening ear was greatly helped by a titanium machine in the noses of the opera.
The conditions were deteriorating and the first part of the concert was very long.
However, this did not stop most of the audience from leaving until the end to raise artists.
Nine evenings are also quite different from the start of a full-time operation, especially if it is expected to take a longer journey from Jerusalem, however, the opera Porgis and Besa has returned to the musical area of Latvia and will probably become one of the most exciting musical experiences of this summer.
Also in Liepa, where it emerged last night and in all other acoustic conditions.
In the Riga game field, the man was afraid of the children with his fist.
On the evening of 11 August, at about eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received information from a checked - out child’s parents, who were shocked that there was a man in the city of Lomonosova who had a fear of children.
The law guards immediately responded to the name and address of the event, where they also met this man with a scar, who at the time had a very large amount of alcohol - 3.07 prom.
It was found that in 1962, a man who was born deaf had already feared that his children would not be able to cry.
This time, however, for the child’s training, an aggressive man used a knife to place a child’s equipment on the floor.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the incident, a criminal process has begun to interfere with the public order of disturbances which are manifestly incorrigible against society or indiscriminately ignoring the general standards of conduct and disturbing human peace.
Such offences shall be punished by the withdrawal of liberty for up to two years or by the withdrawal of temporary liberty or by forced labour or by the punishment of money and by the monitoring of probation for up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditations in Olympic games.
The presidents of sports-type federations usually arrive at the Olympic Games venue for a few days and use guest accreditations that may change their names, so during their competitions there are several owners, LETA told the agency, representative of the Latvian Olympics Unit (LOV).
On the third day, a wide range of complaints were raised after the words of the training coach Alonas Ribakova, German Jakubovsk, who revealed that the last time the trainer had decided to go to the Riodejaneiro Olympics, the leader of the Latvian Federation of Pelegings (LPF), Kaspars Pone, while the trainer had to stay home.
Later it became known that Pone came out of Brazil with a trainer's accreditation, which the president himself expressed surprise because "now there is no place inside".
As told by Wilcina, the leader of the Latvian Vieglatlätic Union (LVS), Guntis Zálitis, was only two presidents of the London Olympic Games.
The Olympic theme includes sportsmen and officials, including trainers, doctors, delegation administration.
In addition, it is likely that in London, the trainer's accreditation was also granted.
"The other presidents of the federation are coming in as guests, and they have their accreditations changing - coming in a few days and then using someone else," said Wilcina, explaining that the presidents of this federation are not living in the Olympics.
Mr. Riodejaneiro has already arrived at the end of July and will leave Brazil on August 13th, so he will probably be there most longer than all the presidents of the national federations.
It is clear that Latvia’s abandoned flight started only one day on August 10th.
Latvia's Riodejaneiro Olympic Games will be represented in 11 sports, and the Agency's LETA estimates show that six or seven federations will run for the most important four-year competitions.
The medicine will appear in Brazil on the sixth day, the President of the Latvian Rite-Federation Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be at the BMX events scheduled for next week, the President of the Latvian Windsørfing Federation Ansis Dále on Riodejaneiro has planned to fly on 16 August when Ketija Birzule is already finished, but the President of the Latvian Cina Federation Dintars Urbantik - the day before.
Also, the next week, the President of the Latvian Association for Education, Charles Kräsliņš, was planning to join, when the beginning of this campaign for Dani Opelnik is already over.
The Latvian President Raymonds Rublovskis at least did not find Riodejaneiro during the Latvian sports competition, although his entry had been planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation is not currently president, but the Latvian sports company is still in conflict and its sportsmen are invited by the Latvian Olympic Committee to international sports.
As soon as the President of the Latvian Voljbola Federation Atis Sausnitis and the leader of the Latvian Tennis Union, Juris Savickis decided not to take part in Riodejaneiro.
Vasiljevs evaluates the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world-class Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, scriptographer, author of books, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasiljevs is very often visiting Latvia during the past years.
He recently evaluated the competitors at the end of "Mis and Mysters Latvia 2016" and acknowledged that Latvia's role is different from that of Russia's gender representatives with natural breasts and lips which are not improved by silicon and botulin injections.
In his interview with "Vakar News", Alexander Vasiljevs said that for years he has been the president of the jury in the popular "Wes Russia" beautiful competition.
That is why he was also very interested in the evaluation of "Mis and Mysters Latvia 2016".
In calling for differences in Latvian beauty competition standards from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilijevs stressed that Latvia and Russians have a very different idea: "Russia beauty contestants are more closely different from Latvian competitors."
However, young Latvians are beautifully dressed and refreshed, and can also be impressed by the natural beauty, not by the miracles performed by plastic surgery.
This is why I particularly congratulate the Latvian beauty contestants on their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasilijeva has great plans.
The exhibition of the collection of fashion historians "The Added Nature" is currently seen in the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, in the city of Livonia's order, the Vasiljeva exhibition "Cazu Tours 1860-2010".
Vasiljev was so impressed by Ventspili that he enjoyed the city’s hospitality for a few days and had a meal along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, there is a real paradise in here.
"In Latvia to spend time and rest is pure fun," said the fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November Aleksandr Vasiljevs will discover a private fashion museum.
Please help!
Please call our son, brother, for the treatment of the baby.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the wonderful people around us and to God that they have created an opportunity to save Rinalda, but, unfortunately, it is not now completely possible to afford medical costs.
Rinalds Grinbergs is 11 years old, where at the end of July he diagnosed brain tumors.
This year he graduated from the 4th class at the University of Milzkalnes with great skill, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
It's like he's been given everything.
A healthy, viable, undeterred, eager and active child.
It's always soft and slow.
On July 26, our family will be remembered forever.
During the last few weeks, he suffered from maladies, headaches, but his doctor took him to the liver virus.
And I started by saying that it is.
Because someone could have thought that such "unlucky" symptoms of sin are much more serious than the mind is beyond comprehension.
On July 26, we received diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
The liquid is rapidly stored in the brain, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to carry out an operation to stimulate remaining fluid because the plant is not actually available for surgery.
It cannot be determined whether the plant is good or bad.
The next national payment plan: start shooting and see what's going on.
We're going to experiment with it, we're going to learn the results.
The success of Rinalda's research has enabled her to show her doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.
He took an operation and showed that he had to operate immediately.
The plant produces a large pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the plant is good or bad to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not surprisingly, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, Rinalds was in Spain with his mother Eviu on August 8 and was operated on August 9.
A very difficult operation was performed over 6 hours.
The surgery took place at the Santa Elena clinic.
It has been accomplished to remove most crops, reduce the pressure, get samples of analysis.
Rinalds is already on the way from bed and as a regular teenager, he asks for free cartons in the evenings.
The results of oncological analyses should now be expected.
Thank the doctor for Aragez and the clinical management, who understood the situation and operated immediately without receiving full treatment before surgery.
They were confident that the amount would be paid in the remainder, only EUR 10,000 was required for the first contribution to operate and save Rinalda's life.
The 6 000 euro was paid to parents by selling techniques, but the other amount needed for travel expenses, for living, hospital first contribution paid by relatives and friends.
However, at least EUR 24,000 is still needed for the first stage of treatment in Spain and for the money we have borrowed from the first contribution.
Please help us pay this, so important surgery for Rinalda's health.
Each euro is important in order to help meet the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue treatment successfully.
The signs of Nemeri in Ukraine raise the question: What is Vladimir Putin's advice?
We have been able to discuss the truth of these claims.
Ukraine prohibits them, while the US and the European Union state that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open-ended Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has detected some signs of six-day shock, but very little to stop Moscow's major plans.
Russia is known for its distortion of events or for its misinterpretation for political purposes, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
During the past year, members of the opposition forces of Ukraine have destroyed electricity from the Crimea, and some of them have also been involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea remains a topical issue, although there is little basis for suspicion that the Government of Ukraine would sponsor a scenario of such events.
In order to do so, an open-source analysis shows that Russia has continued to increase its military presence since at least six days ago - before an attack is expected.
It shows how heavy weapons are transported by sides, including coastal missile systems.
Indistinctly known Russian escalation
Some reports show that Russia’s forces had already planned a rotation that could help clarify activities, although it would be very secret that it had just been expected to take place in one of the most complete periods since the accession in 2014.
In order to be known at the end of the week, Mr Putina has no doubt in his statement that he will be more focused on Ukraine by choosing to use this episode so that as real as it is for a larger purpose.
Analytics point to disturbing parallels with how Russia remained just before previous military operations against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers were provided to prevent the members of the Crimas voluntary opposition forces from taking a side that was still under control of Ukraine only to discover that they were indeed the Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists did not take part in East Ukraine, Putins put his forces across the border, warning that they might be necessary for the "protection" of Russian ethnic civilians in Ukraine, which he says is being attacked.
He organized an aid convoy into a region that, according to NATO information, was only a barrier to Russia's invasion.
What are Mr Putin's plans to do in Crimea?
Some made comments whether Moscow alone did not plan another military intervention.
The war in East Ukraine has been on its way, just as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seems to be the point in this parallel when it is intended to introduce fear from military action rather than from actual action - it will bring Putin short-term relations with Ukraine and the Western countries.
Marks Galeoti, professor at the University of New York, who studied Russia, pointed out that Crime would be of little importance as a point from which military action against East Ukraine, which is limited to part of Russia, is better protected than Crime, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very little chance if Russians really plan a great degree of offensive," said Mr. Galeoti.
Sooner "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
International peace talks on Ukraine, which was once a mechanism with Putin to force contacts with Western leaders who ignored him for the sake of the Crimea anecdotes, are increasingly viewed as ineffective and unnecessary.
By stressing that there is a threat that a conflict can be rescinded, Putins gives new power to negotiations: perhaps his absence from the endless tears.
"That's the standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to start from a strong position," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted, I could do anything more, much worse." "
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that it was not important for the parties to continue negotiations during the Crimean occupation to convince them to return to the negotiating table and go to the centre of the process.
What does it really give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen as a world power, although its economic size is lower than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as the one who has the right to veto with respect to Ukraine's sovereignty, to a certain extent maintaining the country under Russia's control.
This can also be good for Putin long-term long-term long-term expectations for a wide-ranging agreement with the United States that would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with the conditions favourable to Moscow, of course - even ending Western sanctions against Russia.
A few houses on this target since the fall in the state economy in 2014, have been voiced several times, mainly because of a reduction in national oil and gas export value.
Since the attack in Syria last Friday, he has repeatedly called for the powers of the West to join him in a great coalition against extremists.
However, Russia's leaders may consider it necessary to provide such an agreement before the end of the term of office of President Obama.
On the basis of the Russian authorities, the next President will be Hilaria Clinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donalds J. Tramps, although highly friendly against Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
On the other hand, Obama is considered to be one who "searches for solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So it's possible to close the door so that something is done fast.
Even if it is not possible to reach a broad agreement, it seems that Putin is satisfied with Russia's weak neighbour to say what will be next.
In the original version of this letter, the year Russia discovered Crime from Ukraine was wrong.
This occurred in 2014 and not in 2013.
At the convention on the road, the White House directed its means to fight the Zika virus
The Obama Administration said on Thursday that it would move $81 million from biomedicine research and anti-emergency and health care programmes to pay for vaccines against the development of the Zika virus in response to emergency measures, as Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
In her letter to the Congress, Ms Metjūsa Barvela , Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that without the resources allocated, the National Institute for Health and Biomedical Research and Development would remain free of money for the fight against skin disease until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be possible to stop the development of the vaccine at an important time, by increasing the number of cases of Zika disease in the country.
Last week 7,350 cases of Zika virus were recorded in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (in accordance with data from the Disease Control and Prevention Centre).
Ms. Barvelas said that 15 babies were born with birth defects related to Zika virus.
The virus may cause brain development anomalies and other serious defects in pregnant mothers.
The prevalence of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased political rates of federal government response.
Hilaria Clintone stopped during the campaign on the second day in Vainvud, Maiami's family, where there was a significant local incidence of Zika virus outbreaks, and forced Congress to return from its five-week suspension to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been in a controversial position on the issue of Zika virus for the most part of the year.
In February Obama requested emergency funding of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans suspended it by calling for a more detailed account of what money will be spent.
For months, legislators have been fighting over how much money should be given and how much it should be spent.
Last month, democracy blocked the review of the measures offered by the Republicans when $1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against the Zika virus , but included conditions that would prevent the allocation of funds for family planning to ensure the means of contraceptives in relation to the virus that can be transmitted on a gender-based basis.
In April, the White House was forced to move $589 million from the United States to the fight against Ebola virus, to the fight against Zika virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used inside the country.
On the fourth day, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of its money and that it would be spent by the end of August.
"It is impossible to decide on emergency funding for the fight against the Zika virus that the administration has been allowed to choose between the withdrawal of important vaccine development work and the placing of bodies in other valuable national programmes in order to avoid it temporarily," Barvela wrote.
Democrats have made this announcement to transfer to the Republicans additional non-expenditure for the fight against the Zika virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Ninsija Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, called on representatives of Paul D. Raien, the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the continuation of this measure.
"All possibilities have been lost, and now we are addressing the National Health Institute," said Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr Rayna's advisers said that the transfer of funds was a step that had to be taken in the past and that Obama's administration had chosen to express the maximum political advantage from the problem of Zika virus.
Last week the National Health Institute announced that vaccines have begun clinical trials against Zika virus with 80 people, and hopes to launch the second phase "In the countries of the Zika virus epidemic" in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, the study of additional funding will cease without any immediate delay.
Barvela said she would be directed to the fight against the Zika virus at $34 million from the National Health Service for the search for medicines to treat other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be relisted for the Biomedicine Advanced Research and Development Authority, which will support the development of medicines and vaccines by responding to emergencies in the field of public health.
This money will come from several accounts, including 19 million US dollars from a programme providing fuel for low-suspended families and 4 million US dollars from material dependency programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even then, as Barvela said, additional money will only be enough in the next month when agencies are going to "mainly speed up their action" in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress does not take action.
In the last four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent $60 million in order to help countries protect pregnant women, $25 million in order to strengthen their preparedness for Zika virus and plans to fight it, and $16 million in order to help it develop data acquisition systems to quickly identify microcephaly and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thailand’s leader links attacks on tourist destinations with constitutional changes
On Friday, Thailand's dog leader called on the public to be patient until researchers discovered that a series of fatal bombings took place in Thailand last week.
General Prajuts Çan-oča, the dog leader and Prime Minister said that criminals had been "bad people" protesting against the new Constitution which the voters approved on Sunday in the referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said to the people.
Bomb bombings took place in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, between the tourist destinations, four people were killed and thousands were killed.
The authorities state that fire attacks in another country are related.
Analysts claim that the aim of the bomb explosion was not to kill many people but also to damage the tourism sector, one of the highlights of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"For any reason, explosions and firefighters attack the dog's claim that the post-reference situation will be stable," said Sunaj Fasuks, the oldest researcher in the Human Rights Watch organization.
These attacks have led to the discrediting effects of power institutions, terrorizing society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thai rescue services personnel are taking care of the bomb explosion in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these judgments are not related to international terrorism or prolonged Islamist amnesty in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local satellites of nature" rather than terrorism.
A strong political symbol for the time and place of the chosen attack.
On Friday, when the people were ready to celebrate the birth of the king of Syria, which is thought to be the Day of Judgment in Thailand.
Four explosions took place in the city of Huahin, about 125 Jews from Bangkok, where the majority were also injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the impact of political parties and give the military greater powers even if the government is again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Murey Hiberts, South-East Asia expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed to the suspicions of the militaryists that the attacks were being carried out by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The results were "precisely coordinated, but apparently intended for the creation of fear and confusion, not for mass damage and damage and injuries," he said.
Last year, 20 people were killed in the explosion at the popular Erevan shrine in Bangkok, China’s largest tourist.
The Thai authorities linked explosives to warheads that were not satisfied with more than 100 eggs returning to China.
General Preijuts, who has been leading the hunt since 2014, when civil government has been replaced, said that this week's divorce "pains the hearts of farmers."
Why now that the state is better when the economy is better and the tourism sector is better?" he said.
We need to ask why and what did it do.
Golden Reaction: How the Historical Miracle of Simone Manuela
This morning when I start fighting, I will try to remove the weight of the black community from my shoulders, which is something that I carry with me simply in such a position.
But I hope that's all going to be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others for training and, hopefully, different forms of this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we are more, and it's not Simone, the blacksmith, because the blacksmith's mark makes it look like I shouldn't be able to cut gold medals or that I shouldn't be able to skip records.
It's not because I'm working as hard as everybody else, and I love sports and I want to win like everybody else.
Competition for students - lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) - protection in Colombia
Two years ago, 16 years ago, 16 - year - old Sergio Urrego moved away from the shopping center in Bogoto, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, reading the song "Goodby Cruel World" ("Ardiev's evil world").
His death was the first of the protests that took place in Colombia this week, where the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the wider political conflicts that divided the country into two camps.
After her death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes , filed a court complaint against school officials accusing them of shutting down her only son when it was discovered that she and her classmates had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia announced a favorable judgment calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to avoid discrimination.
The decision was part of the legal victory of the Colombian geys rights movement, which led to the adoption of a decision on the legalization of equality of marriage this year.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle in their fight for equality because Gina Peradija, the Minister of Education, who is open to gays, became a scandal for applying this provision to the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to traffic sexually exposed content from the pornography magazine, spreading to people that it was part of the literature published by the Ministry of Education.
The Perdija did it with a mask.
Although the Ministry offered school assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in order to help them focus on the rule, it did not try to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is a tool for resolving conflicts," said Mrs. Perdodia in the interview on Thursday.
The discussions began before the national debate on the future in a country where peace negotiations between the Government and the revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or the FARC will be settled.
The coalition of politicians in opposition to the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church have been mobilized very quickly by accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting a gender union and gender change.
In order to make it more difficult for all, the government delegation participating in the talks with the FARC in Havana recently reached a gender agreement and the equality of L.G.B.T. with which the government is invited to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace talks, which took 42 years to old Perdija, the Colombian policy for the emerging star.
They have suddenly demonstrated a bunch of posters and some have also threatened to resort to violence against them and their partners, Sesilia Alvaresa-Korea Glena, former trade ministers.
The debate lasted a whole week, trying to correct the mistake and to reopen the debate with constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand up and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who are just going to find out," she said.
This is a very complicated field of work and a very unique time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the deal with FARC, which would be a point of reference for the earthquake in the country, they need to consider the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is the peaceable state the one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it the one in which everyone has the same opportunity?" she asked.
Although she was not pleased with the purpose of forgiveness and transfer this week, she is glad that today in Colombia, gay students can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers someday.
"I am very important that they are peaceful and realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perdia.
We can't expect a new suicide to start to change something.
Keep your vote in cybersynchronous - The New York Times
"The ASV is looking for ways to keep hackers together from the polling of urine" (letter of knowledge, August 4th)
Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. George Johnson, says that the Obama administration is thinking of the additional protection of security of the system of national elections.
These changes may be necessary and need to be considered immediately.
In various expressions and recent disclosures of the fact that foreign forces, perhaps national countries, are increasingly interested in the impact of our elections, requires the federal government to pay additional attention to ensuring our elections and perhaps consider them part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact the thousands of national jurisdictions that help to make elections and offer assistance, consultation and management of the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diversity and diversity of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process must begin as soon as possible.
The writer, a democracy from Mississippi, is a member of the High Military National Security Committee.
In Pennsylvania, a son injured in a car accident, a third case has already occurred in the parks this week
On the fourth day, hiding from the wheelchair, a son was found and taken to the Pittsburgh hospital. A quick relief service and park officials say this is already the third accident this week in the USA's amusement park where the child suffered.
A child whose name is not disclosed was transferred to a child hospital in Pittsburgh, about 50 miles (80 km) east of the Aidlwail and Soukzona Attraction Park in Laidžonjär, Pennsylvania, said the representative of the quick relief services in the Westmurland region.
Three-year-old son, who had been visiting with his brother while he was being helped on site, was informed by the e-mail of the park's representative, Jeff Krushtors.
The Krushurs said that the "Rollo Coaster" reference to the event will be closed during the investigation.
In the case of adult children, at least 3 feet (91 cm) in length must be able to see the carousel and those who are shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be in adult care.
The extract, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the Department of Agriculture of the State indicated that it was checked in August.
The representative of the hospital shall comment on the child’s health situation in his or her refusal.
On Christmas Eve, a 10 - year - old son died from the world’s highest water volcano in Kansas, Kansas.
Three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls who fell from more than 30 feet (9 m) in the hospital on the first day of the hospital were reported by local media during the day of the change in the current rate during the annual market in Grinville, Tennessee.
Japan's Prime Minister Abe World War II will not visit a shrine where the memory of war is approved:
The news agency Jiji reports that Japan's Prime Minister Sindzo Abe Japan's crimes will not be visited during World War II during the year of the battle of Tokyo, which marks the anniversary of the war.
On Thursday Iji reported, however, that Abe was planning on sending Jasukani a ritual gift for a year.
The festival also welcomes the memory of 14 Japanese caravans who are judged to be war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of Japanese royal militaryism.
Both have not visited the shrine since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited it to show respect for those who die of his birth.
New Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that this is a matter of conscience.
Inada - close to Abe, a supporter of the amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution - visited Yasukani regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyado reports that Minister Masihiro Imamura visited the shrine on Thursday and said that prayers for peace and prosperity in Japan had been made.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become more and more complex after the growing protection of China's coast and the existence of other national vessels near the disputed islands of South-West China, which are known in Japan as Senkaku, but in China about Diaoudz.
Detained two suspects in the planning of Rio Olympic terrorist acts: police
On Thursday, the police arrested two people suspected of belonging to the Islamic State's support for the group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Riodejaneiro.
The operation police had already arrested 12 persons before the fourth day, all suspected of cooperation with Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were understood and subsequently released.
The two-quarters are Brazilian, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although Brazil’s history has not been in conflict with known groups of combatants, the Government reports that the Olympic Games have made the state a more recent goal, especially because the games will be part of countries fighting against the Islamic State.
They control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has launched air attacks on them.
The group has supporters around the world who have been subjected to harassment and exploitation by civilians.
An official complaint against the newly suspected French priest
In the past month's investigation of the hypocrisy of the French priest against the man who was arrested earlier, official charges were filed, and on Friday Reuters reported the source of information to the police.
In his 21-year-old suspects, research on cooperation with terrorists has been carried out and he has planned attacks on people, the source of the information mentioned.
The man was telephoned by Adele Kermić and Abdeu Malik Petitján, who interrupted church service at Stettejen du Ruvé, West France, on July 26, and handed over his hands to the old Roman Catholic teacher Zakam Amelam.
Both police are on fire.
The suspect was driven from his home, located near Tuluza, to St.
The new man who had not previously been criminally punished admitted that he had spent the night there but told the researchers that he was on a prom the next day because he did not have a good relationship with Kermich and Petitjan, said the source of information.
Researchers are trying to determine whether Kermić and Petitjan were participants in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that has taken responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, Petitján’s brother was subjected to pretrial arrest.
Doruss de Vriess before moving to Celtic for medical examination
Nottingham Forest club host Doruss de Vriess went to Glasgow because he intends to conclude an agreement on moving to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Rosholas hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
The director of the Parkhead Club is looking for the protection of the centre experienced in order to compete with the current first number for Craig Gordon.
However, Rogers was 35 years old at the age of De Vriesam because he worked with the Dutch in the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they won in 2011 under Rogers.
He has now replaced the English form to add "Wilki" and has been City Ground since 2013.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the season held by Diunfermline, after his return in 2006.
Her stay in Istendpår has ended with anxiety, however, by experiencing a double agonist, being "send in a trimm" from the highest level before losing Celtic Scotland.
According to the contract, there was still a year left in Forest composition, and Celtic was reported to have to pay only nominal fees in order to obtain his signature.
Macy's closing 100 shops.
The big business giant Macy's announced on Thursday about its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step towards helping the trade chain move forward from a potentially controversial problem: in America, it claims to be online shopping for too many shops.
Macy's regularly reduces its business portfolio, often closing several dunes not enough profitable business immediately after the annual holiday season.
However, in the wake of its summer announcement that it will close 15% of its 728 trading venues, trade chains, it seems to have taken a much more aggressive position than many similar retail representatives in terms of reducing their business numbers by adjusting the very changing purchasing environment.
The buyers and buyers give the lives of Macy's business in New York.
The retail giant announced that it is planning to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons for trying to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, such as the number of buyers has particularly affected the flow of e-commerce.
In general, the category of wholesalers has become more difficult because buyers are increasingly choosing lower price traders such as T.J.Maxx and high-speed fashions such as H&M.
These factors, up to such short-term difficulties as the ever lower international tourist costs and the time-consuming conditions that Macy's has faced in an unstable situation that has already increased over the course of the year.
On the fourth day, the company reported that its comparable sales volume in the last quarter decreased by 2.6 per cent, the weak indicator, however, which was an improvement, taking into account the very low 6.1 per cent discount rate found in the previous quarter.
The retailer's income was $5.87 billion (US$7.64 billion), by 3.9 per cent less than during this period.
Macy's said that it would cost it about $1 billion in turnover per year.
At the same time, the closure of so many businesses could be considered to be the recognition of a retailer’s fraud.
However, on Thursday the value of the company’s shares decreased by 17 per cent, which shows that investors consider these transactions to be a proactive measure which refers to Macy’s stronger future.
In his view that Macy's reduces the number of businesses should not be surprising.
The director general of the retailer, Terijs Lundgren, said earlier that there are too many shops in the chain.
The highest level leaders said for a time that they have adopted a new strategy with a particular emphasis on 150 of its most profitable businesses, trying to achieve greater sales volumes in already successful trading sites.
Jeff Jennete, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed instead of Lundgrena since 2017, said in his statement that almost all the business that the company is planning to close is the ones where sales volumes and revenues fall on the market.
"We realize that in these trading sites we are still not getting adequate returns from investments and there are often no levels of buyers' purchasing experience that reflects our efforts in connection with the Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would come in line with the list of business to be closed later.
Macy's said that it was still decided on closed business and that therefore it is not quite clear how many employees will be released.
The retailer is not entirely from the main markets where he is currently a business, but he is thinking of closing businesses located in less active places.
This process will not be more likely for the management of shopping centres, which will count with large tenants like Macy's, to attract and maintain other smaller businesses in their shopping centres.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, breast-feeding from repeatedly-filled bottles can be "far worse than swallowing your dog’s spinal cord", taking into account how many bacteria you will encounter.
The Home Page Trademill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to check 12 different types of water bottles - with a drawable cart, with a spare cart, with a loaded cart, and with a salmin.
Each bottle had been used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refilled water bottle may be as unclean as a dog's rotary.
"On the basis of the 12 of our tested water bottles, we found that there may be a large number of viable bacteria in the re-uses: more than 300,000 colonies forming units per square centimetre (KV/kv.cm.)," says Traadmill Reviews.
The vials with detached caps showed a higher amount of microb than 900 000 colonies per square centimetre (CV/kv.cm.)
The vials were microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or bleeding.
Bottles with pressure pumps were the worst of 162,000 KVV/kv.cm. and only slightly less than 160 000 KVV/kv.cm.
"Dear water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's pain," is indicated on the website.
The sharper skin is observed for bottles with salmon, where only part of the bacteria present in the other bottles were found - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because water pumps up to the bottom of the palm tree, instead of attaching it to its malts and thus attaching the smelling microbes.
The vials with salmon are characterized as "increasing harmless".
"On the basis of our test results, we recommend that we select bottles with salmon and small bacteria and because of the absence of harmful microbes," says the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, the stainless steel is better chosen than plastic.
In addition, the water bottles without the spray and hard-cleaning places will be less microbe.
At home readers are advised to drop bottles after each use, ideally with a weak washing solution.
Religion must become modern or be forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party recently appointed Hilary Clinton as its president's candidate.
If the results of the last rounds will also appear in the same vote, in January America will start its first president - women.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meja spoke to British Prime Minister Teresa Meja about the European Council's appearance with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are raised to know that, thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any professional field.
And today's new girls can be targeted at several existing models by working in the highest leadership field.
So, is it really a long and hard fight for equality between women that is finally over?
Hilary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but the leadership of women in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
Women's leadership in the religious field is still a controversial issue.
Last week, the French pope announced the establishment of a new Commission with a view to assessing whether women would be employed as deacons in the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Anglican Church introduced Libya to Lein as the first woman-in-law, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
As long as the women's ranks of women have been ranked in the Jewish movement since the early 1970s and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, there is still a strong opposition to the orthodox Jewish women's concept.
In November 2015, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the right order of women in the United States of America, the Council of Orthodox rabbis published a complaint to the public about the fact that the concept of women-rabina is contrary to the law.
Not without ironia, when Hilaria Clintone was appointed as a candidate for the post of president of democracy, a group of U.S. leading right-wing rabbis, who opposed women's order, began a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between time and energy?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be traditional values.
This demonstrates the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who are against women's order do so on the ground that it's not "traditional."
However, the acquisition of traditions in this way is its price.
And the price of such unilateral thinking may paradoxically introduce the tradition of itself by withdrawing from the traditional community the oxygen it needs to sustain its survival.
In the book Augusta Chaujamariči, in World War I, Barbara Tačmena highlights the danger of giving priority to tradition to what has become known as "the tragedy of the war."
By the beginning of World War I, when war broke out in close proximity to war on the most powerful artillery, which is expected from further distances, it became effective to conceal the war as long as possible.
The British and German forces responded to these changes by replacing their enlightened uniforms against the gradually yellow and brown.
However, the French soldiers continued to wear the same red hats and biscuits that made them easy targets.
The French Minister of War, Adolfa Mesim, proposed that the military under him might act similarly, being held in contempt and opposition.
The pools represented the army's charms and prestige, and the military traditionalists were not prepared to refuse.
On behalf of France, former Minister of War Ejgen Etjéns spoke on behalf of the parliament.
"Reject from the red biscuits?" he said.
Sometimes!
"It was an unexplainable and illogical annex to the most visible of all colours," later wrote in the Mass, "it was supposed to have been bad consequences."
The religious leaders who fight for women’s membership in the religious roles that lead to their participation in the same camps may be involved.
By focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking an important question: "What changes are necessary for religion to collapse?" They risk losing about 50 per cent of their followers.
They also abandon the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise have given to the whole community.
Stoping that men continue to eat biscuits when they are talking about religion may be traditional, but as the red biscuits show it, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Sieve Orthodox feminist associations) in Britain and a student of orthodox rabbinicism in Yeshivata Maharate, New York.
The newborn son of Paradise was endowed with new skills.
From 1 to 6 August, at the centre of Rojupes’s children and youth initiatives, the "Varavíkss Tilti" movement, during which participants were born, was performed and acquired new skills.
On the day of the end of the wedding, the children were deeply moved by the glass bubbles.
The youth affairs specialist at the Rojupes Children and Youth Initiative Centre, Mara Folkmane, told us that this was one of the activities that the participants enjoyed most.
It was also a great pleasure to visit the "Mazbebirīn" of the Einar Kalnī shipyard.
Most of the children liked lasergravier because it was possible to see how the sign on the computer is less placed on the child.
E. Kalnijs has told us what subjects should be taught in school if he wants to work on board, that is, mathematics, especially geometry, computers, and technical marking and drawing.
He also stressed that this profession should work more with the brains than with the muscles.
There are individual orders in a small case and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know others better, participants participated in different games at the beginning of the match, as well as jointly formed the "gerboni" games.
On the third day a crossing took place from the sea from Roja to Jocone, and natural materials were collected along the way that were later used for the operation of maps.
Sports games were also held that were of particular importance to the participants.
We went to the homes of many people where we had a sports and restroom, played football and a network bomb.
Children like sports activities, we have many children playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sports.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
The next day, with the help of self-sustaining mass, the decorations that will later be used as marker holders.
It was also a talent evening, and the children chose to sit with them, and one evening they were assigned to take the lead.
There were also board games, each one could show his knowledge during photo orientation, where objects were to be found after images and photographed with them.
The task was to form a different picture.
We also colored mandals - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one job that will interest everyone - next door is sport, another job that creates.
"Now it looks like everyone works out with glass lighting," explained Mr. Folkmane.
At the end of the campaign, diplomas were presented for creativity, sport and assistance - several children were directly involved in economic work.
The name of the name "Varavíšnis Tilti" has been created because it includes children from three associations - the centre of the Rojupes and Melsila Children and Youth Initiatives, as well as the innovative Rojas multifunctional centre "Strops".
These are the same lines of agreement.
If parents think things out faster, we're going to get ideas; if they're different, they're going to get away from us.
We share experiences.
This year 30 participants were involved - children who worked actively during the year.
"We expected it to be 30, and it also came," said Mr. Folkmane.
The attack took place five years ago.
It began in 2010, when Roja's new social service decided that many families and children in the summer need to organise shelters.
However, the situation in Paradise has improved by this time, and the replacement is now intended for the new population who come and work in youth centres.
The aim is to take full advantage of the free time.
Two seizures occurred earlier, and 20 children were involved in each of them, and now because the number of children in the country as a whole is reduced by only one seizure.
Similar activities are taking place during the past year.
In the children's label, the surrounding glass, the fortress came by Enar Kalnijš, who taught wood heating, the formation of machines from wood, with the imagery of various forms.
There's also a new technique - enkaustic, it's coloring with a hot spring.
The teacher’s Ilze Šelkov was involved in creating polymer materials, forming tubes and various screws.
We make linens from natural materials, interesting mandals from bees, horses, lenses, leaves are collected in red.
Let's try to use what we have around us.
The youth centre in the winter is working from 15.00 to 20.00, while in the summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"In the red youth centre, 15 children are visited on average on a day," says Mr. Folkmane.
She points out that there is great support for the new Council of Europe, which understands the need to provide resources for children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may be seasonal tickets only if you sign a behavior contract" and will agree not to criticize the club in social media.
While we recognize that everyone has the right to their own personal opinion, the publication of misleading comments on such websites is no longer good.
The manager's employer was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former police inspector Clifa Iger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career.
The letter continues: "I need to inform you that the award of the season ticket will be renewed under the condition that you will sign "ABC" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing misleading or misleading comments about the club or club representatives of all kinds of social media at home or any other kind of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking with Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket payment that it was not received, and two days later a mail was received.
He went to the club last night and said, "They told me I'm too "twisted," to keep smiling also to others who are funny."
Ritual freedom of movement at Dalmatia
What do you think of the word "dangerous"?
I've traveled from all strength," said Colina, former U.S. Navy commander, who just drove 25 sailboats across some of the vast central part of Croatia's island, without leaving anything there except the Spanish Swiss and the white seamen's expression that had been wiped out in the wild mountains.
Some bikers sing heavenly or numerous child - rearing games to make it easier to be in the mountains.
Colina's cousin Petija recommends "The Little Engine That Could Have It".
Other numbers of limbs or just suffer in the ear, thinking of what it requires to get into a transam similar situation that is spoken of by riding riding bicycles.
The colina is more free of charge than the variety.
Running some doors ahead of her is what's going on in Hyu Green like the movie "Four Cats and One Child" at the beginning.
Her mission and my mission are a long "lucus" yacht and bike ride along the north coast of Croatia and on the islands organized by Freedom Treks.
Rising in the summer heat on a mountainous site such as Croatia may not correspond to every understanding of gravity, but it says that Northdalmation is easier to launch than Southdalmation, our sails are soft, and when we completed the form of reservation, free and convincingly before all those months, there was a ship that did not notice which could provide us with an e-vesicle loaded with a battery.
Part of the deal's luxury is our floating house for a week, completely new Melody.
At the end of the trip, we can gather our bicycles against our guides Ivana and Ivanas and the ship's back to the shores of the green water, without contact with the sea oars, the rocks and other people on the rocky rocks known as the mud.
In June the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agree: enough water to breathe, but not solid.
Melody's got masks and breathing disturbances and some cracks if it's a feeling of energy after a hard morning on the walls.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massager - I don't care - will have already set up our beds, added our minibar stocks and left on the table a new box with chocolates.
Ivan says that it's very important to fire after riding, and on the afternoon we learn to fire on our knees or with our colorfully dressed clothes on the upper floor together with Barman Antonio, who is always ready to make one of our own cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m age with 15 boxes and half of equipment, not increased super-heavy, but also a stylish little cruise ship.
It goes against the small island port between fishing vessels and fleet-free yachts, and we are pleased to belong to them.
Colina and Petija belong to meetup.com group of friends from Washington (Colombia): to sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s large and white holidays in the Netherlands were so expensive that they decided to try something more rich for their experiences, and it is now in Croatia.
The contestant hat from his church is a sailing and sailing holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the rival Facebook publication of the pingpong rally is released.
The element of leisure experiences can be overemphasized because our graphics is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"Brokens and evenings are at eight," Ivans told the new participants at the opening meeting when we started a road from the beautiful old Trogir port, located near Split.
One ship's call signal shows that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal calls for listening and listening carefully to the next information.
"Good!" is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British continent.
One difference is that the company has already taken its turn, which comes from a state of overcrowding before Ivana issues the day-to-day travel card, but we all believe that we are afraid of squeaking, crossing and profile with hills and cliffs, although any other thing would be a surprise in Croatia's development, which begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
The full equivalent is not recommended.
Ivan's information meetings are held in parallel, free of charge from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to end up with thousands of different peoples, but we are a simple group - fresh, tired, American and British, who can easily meet at tables where two speak English but one - German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Rising promotes public risk, and the only competition is internal, respectively, itself.
Do not forget when group dynamics were more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we're on our way to Ivan Valley.
A small height is a threshold that should not be mixed with an imbalance that is good.
The matadata are serpentina and straight ahead means right: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same and the same: "Use one by one, keep the distance, and they are not competitions.
Let's go to the coastal nine.
All right, five too, remember you're free.
Take plenty of water with you.
From Trogir we will spend two days crossing the north through the Cornati archipelago, where we will travel almost all the way to Dugi Otok - Croatian "garo island" - and after a few hard days we will walk through the Tełacic Natural Park by engulfing the climate and salt of the lake, in which the sea is flooded by the canal.
It says that those who fall into it, thanks to its power, become younger.
If we do this, will our feet feel fresher and stronger?
In the small island of Molatas, we are again heading south, moving from continent to nearby islands seemingly unheard of.
Most of our journeys are on the empty small roads outside the country with extensive views of the sea and a variety of plants: olive groves, vineyards, hard crops, Mediterranean mares in the air and countless tours in the air.
We move forward, there's always a hurry, but when Ivan is about to stop, there's always a big reward, and small profits are like prizes for those who've come in faster.
Sports and public activists go on a lot on their weekend trips, and they know behavior rules by sending warnings across the line and leaving free places so that motorists can carry out a lot safer manoeuvres.
"You almost or didn't want," one driver said to each other after the heavy car driver decided to carry out the killing manoeuvre in an open space and quickly collapsed.
The brakes worked for luck.
Ivan has divided us into three groups on each side of the globe for short walks along the main roads, with Ivan on his own back to encourage and "give time," as Ivans says.
If we have to cross the main road, we will all meet, get off the bicycles and safety after crossing with our bicycles on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan will realize that he's not talking to a group of children?" asked the Swiss biker when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can stop it.
Not all afternoons we can spend some time resting.
In the city of Zadar, a Roman Forum and the Marine Islands are opened, playing music that plays as a part of the sea’s horror, through the passage of pipes in stone and open in water.
The famous Zadar sun is perfect to cover between the base floor and the shower, and after the dark introduction we return to the shores and observe the light-worked lamp in the trotourary of the glass of glass, which is actually a dance floor.
When Melody gets up early in the morning on the road to the pink Biograd Square, the sound of the eagles is no more than a joke.
On the fifth day we're completely free from riding.
The journey up the course of the Krkas River to look at its waterworks; then the afternoon visit to Sibenik, where we look at the thought cathedral, the work of Dalmatia Renaissance, as well as the holiday season on the peaceful Zlarina Island, looking for its local beauty, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is ready to take the holy ones into the stage of the attack
During the annual celebration of the Catholic Church, people attended the Lord’s Evening Meal.
France's security forces are in high fear because thousands of Catholics meet at the Lord's temple in the annual celebration of several terrorist acts.
On August 15 each year, tens of thousands of people flocked to the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees to celebrate the New Mary’s ascension to heaven.
This year the celebration takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the death of the former French Orthodox priest on July 26, held by two Islamic extremists who had entered the church in northern France during the Mass and turned their hands around him.
The arrest of Jaka Amela took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- the researchers claimed that they radically radicalized the online video material of the Jihadists -- -- were involved with a truck in the efforts of the festivalers of Bastille's day in the city of Nicosia, killing 85 people.
After three major attacks within 18 months, many French citizens will remain cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists has declined rapidly, and the authorities have been disappointed that this year’s number of pilgrims could be baptized quickly.
However, fear of mass references did not materialize -- and some organizers say that the arrival of visitors' applications has been observed for the last time.
Some 25,000 believers are expected to enter, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and some 200 Eastern Christians - a delegation of right representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they will not be intimidated.
"We don't want to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Kristian told the AFP agency, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life is going on," said Matthew Gwinnars - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up on our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to cause fear.
As a result of concerns about security in France since the attack in Nice, several large-scale measures have been lifted, including a large stock market in the northern city of Lille and a European train race race that was to take place in Nica in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to withdraw the applications," Fabian Ležesne said last week - a priest who was responsible for the official holiday.
"Factally, it seems that the attacks have mobilized believers," he said and announced the arrival of the latest short-term applications.
The head of the local hotel staff union, Kristián Jels, confirmed "high interest" in holiday celebrations after the attacks.
At the time of the dedication of the young Mary in 1858, extremely strict security measures were laid out against the poor man named Bernadette Subirı.
The area is protected by approximately 250 police officers and two thousands of military personnel, including bomb neutralisation experts and explosive search dogs.
The number of access points was reduced from twelve to three at the time of entry through safety barriers.
Catherine Simkox, who traveled from northeastern England to Lurdu at the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"By Thursday morning there were armed defenses at the shrines, and then through gates (with metal bars) only one could walk, as well as solstices were searched," she said The Local.
"This all scared my three children who have been in Lurda, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why it happened," she said.
This has not affected my impact, but it has made me sad that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were being influenced by these measures.
The fifth day's opening process has also been cut short - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the shrine, it will begin and end at the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of air space for flights over Lurda, the closure of roads near the traffic shrine and the replacement of waste uranium against excess plastic masses.
French Interior Minister Bernard Kazenevs will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to the Lord’s day, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic holiday destinations.
Many visitors come from relatives who are sick or disabled and who come in to take refuge in the well where Bernadete has seen Maria, looking for water treatment.
There, Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's celebration as "very unusual", taking into account "the risk of being caught up in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of his experience.
The 58-year-old volunteer, who helped the poor pilgrims, recognized that, in his opinion, the presence of prisoners in civilian shelters was "very boring."
However, if all this is done, it's good.
The Saragos Trade Centre is under attack by two interested parties
Two people were badly injured after a man opened fire at the shopping center in Saragos in northern Spain.
The incident took place at the center of Arragonia's shopping in Saragos on Friday morning.
The initial reports show that this woman could be pregnant by a woman who might be her former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal ran away, and now he's looking for the police.
Yesterday there were 12 drinkers and four aggressive drivers.
Last night, 12 drunk drivers and four aggressive passengers were contacted by the State police.
Four of the remaining wines were in the Zemgal region, three in the Riga region, two in Kurzem and one in Latvia, and one in the Middle East.
All four aggressive passengers were stopped in the Riga region.
On the other hand, 218 administrative infringement protocols have been drawn up on the transfer of the authorised driving speed.
Most of the protocols are drawn up in the Riga region - 128.
There are 46 protocols on the ground, 36 protocols on the Mediterranean, 26 protocols on Latvia and 22 protocols on the Kurzem.
The opening of the aquifers season is near.
Each year on the second August of the second, the aquifers season will be opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m. on 13 August, so the State police call on both farmers and citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterbird forests occur not only in forest areas but also in public waterstyles, and although weather conditions do not slow down as in other years, it is possible that only with farmers will these waterstyles be used as well.
To ensure that farmers, restors and aquatic residents are particularly cautious in the vicinity of the lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, therefore without jeopardising themselves or others.
As it has been observed in previous years that large numbers of farmers are involved in the first day of the season in the field of water birds, the State police, in cooperation with State forest services, will also carry out enhanced forest control.
During the control of the law, attention will be paid to the compliance of the arms and ammunition industry with the rules of law, as well as to monitor the non-cooling effects of alcohol and apribiotic substances.
The police recall that it is prohibited to use semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrols, including focusing on amendments to the Law on Arms and Special Instruments, in particular Article 22(91), which states that persons carrying firearms or large-power pneumatic weapons registered with them or sports, and that during a short period of two hours when these weapons are transported on or off the media, have the right to hold weapons and ammunition in a vehicle, but must be placed where possible in a safe place to catch, catch or catch any aircraft or catch any other.
The police call on you to take care of your own and other people's safety during the forest season and, if you have legal irregularities or any threats to safety, we invite you to report immediately by telephone 110.
In the event of any threat, the law guards are ready to respond to the information provided by the population.
New Caledonian coast struts 7.2 Magnitude quake
On Friday after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck the New Caledonian coast, seismologists reported that tsunamis are not safe.
The earthquake epicenter was located nine miles [199 km] east of New Caledonia Ilanter at 1.26 p.m. after the Grinichian period (p.4.26 p.m. after Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
In the Pacific Ocean, the Cunami Fear Centre indicated that there is no warning or advice at present regarding possible Cunamis threats to the region.
"Zemestries in this region, of course, are not unusual, nor is the last time of activity unusual," said the study center "Geoscice Australia" by the oldest seismologist, Phil Kamins.
It could be felt potentially on Vanuatu or New Caledonia Islands, but I doubt whether it is so powerful to make the positions.
New Caledonia is located in "Uguns Place" - in the Pacific Tetton activity area, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open control points at the borders of the two countries that were closed following the Venezuelan initiative on Thursday, the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro, sent them.
Initial border points will only be open to passengers.
At the beginning of the sixth day, five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20 p.m.
It will be possible to open the transport to Robez after a separate international agreement on security, trade and energy has been concluded by the President.
In August, Maduro was forced to close the border by reacting to an attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were attacked in this attack.
In July this year, Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border on two occasions because of the economic crisis in the Middle East - Russians who had come to poverty tried to cross the border in order to buy the first goods needed for trade.
This was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

Facebook calls for combat advertising to blockers.
The world's most widely used social network Facebook has created a sense of warning, making it clear that blocking advertising banners by means of special tools is unacceptable and users will also see advertising.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising will decrease.
Facebook has now made it known that ad alarming nature is well understood, but users will also be able to live with it.
The Court of Justice will provide them with tools so that they can choose for themselves what kind of material they are exposed to, reports BBC.
"As we provide people with more and more control opportunities, we will also start to show ads to those who use advertising blocking software," said Facebook advertising vice-president Andrjū Bosvorts.
In other words, users will be able to choose what kind of ads they see by selecting the brands and sectors that they think are interesting.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't touch or disturb their content," Bosworth added.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but the reduction of alarmed exposure generated by them is measured in the same amount of money in billions.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers use about 200 million people.
It has already been reported that on the fourth quarter of the business year, Facebook revenue from advertising was $6.2 billion or €5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved, determining what network users see in their new streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to collect or at least limit from new streams with "scaling" headlines that actually hide "empty" information.

The informal meeting took place at the fish processing industry in Kaija and was attended by finance minister Dana Reiznice-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Janis Düklavs, via the Internet portal "seesi.lv".
After such a meeting, the portal was approved by Reisnice-Ozola.

It is suspected that more than €130,000 is being acquired by bookkeeping.
The State Police (VP) Economic Crimes Management (ENAP) report by the agency's BNS representative Gita Gjibovska, representative of the VP, informs the National Police Department (ENAP) this month of 130 thousand recruitments from a bookstore owned by the Riga commercial company that has been operating in the company for 20 years.
The current information shows that suspected women have committed several years of illegal activity and have suffered more than 130 thousand euros in losses to the company together.
In view of the fact that the company’s officials had not followed closely the cash flow and trusted their employees, they knew only a few years later about the manoeuvres that were taking place.
VP ENAP police stopped suspecting women in 1963 and committed rape in the company.
In relation to the incident, the criminal proceedings were initiated on the basis of a large number of cases.
The law on such offences provides for the withdrawal of liberty for up to ten years by confiscating property or without property confiscation.
The detained person is currently covered by a security device which is not related to the withdrawal of liberty.
In Estonia, Zika virus antibodies are discovered for nine people.
In Estonia, nine people have been diagnosed with Zika virus antibodies, which means they may be exposed to this infection, the Estonian public radio organisation ERR reports.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year Zika virus tests were conducted for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden in recent countries from Estonia.
The health data of Estonia show that no acute case of Zika virus infection in the country has been recorded and that people do not have to carry out a Zika virus test in case of flu-like symptoms, but must return to their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Immunglobulin G classes) antibodies that show that the person under investigation has been infected with Zika or a similar virus at some point.
"This does not mean that the patient is infected with the Zika virus," explained Paul Nabers, director of the Section for Synlab infection.
Zika virus is transferred to the Aedes gene skin.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, BNS said to the agency at the interview with the Auto Association Vice-President Ingus Rūtiņš.
Whether there are manicable problems with dumping prices in the car sector or in the car sector, Rutish replied with a responsibilities.
Of course.
Car purchases are both different from service purchases that are easier to manipulate with prices.
The end result of the car must be paid in any event as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the purchaser is not competent and does not even create a quality purchase, as a result, it is often not known, "purchase".
"It's a very well-known purchase that's built to get something concrete, and there's now all sorts of miracles," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving forward from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the winner of the purchaser, but in some cases the public still has a soft view of these matters.
Now it is very popular - take from the lowest price to the cheapest offer!
However, the criteria must be laid down in both cases, and when they are taken into account and assessed, the decision shall be taken on the basis of the lower price principle at the same time.
The quality of the purchase should be very precise and market-friendly for technical criteria.
On the other hand, there is no need to value anything that can be expressed in terms of money.
The items do not need to be evaluated for fuel consumption, volume of emissions, service services and similar cases.
It should be known as the expected life cycle of the car, the departure etc., then it can also be simply counted together.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is interested in the orderer himself?" Rutish explained.
On the other hand, the Head of Auto-Association Projects, Peter Rubulis, noted that the problems are related to the fact that only one person often makes purchases for both cars and workplaces and food and these purchases are removed from one sample.
We have also brought to the consultation details of the purchase model reserve, which was difficult to name as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the producer of the purchase is very often lacking any understanding of the subject matter and requirements of the purchase simply becomes a combination of something," Rubulis admits.
On the other hand, Rutish added - because there is a smaller structure that triggers the purchase because there may be more problems.
"This is apparently due to lack of human resources and competence," said the vice-president.

"Die Reply" accuses "Dee Killer Unit" of rape of style.
The South African group "Die Anthrong" accused the director of the film "Suicide Sqaud" ("Suicide Unit") of the use of the group's unique appearance without permission, calling the respected director "dwelling food".
The group's lead singer Jolandi's mobile app "Instagram" will turn to the director of the "Warner Bros" film studio, saying, "Just like that, David Ayer, you're driving our style."
As she claims, the stars of the film War Delavinja and Jareda Leto have been told that Ayers are your wife in the field of filming "Die Anthrew".
"But you didn't ask permission to cheat us," said the singer.
At the age of 31, the music claimed that her group's partner Ninja (Ninja) on this issue was going to turn to Ayera, but he "did not answer how much food would be eaten".
Jolandi argues that Aiers has recovered the content of Umshini Wam's 2011 film introductions, which are seen by the South African hipop dute.
She also published a video clip that proved that Aiers Jacker and Harly Kvin had recovered the pictures from both singers.
Pats Leto claims that the art of wearing Jacker is based on hand-made music by David Bovija's image.
Jolandi finally voted in favour of the final assessment of the criticisms made by the film after the show.
Yolandi and Ninja, in real terms, Anrí du Tuata and Vatkins Tudors Jones, gained fame with three repa studio records, popularizing the African "Zef" conception.

Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats which will not return after the 15 July round test until the withdrawn staff.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavušogls said on Friday that from workplaces around the world, 208 Turkish ministers were fired during the survey of the turnout to Ankara, and 32 were "unauthorized".
Some 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their occupations in Turkey by the government, considering them to be the loyal US official Fatul Gulen, who accuses them of developing the government's travel plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey’s most sought-for people.
Cavooglu said that the US Justice Department team would be visiting Turkey a few months later to discuss its possible issue.
This issue has become a problem for the US with Turkey, a NATO Member State.
The US opposed Turkey's President Rajep Tayjipa Erdogan's violent fight strategy after the turn, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Cavooglu said that Turkish military allies in Greece had fled to Italy, the allies in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York and one of Russia went to Japan.
Ankar's newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoting military sources, reported that the loss is also Turkey's military supporter in Jordan.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting an American official who is aware of this situation, reported that the Turkish military chief of the NATO Command Centre in Virginia has requested US asylum.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavogoll said to the radio organisation NTV.
The time has expired since evening for those who were originally rejected.
We will take legal action against those who will not return.
Olympic game organizers try to clean up the green-colored nipples pool
The Olympics, who had been trained on Friday, came to the closed pool because organizers needed more time to extract the drinking water before the first individual competitions in Rio Olympics.
The water quickly changed color on the second day, the synchronous melting intensity.
The organizers claimed that water supplies were safe even after the larger pool near the water pool and the synchronous swimming pool were also exposed to light.
Nursing was not possible until the athletes arrived early in the morning, although the pool was finally opened at 13.00 p.m. after local time - only 2 1/2 hours before 3 metres of women's race.
The water’s color was closer to its normal color, yet it remained green.
The U.S. novelist Ebija Johnstone, who struggled on the tramline, told her that she had just come to the ice cream just to know that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on her Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp should be fashionable.
British nerd Tom Delijs, who was excavated by the bronze at the scene at the scene of the scene in the Twitter entry, also commented on the base position.
We hope that this means that in the last days, we are not as greedy as we were!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the local organizers' committee, stressed that the base is safe by giving green light to 3 metres ahead.
He admitted that some athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of a thorough cleaning effort.
"We repeat several times what we have said all the time - water in no way endangers sportsmen's health," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two sportsmen complained that they were blind.
This was the result that the first reaction when we saw how water became green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in peldbaseins.
We quickly reduced the amount.
We checked the water again, and it fully answers the parameters.
Simon Langfords, the main speaker at the Maria Lenka Water Sports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the FINA (International Federation of Pedestrians).
"The idea is that water needs to be peaceful so that the pool can return to its green color as soon as possible," Lengfords said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the basic situation surprised the organizers who were not prepared.
"Cchemy isn't exactly science," he said.
Some things you can see are long.
In the last few days, the nature of the water color has made things more difficult.
"There's nothing wrong with it," said Andrada.
He added that early morning athletes had access to dry trains, but he admitted that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the change in the color of basin was increased due to alkaline levels, such as aquarium water could become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent greens, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too many chemicals in water because sportsmen practice it," said Andrada.
We would certainly have been able to do better at first so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it's green, we're gonna make a mistake again.
The AP sport viewers, Jay Koens and Steves Veids Riodejaneiro, participated in this event.
Shanghai, Thailand, however, will be a forum for the suspension of cross-border communication
However, the annual urban forum of Shanghai and Taipei will be held in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, and on Friday the municipality of Shanghai announced its suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
A high-level municipal officer will lead a delegation represented in the context of the task of Yang Ksjonga, as announced by the Government of Shanghai in its official microblog account, Sina Weibo.
Both forums have been in the process of rotation of the city since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on sharing experience in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, with a view to "increasing exchanges of experience and cooperation" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
Since the new leader Tsai Ing-vens has been in office since the agreement reached in 1992, communication and consultation mechanisms have been suspended.
My Ksiaoguangs , the Taiwan office of the State Council spoke on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations could exist while the Taiwanese party adhered to the 1992 agreement on political grounds.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between the two sides," said MA, stressing that cross-border relations and the reality of urban exchanges should be correctly interpreted.
Uganda's President comes with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, hoping for closer cooperation
On Thursday, in the presence of China's Foreign Minister Vango Ji, Uganda's President Joveri Museveni thanked China for its sustained development support and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China was a meaningful Ugandan and African friend who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Zambian railway in 20 C.E. as evidence of support in China's south, which was provided even when China itself was not particularly fed.
Museven stated that China had implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda by investing in infrastructure and business as well as cultural exchanges, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than just financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and in building industrial parks.
He also invites Chinese people to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Vangs It praised Uganda's activities in the areas of industrial and agricultural modernisation and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner in Uganda's cooperation.
Vangs reported that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development and adds that China's and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political reliability and time-tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial park building as well as support for the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of the people of East Africa.
