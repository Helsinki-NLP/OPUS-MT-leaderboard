Members of the Wells Assembly are worried that "they look like monkeys"
Part of the members of the House have been amended by the proposal to amend their call to "CUP" (members of the Great Parliament).
This proposal is prompted by plans to change the name of the House of Wells.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the librarians said his group was upset because the new name was "Rome with Tup and Vdlub."
For readers outside Wells: At this wave, it certainly is of mutual importance.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the entire group "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
The representative of the Grand Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not convinced" of the change in the name, but notes that the new name CVP (in English – MWP) has a certain word opportunity with "mapet".
In this context, the W. W. is similar to the English yorkshire production of U.S.
The Commission of the General Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation by which the name has been changed, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all the descriptive names referred to by the members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry on the proposals by which it established a broad support for the Assembly to start calling the ‘Bears Parliament’.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the House of Wells, in short "CPU", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support after a public inquiry.
Members of the House offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be the head of President Elin Jones, who is expected to give the black bill for the change to a few weeks.
The reforming bill will include other changes in the way of the work of the Assembly, i.e. rules on the disqualification of its members as well as the Commission's own design.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they arrive at the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians will vote at a referendum if they change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name of "Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to allow for a further decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, where there is an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the Greek State territory and has repeatedly affected its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on the change in the name of the country, has become aware that you will not vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Camps are hidden in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr. Adams shared.
"Today both are gone."
Adams shares that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the districts every day where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people do not help save the rest of the shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, since it is not particularly likely that most new residents will be visited."
Both churches were built by white pajamas before Harlem became a quarter of the Black Mountains – the metropolitan community in 1870 and the "St. Martin" decades later.
The original white methodist passion took place in the 1930 ’ s.
After that, the building became owned by the black people in the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was a poet of black Christians under the leadership of the like John Howard Johnson who organized the fight against tradesmen in small 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire blackmen.
In 1939 the building suffered severe fire attacks, but Father Johnson's Enorias made a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
Similar David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them "the emergency camps".
The expert who used the campaigns in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this is the first campaign system in the world that was used by black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merieuder said they didn't change it from St. Martin.
What was played in St. Martin in the last few weeks was a complex story, filled with architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal.
From the newspaper – which is the leading body of the pasta, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the eeparchy in July, expressing their concern that the eeparchy would "be willing to transfer the costs of the newspaper", although it did not play a role in the acquisition of the architects and executives sent by the eeparchy.
Some enoriasts have complained of lack of transparency by the eparphite.
A 13-year-old child is injured by a shark in the Gulf of California.
Acula attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was a nightmare in California on the first day of the hunting season, the authorities reported.
The attack took place about 7:00 a.m. near the beach of Biacan in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he got drunk with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he got the boy to cry for help and got in along with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught a nightmare and was excited, after which he felt as he cried out, “Half me!
Get me out of here!"
Hamle shared that when he got to the boy, he realized that his whole area of key was broken.
"I asked everyone to get out of the water because there's shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the child hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gilles has been released on a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water was noticed by sharks, but it is estimated that it is not of a dangerous nature.
Gilles adds that the victim has caused trauma on the top of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastal line from Ponto beach in Casabllad to Sumi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety considerations during the investigation.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an out-of-the-counter on the Great Britain market for beautiful products
Sainsbury stands up against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up beautiful products stalls in their facilities where clients will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant outflow on the market for ornamental products in the United Kingdom, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are falling, the largest stalls for ornamental products are currently available in 11 shops across the country, which will be opened by the success of the initiative in other objects.
The investment effort in the beautiful growth is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the streets, almost occupied by televisions, microwaves and other domestic devices.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of beautiful products offered to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space, like the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also lets its buttocks grow again, so most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Crodden, South London last week, until the second will be opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The online and misleading marketing focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily in comfortable moments leads to the need for supermarkets to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Kope, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that objects will look more like universal stores while the supermarkets are trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sanisbury has Argos objects in hundreds of shops, as well as Habitas's items, since they bought and bought two chains two years ago – for which the company claims it has increased sales of food goods and made the proceeds even more profitable.
The previous experience of the fair supermarkets to prefabricate its facilities for beautiful and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the company concluded after a dispute about the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio's property, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing the rich range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, trade director of Saninsbury, made the following statement: "We have transformed the species and nature of our beautiful stalls to improve the overall survival of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The purpose of our proposal is to respond to every taste and every need in a pleasant setting, as this combination turns us into an attractive destination for beautiful products, which leads to a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "beg" after Holly Willby's refusal of 11 million pounds deal
Dragons Den Peter Jones' star "has got confused," after television director Holly Willby refused 11 million pounds deal with his shipping company to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willby has no time to mark home devices and accessories Truly.
The business of the two is compared to the Goop brand of Guinnet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his leaving in Instagram.
Holly Willowby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kiss", after downloading from their revenue business with the brand of lifts in the last minute – while focusing on their own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources share that Jones "has got confused" when the "gold girl" of television acknowledged during the intense meeting on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that its new contracts – at a value of 1.5 million pounds – mean that there will be no more time for his brand of domestic products and accessories Truly.
The business is based on Guinnet Poltrow's Goop brand, since the audience is that it doubled Willby's wealth, whose value is forecast to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced in Instagram his leaving Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his vacation properties.
One source shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave all things entirely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in the center of Marlow which is full of waiting products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this morning's lead, which is one of the most successful stars in Britain, could cost the company millions because of its large investment in products ranging from mains and candles to clothing and home products, as well as may lead to entertainment in the placing on the market.
And not in the last place, it can also mean a long friendship.
Willby, whose mother of three children, together with his wife, Dan Boldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
William himself founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, like Jones, who is 52 years old, joined the company as president of the company in March.
Two families often spend vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Boldwin's television producer company.
Willowby will become "send" of the M&S brand and will also replace Anna Macparlin as the lead of the "I am famous" ITV.
A source who is close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We won't comment on his business."
Serious negotiations leading to "relationship"
He is concerned about the criticisms that would result from the media channels for the launch of a comment that someone would consider "not appropriate for the President" and that he was too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump go so far?
Trip responded in his "newer" way.
"I haven't missed anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a great step towards the removal of North Korea's nuclear weapon".
But negotiations to remove this weapon are in progress.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho reported to UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see reciprocal relations" by the United States to the first steps of its country on the way to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are beautiful," he noted.
"We have been on our way to war with this country.
They were going to kill millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The president said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – ending the rocket tests, releasing hostages and returning home to the body of American soldiers.
He also protected his neodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this crazy area, we'd have about 200 people right there," Trump said, waiting for the crowd.
Guns and landslides in Indonesia leave the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
Following the earthquake in Lombok of foreign non-governmental organizations, it was declared that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, there was no national disaster, which required the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an undisputed opinion that there is no international aid which makes things easy," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the children" is a team to go to Paul, it is still not sure whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country's territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
Taking into account the persistent landslides in Indonesia, the country is still not prepared for such natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Achech in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other sides.
The apparent lack of warning siren for tsunamis in Palu has probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best of conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is challenging.
Natural disasters even more complicated this logic.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship has moved to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it can reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia's remaining infrastructure into the centre of its choice campaign by investing large amounts of resources in roads and rail lines.
But the lack of funds are constantly embroiled in his office, while Jacko is reopening his urine over the next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure, born of continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, spears and guns as well as other primary weapons.
See: Daniel Stirage brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute of Stafford Bridge in London.
Steridge got a delivery from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was up with 1-0.

"I saw Kante waving my ball and I just shot without much thought."
Chelsea took 1-0 in 25 minutes after the look of her remarkable star, Eden Azar.

The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased by 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
A large number of people have been caught in a trap between the ruins of buildings, disappeared after the quake with magnitude 7,5 which hit the country on Friday and led to a wave of up to 20 feet, reports the news conference to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.

I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have established something with their cameras, to contact us, since it is possible to have a vitally important information for the investigation."
The police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Birkenhad and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman to be their friend arrived at the place and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, as the police reported that it is currently informing the victim's relatives.

Cromwell's parliamentary status is turned into the latest memorial hit by "recording history"
Her ban will be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of the British cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But "The People of Cromwell" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "failure" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the "Cromo's Community", said: "We were not allowed in this debate to remove the status of Oliver Cromoel to the Westminster Court.
The economy of the English civil war was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The great presentation of Cromwell by Mr. William Hamo Tornikrovt is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromonel is considered by many, perhaps even over the 19th century, to be a guardian of Parliament against external pressure, of course this is monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an endless historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is clearly a well-known person who represents a side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve recognition and reading."
Prace killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by market pig in Southeast China, reports local media.
The man, who was only identified by his family like Yuan, was found dead with the interrupted artery and covered in blood near the market corner of Lipanshui in Guayjou Province, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pigs were prepared to inject their pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005, in Sinin from the province of Cinhai, China.
He is expected to arrive with his cousin from the nearby Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 market piglets.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, as well as broke the door to the nearby car.
He also reported that there was a big man dust in the car with a blood clot.
The forensic expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig has attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and twisted," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A record from a security camera shows how Yuan goes to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the dust was closed so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating a death penalty.
Although they're rare, they've been reported for pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, where after the attack the man was subjected to critical injuries.
Ten years ago this 650-pound pig caught a whale farmer at his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an orange farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can serve as "low".
"They're just playing.
They're like little children, extremely loving... they're not meant to hurt someone.
But a man must also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weightless hurricane Rosa will lead to the honours and floods in the southwestern part of the United States
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa loses weight while moving over the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is hurricane from category 1, counted at 5 hours a week east of the morning and is 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected to move north during the week of Rosa.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean, the synclinal, which moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the peninsula of Baha California on Monday under the shape of a tropical storm, it will start to push the tropical tide deep north to the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical storm along with the nearby synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwestern.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, bringing off broken streams and possible drains into the desert.
The deep tropical tide will lead to falls from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible that there may be light floods when rapidly deteriorating conditions resulting from the dispersion of tropical rain.
It's going to be extremely unappreciative to travel through the desert when there's a threat to tropical rain.
The heavy rain can turn cannons into raging rivers, and the noise bubbles will lead to rising dust and drying the winds.
The approaching synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of southern California.
It is possible to arrive at more than half an inch valve, which will lead to a small drop of streams and smooth roads.
This will be the first wave for the rain season.
In the late week and early Monday, clouds scattered with tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in the late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, it can bring large temperature fluctuations in the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
The week has a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer season will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a hot start in October, and from the south to the north, temperatures are expected to exceed about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast for time indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Bret Kawanau's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday after six television networks the attractive growth of the witness of the nominations for Supreme Court Bret Kawanau and Christine Blaysy Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place during the 1980s in the 20th century.
At the same time, the political opposition continued as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last minute of Friday: an agreement which was arranged by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flick and which the FBI should conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Commission that he was convinced by 100% that Kawanau was under pressure and tried to remove her clothes during a high-level purchase.
Cavanau, in his loss of emotion witness, is absolutely categorical that something like this has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's report number of 20.4 million viewers to watch the witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for the other networks that issued the hearing in PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also traditionally experiencing difficulties with measuring the number of people looking at their jobs.
By comparison, we're talking about a public, similar to that of this champion football match or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million and CNN - 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flick was the central figure in the fifth drama.
After the death of the Republican office announced that it would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras stopped on Friday as protestors were trying to get an Assassin for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire storm for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground which was released alive on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's presenting the truth to the state?
"You have power until many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flick refused that his office had already issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he reported that it would take place further during the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and exhaust networks ensured a full coverage of life several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Cavanau to the full voting Senate.
Ala Flick reported that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against nominations in the next week, for which the Democrats insist on opposition.
Flick was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party of Chris Kuuns.
After a discussion with Kuuns and several Senator Flek made a decision.
His election was certainly essential, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanau.
British Prime Minister May blames criticisms in "political games" with Brezit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused her of the criticisms of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her T.N. "Plan for Women's Game" for Brezit, suggesting that the collection of mythical taxis from Britain for the EU and the reverse is "completely absurd".
Wood Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dittin Simpson for the death of a LSU player
The police are under arrest for a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dietin Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and imprisoned for murder at second grade, reported to the police administration in Baton Rouge.
The officials presented video clips of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, which the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the war.
The police have discovered local glasses and they have also discovered Simpson's DNA, reported by CBS WAFB's branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he recognized the fatal shot against Wade.
Its guarantee is $350,000, it's notified by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Trial Service publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is a fire wound, the head and the neck are affected.
The administration expressed its appreciation to the unit for the release of refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the local residents for the aid provided by the investigation which has resulted in the arrest.
LSU director Joe Aleva's athletic sports thanks to local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played LSU team basketball.
In the last season, he reached 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach reported that the team was "screaming" and "shocking" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that concerns a person all the time."
Volcano sprays pepper over Mexico City
The volcanic Popocatell pepper reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity increased and 183 gas and pepper emissions were registered over the last 24 hours.
The center watched a lot of noises and earthquakes.
Social networking shows a thin layer of dust covering the front blocks of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital since the earthquake with magnitude 7.1 occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the year of independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protests against independence clashed with the Gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarisation of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists who were not allowed by the Gendarmerie began to target peacekeepers with eggs and dust color, thus creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that normally creep from tourists.
Later in the day, other police understandings appeared, when the police fled to their branches to take over the situation.
Over the hours, independent groups called "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the country's integrity was declared to have been rejected by "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, 40 people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even one year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but was dismissed by separatistly-oriented Catholics.
The vast majority voted whether their vote for independence, although the activity was low, since most of the opposition to the withdrawal were boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the conduct of the polls in voting sections in the region with a number of noise disturbances.
Independent groups wanted to spend the Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was still in existence, but it was forced to travel on a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that she no longer hopes for the opportunities of Catalunia to get independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be standing," the man added.
Despite the marked important victory, this was different from the last December's regional elections, which supported the independence of Catalonia's political parties experienced difficulties this year, since many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-defence or have been arrested for waiting for the process for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who wrote on his phone a protest in support of the police, claimed that the conflict was caused by politicians and both sides.
His comment is that "it has become more and more urgent".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catholic leaders awaiting a preliminary process last year, announced that he will be candidate for the European Parliament's elections next year.
He claims that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and repressions we observe by the Spanish government."
Londoners: Arrested men after the car broke into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car several times died at home in London.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings has declared that there are loads on both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible on the car to be shot by an ambulance.
Menga Gol wears Livingstone's victory with 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ensures victory
The new in the High League Livingstone surprised Reingers and brought the second loss of Steven Gerard in his first 18 matches as a club manager from "Ibrox".
Dolly Menga's neck became decisive, and Gary Holt's team was equal to the second in the Hibernian class.
Jérard's team is not winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and the next week it's facing leader Harts, who's eight points in the class.
But before that, Reingers is home to Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without losing the first one, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he changed to the Kenny Miller post last month.
Livingston missed a good chance against homeless guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead to the result far before he noticed naked and his direct game style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his attack went out after Alan Litgou shot across the wall, after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head back to him.
The housekeepers let Reingers play the ball, knowing they could seriously harm the guests from the stats.
And that's how he got to the winning goal.
Reingers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, as Declan Galler and Robinson combined and reported Menga who took the ball and scored it from the middle of the field of punishment.
By this time, Reingers had ruled the ball more, but they had to deal with the unexplored protection of the housekeepers, and returnor Liam Kelly was rarely supposed to intervene.
This style of the game continued during the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to do rescue.
Reingers' door was saved with a foot shot at Scott Pittman, and a hit with Little's head passed through the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
In Livingston’s punishment field, the centres were located which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for a dospa – first after the unanimity between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then with doubts about the game by hand.
"Fenommental" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on "Tony Macaroni Arena"
It's a fine game and a great result for Livingstone.
The team is playing just too much, continuing to go beyond expectations and improve its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not suffer change after the election returned to the High League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he changed the election after his appointment.
He's got real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing the defenses in a way that was superior, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Wall under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspiring.
Under the direction of Gerard, they show you some wonderful things, but in the case they were very under those standards.
They were missing their last dog before it opened, only once they managed to break down the protection of homeowners – this loss must be raised by Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the classing.
Erdogan's getting mixed up in Kwell.
On Saturday (September 29th) we became Witnesses of smiles and sonic spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and acceptance of Turkey in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kyle to discover a huge new gym.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish people living outside Turkey.
Because of security considerations, the police prevented a 25-mile crowd from meeting in front of the gym, but there were a lot of supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of whom the Kurds also raised their voices, judging both Erdogan's own policy and the decision of the German government to allow it in the country.
The various protests reflect the breakdown caused by one visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is condemned as the defeat of others.
A road accident in Deptford: The ride takes a break after a car crash
The driver died after a car crash in London.
The disaster came close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, located along the way to Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 in the morning British time.
The car driver stopped and got medical help, but still the driver died.
The accident occurred several months after another passenger died, after being shot by a driver of Children's Street, located about a mile away from the place of the Saturday disaster.
The chief police report that her servants are working on the identification of a man, after which they will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are abandoned, as is recommended for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six supervisors are injured in an accident
Six prison officers were injured during a rebellion in a high-security male prison, reported by the Prison Service.
The meth was thrown into Long Lartine prison in Worchester near 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still goes on.
To manage it, special officials from the "Tordano" team will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their freedom, as the same meth within a limit to one wing of prison.
The injured supervisors have taken medications on their faces and have received medical assistance at the site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Specially trained servants are required to deal with the actual incident in Long Lartine prison.
Six supervisors got medical help.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as long as their sentences are allowed to be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartine prison, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in the hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from parts of the peace struggle were called into prison where they had a heavy meth where staff were attacked by warplanes.
Uragan Rosa threatens with a bright flood of Finix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although frozen areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great likelihood that this will happen early next week while the weightless hurricane Rosa carries through the desert of the southwestern, leading to its own risk of light floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already set up posts against candlelight claims on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, South California and Uta, including in the cities of Finix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take on a different route over Finisik on Tuesday, as in the late Monday she can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Finix noted in Twitter that “from 1950 onwards only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Finix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Urugans Centre provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central rocks and the Great basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, which in some places are possible up to 4 inches of flooding.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the cause of Rosa rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious, part of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwestern part is currently dry.
According to the US dry season monitoring Commission, over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive dryness, which is the second by weight," they report from weather.com.
First, the path of hurricane Rose leads to the drought at the Baha California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which can still be praised at maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located at 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and thus loses weight.
This is why it is expected to reach the dryness in Mexico with the power of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain above part of Mexico can be strong and can lead to a significant risk of flooding.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to the north-west Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching Arizona's border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Uta until Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is an extremely strong rain in Baha California, North-West Sonora and the South-West of the United States," they warn the National Centre for Urganese.
These rainwaters are expected to lead to life-threatening flooding and carrying various waste streams in the deserts as well as caves in the mountains.
Attack in Midsamer Northon: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was found with injuries caused by harassment in Samirset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsmer Northon about 4:00 in the morning British time on Saturday.
It's happened in a hospital where his condition remains stable.
During the night in Radstock, a 17-year-old boy was arrested, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man reported from the police in Avan and Samerset.
The police are asking everyone who can figure out what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau "has suffered from substantiation and anger" on the Democratic Party
"Every vote for Judge Kawanau is a voice that rejects the Cuban and controversial tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump of Meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tripp said Kavanau "has suffered from substantiation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanau witnessed before Congress on Thursday, which categorically rejected Christine Blaysy Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnesses during the hearing of the charge.
The President made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have become witness to the intelligence, culture and qualities" of Kawanau.
"Every vote in support of Judge Kawanau is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal terms of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president said before the meeting, there were thousands of supporters from West Virginia.
The President directly viewed the nomination of Cavanau as he spoke of the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Even if I'm not a candidate, in fact I'm also involved," continues Trump.
"That's why I get used to it and I fight in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that Democrats have set themselves up for a mission "to stop and stop obstacles".
The first key of procedure in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected to take place no later than Friday, as a CNN report from one of the officials of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after landslides and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken away by several giant waves from the coast, when powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which announced the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the coastal festival was surrounded by waves of up to six feet (18 m), led many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami flew off after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't get away immediately because many became victims of the disaster," said Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesia BNPB disaster management agency.
"The water drew its own car, wood, entire houses, hit everything along its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people landed on the trees and thus managed to escape from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the disaster agency, photos from the air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, gathered and dried bridges, as well as surrounded by water jams.
The second towers continued to roam the coastal city on Saturday.
The family of earthquakes was devastated in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from the fifth massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and smooth river, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the streets as "great" and specifies that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the orphanages were built, added the speaker, after which he provided that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and prisoners could be higher on the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the road.
He also added that "communications are completely interrupted and there is no information from Donggala".
The red cross from its side indicated that there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get even more tired."
On Saturday the agency was strongly criticised that it did not inform the wounded Palu tsunamis, although the officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Social networks have shown a man on the top floor of the building who screams at people on the street panic warnings for nearby tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall will blow up on the beach and it will look as if both the buildings were built.
Reuters has failed to authenticate the clip in time.
The earthquake and tsunamis have resulted in a severe interruption of the power supply which has prevented communications around Palu and thus made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities notified by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products from the first need.
The city airport was reopened for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joe Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala were able to arrive safely to Palu, where they found shelter in the brigands scattered in their office courtyard, they passed through a series of relief scenes, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery operations, some complain that the rich experience of foreign rescuers in such situations prevents them from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, sending of personnel and foreign supplies can only begin if the site is declared as a zone of national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The poverty is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a matter of national disaster, we can accept international aid, which has not yet been declared such a status."
While over Paul falls the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to look forward to a miracle and that their close relationships have somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
The survivors released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subbandono, the trainer of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism team, trained two of the missing paraplaners for the Asian Union, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the prisoners in the Capan at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Manddi added.
"As an adult in the field of paraplanerism I carry my own emotional goods," he said.
Gendon remembers how in the hours following the news of the hotel's breaking up Roa-Roa's community by paraplanerism, he was disappointed to send a message on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was one-one gray.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
The robbers raise $26,750 during bank settlement in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning the robbers raised $26,750 from Brink's officer who ordered a banknote in Newport, Levi, became clear by a press release from the police administration in Newport.
The car driver has emptied the bank into the news complex and is ready to charge it with money, wrote Detective Dennis Macarti in the report.

All who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police by phone 859-292-3680.
Canie West: The Rapper changes its name
Rapper Kanie West changed his name.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as Canie West".
In the West, in 41 C.E., for some time, He wore his ring and used it as a title for his eight albums, which was released in June.
The change distracts his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changes the song of Ariana Grande in the show, which was rejected "for emotional reasons", tells us the creator of the show.
In addition to reducing his current professional name, West and previously claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that "she" is the most frequently used word in the Bible, which means "you" or "you", shared West earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the leading Big Boy.
"In this way I am you, I am us, it is us.
Passing from Canyon, which means only one man, simply to Him – which is an expression of good in us, evil, evil, confusion, of all things.
The album is a more recent reflection of our existence."
The rapper is one of the many known in his sphere who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of names and names, including Puff Dady, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences to the pseudonyms Lov and Brader Lov.
One of West's former employees, Jay Zie, also presented himself in a variant with or without a stick and/or main letters in his pocket.
Mexico's president swears he won't use his army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador has sworn that he will never use military force, which happened as the country nears its 50th year of blood repression against students.
On Tlatelolko Plaza Saturday President Lopes Obrador promised "never use the army to force the Mexican people."
The soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while left-wing student movements gradually spread between Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening up more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for the development of IE
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active at the development of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, says II Kay-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various calls from the US government made presentations on the subject of II, although the United States generally does not have an official II strategy.
At the same time China presented its plan last year: the country is trying to become number 1 from innovation in IE to 2030.
"The redoublement of the II development budget will be a good start, since all other countries are far away from the United States and are about to make the following cuts in relation to II," says Lee.
The duplication of funding can also double the next major achievement in the area of II to come from the United States, as Lee informs CNBC last week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of IC: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's largest IC companies – Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Melan Lee, he worked on an II system that won the most successful football player in America, after which he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese clone.
Lee grants the debt of previous federal government technological competitions, such as the Agency's robotic competition for improved defence research projects, and asks when it will be the next one that will help to identify new visioners.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work well to win government funding," Li said.
"Not China takes academic leaders, but corporations," the man says.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been buying university lights to work on II.
Lee further argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its IIA programme.
"I think that II doctors should automatically offer green cards," says the man.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people from academic institutions such as the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Leigh explains.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre on Art Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and from the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Art Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, more than $100 million is currently invested annually in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative body that wanted to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence did not notice any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the name of the country should be changed to "Northern Macedonian Republic". This is a step that would allow for a further decades of dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a complaint against its territorial whole, which calls for a wave of its involvement in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist-oriented opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while his campaign on combating his doubts about whether the referendum would be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The issue of the Bulletins voted as follows: "Do you support NATO and the EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price deserves to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formation after the fall of the Yugoslav state into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the framework of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79-year-old Skopjen citizen.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have done so that they will comply with its outcome to such an extent that the vote has already had a decisive burden.
To change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentarians must vote for this.
The National Electoral Commission reported that there were no irregularities reports by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the Urs.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Ghose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoorica and their son Dusko voted at a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which will open the way to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kawadarkov of 54 was preparing a small scene and setting up chairs in front of the palaces built by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads rather than through the service return," Kawadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to Macedonia's investment needs, as unemployment in the country is more than 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev reported, after he gave his own vote.
The State also stated that the positive outcome would lead to "the affirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published results from a study which says between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in a referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, the case of Macedonian television Telma, reported that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-seven percent of them said they'd vote with "Yes."
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is not successful, this will present the first serious attack on the policy of the pro-western government since it won the government last May.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Briton and marks the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have won Brighton's defenses and have won Manchester City with 2-0 on the "Ethihad Stadium" Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play on his neck at 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine Golmist was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He's running three defenses from Briton before he prints the ball into the empty space ahead.
After that, Aguero was called surrounded by four players in green.
He walked across one of the guards and then left the rest on the border of Briton's penal field.
Then he put his left to Sterling.
The English attacker with a touch turned the ball back to Aguero, who with his right leg hit Briton Matthew Ryan's back and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is fighting some contusions in his foot," reported the reporters to Siti Pep Guardilla's manager.
"We planned to play him for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky she noticed a hole right now."
But Sterling was the one who ensured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He's scheduled for 29 minutes.
In the case of naked Aguero, he was given deep in half of Briton.
He's just left the lead dog on the left wing to Liroy Sane.
Dreamed forward with the ball, after which you found Sterling with a dog on the distant fence.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to cut off near the ball just before he got out of the car.
City will meet Hofenheim in the match of the Campion League team at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Reyn Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherner wants to play certain Rockies fate.
After the Nationals weren't classed for the playoffs, there's no special meaning for another game of a titled starter.
And yet, the ambitious Sherzer is always hoping to be a titler on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is of importance to Rockies, which run with a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West class.
Rockies guaranteed their participation in the Wildfield game after winning with 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but it's still not sure they'll win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a good game in Denver, where the public and the other team will give their best to win the most important game for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a sword?"
The Nationals have not yet declared a beginner for a week, but it is expected that they will allow Sherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer it would be March 34th as a starting pizzar this year, when he was training on Thursday and he would have the normal time to rest by week.

Trump collects supporters in West Virginia
The President of Kosovo pointed to the situation with his voter for Supreme Court Bret Kawanau as he spoke about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"All we have achieved in November will be at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest moments in the present history – I also say that even if I am not a candidate, I am actually also involved, that is why I struggle with all the strengths for the right candidates," Trump said.
After continuing with “All you see this terrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They're determined to return their authority in any way, you're themselves witnesses of their integrity, of evil.
They don't care when they can hurt anyone they have to defeat, so they're stuck in power and administration, because they're interested only in power and management, we're not going to give them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves up to "stop and stop the obstacles".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "warm, mean, mean and unfaithful".
The President recalled the Senate Justice Commission, referring to the Senator of Democrats Dayan Fünstein, which caused strong reflections from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you have the documents you have distributed?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting – this was really cruel – maybe the worst I've ever seen.”
The librarians are no longer wide-ranging.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the little girl was surprised.
Finally, I am just the last member of the parliament of the Liberals, to whom it was said that it was not good to come – just because I am speaking openly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has had a similar relationship, since she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy has expressed disagreement during the past leaders.
In a report on the collection of librarians from Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that "we want to include all the congregations and be useful".
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Liberals in Parliament, the Friday assemblies were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most assemblies and promises for "believing and moving" policies have long been forgotten if they have ever been on a daily basis.
It was increasingly evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that every opinion would be assessed on the basis of this if the party's leadership was liked.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had worked for before I thought that they shared similar political views began to expect me to do a reverse strike and take positions that I would never agree with - either on national security or on the EU market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I am saying – there is a full-fledged tyrant in social networks where he is called for the rejection, rejection of his policy of death, statements that he does not belong to the liberstarians.
It's not just about me.
In the interest of the truth, I have even made more luck with some of my colleagues, since my comments on me are at least a matter of political urgency.
I can only get excited about professionalism and the destination of these colleagues who are facing sexual or racist reminders every day without fear of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this period in politics is how such attempts have turned into the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Liberians should reject the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, as with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becomes increasingly tense.
In the last two years, I've got a lot of advice to cut myself off, don't talk so much and then it'll be "all right".
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Librarians 32 years ago as a student, driven by the government of Tacher, who through neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most — whether as a local adviser or as a minister.
I've never been able to hide my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused about any way out of my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is opposed to Brezit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Liberians.
But my message is really not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the libraries or not: It's pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of rejection or political rejection will stop me from acting in a way that I think is the best way to protect your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrous: Unconquerable Ers led to classification
The two late sets may also have changed the final outcome of the drug, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game by the Tennent High League.
The team is already head of the classification and only one of the ten teams is lost to date.
The better protection and better use of opportunities have become decisive in the fight that coach Peter Merci and his team can be very enough.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us very seriously in the past match, and we're still lost," said Merci.
Robin Cristy from Melrose said, "Hello for Er, they really used their situation better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Climo, led Er forward to the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory House, released to play in a game by Wariers, allowed Melrose to pay for the result, after Jason Baggett carried out his essay, followed by an unsuccessful additional hit.
The climate increases Er's advantage from a penalty strike just before the half-hour, noting it after the solo action, and then realizing the additional hit with which it resulted 17-5 for Er's rest.
But Melrose started the second half good time and Patrick Anderson's hair, followed by a successful additional attack on Baggot, reduced the advantage of only five points.
It follows a continuous stop of the game due to the heavy contusion of Ruard Nott, which was carried out on the knife, and after the renewal of the game Er increased their progress after the horse of Stafford McDoual and successful additional hit on Climo.
After that, the former Captain of Er Blair Mcferson received yellow cardboard and Melrouz again used their number advantage by exerting strong pressure and carrying out their own through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional attack.
However, their homeers returned to the spirit and when Straan Hutchinson got yellow card, after he picked up Climo without a ball, from the follow-up punishment playing Macferson realized it with the help of Er's advanced offensive line.
We're doing the extra hit, not after a long time, after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's fired ball and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on a flag for the fifth horse at home.
The star from Still Game seems to have turned to a new career in restaurant business.
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan appears to have been directed towards a more direct and warm adult after it was found to be appointed as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC presentation, which is also a scenarioist and one of the two stars together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next nine season would be the last to be delivered, as Kirnan seems to be planning his life after Creiglang.
According to official registers, he is the director of Apionmorn Limited.
The actor held on to a comment, although a Scottish Sun source found that Kirnan planned to become involved in the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea Is Ours": The no-sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen are constantly patrolling lakes with a pond of sea stables in La Paz.
Over the public buildings are the ocean son flag.
The seabeds from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are struck with the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
Our duty is to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the mention of the loss of exits, delivered to Chile after a 19th-century conflict, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest of our decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an international trial on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere feels confidence and unity, as the country expects a positive outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzilla said.
Many patients will see the execution of the international court of the large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that after the decade of Chile's negotiations, it will be obliged to give Bolivia its sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to go to a controversial election battle over the next year, has also put a lot and a lot of court assessment on Monday.
"We are very close to getting back access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court taking a decision for Bolivia's benefit is very small, and even if it were judged for its benefit, it wouldn't really change things.
The UN body located in the Netherlands has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the trial of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments indicates that the case is "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been separated from the current government of Bolivia," Zarate says.
After he found out that Morales' military rhetoric was different, and the little remains of Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after the event to conduct a normal dialogue.
Both countries do not support diplomatic missions one to another since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be taken very quickly.
According to him on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits and for both sides".
Calzilla also rejected the idea that Morales – which continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the problem of access to the ocean as "political heritage".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to go out of the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue with nuclear disarmament until it can't trust the US.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never have access to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri introduced his word on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises they made during the meetings between the leaders of the opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of relaunching the unprecedented nuclear diplomacy over three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called "an empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would make the North fall on the knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the declaration, without Phenyan first making significant violence along the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that in Phenyan they are serious about their rejection of the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to organize the preparation of the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest list of massive hats that will soon be in fashion shops to you
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely block the sunglasses, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a bunch of amazing large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that cut the fashion floor during the Paris fashion week.
I caused quite a wave in Instagram during the summer, when the designers sent the eyebrows of their creations to break the fashion community.
Valentino's exciting offer was an extraordinary flight hat with a wide-ranging perimeter that literally gripped the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included jewelry, magic hat and even pineapple – they are not intended to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at exactly the right time for Helewin.
Many of the color masks had their mouths covered and reminded them of not as high as Hanibal Lecter.
One of the designers liked a full set of snowflakes and glasses, while the other looked like a step-by-step funnel ice cream.
If you fall under such fashion trends, you're lucky.
The fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come almost after "La Bomba" – the broken hat with two feet periphery, which was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratikovski.
The cult of the extremely unprofessional hat, which carried social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a fragile beach bag, almost as large as the wearer dressed in a bank model.
The amount of Rafia with the colour of the overburned orange, with raffles of raffia and stuck with a white skin, was attractive to all views of the article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the week of fashion in Paris.
"I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion shops next summer - after the designer made such a great impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for agro-gabaric accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland support a reputation for academic excellence, as this continues to be followed by another excellent presentation of test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their choice of career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can establish and implement a personal training programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone we understand a language, your words will be able to reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot read only English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's trials, we see that languages are the first to have the highest success for independent schools.
Overall, 68% of the students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high A.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have achieved an A assessment in Chinese, while 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland adopt foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages as an subject of free choice by the students receive the same ratio as natural-mathematic disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and beyond the programmes of independent schools.
A study carried out by the Commission on Employment and Working Skills of the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that, for reasons of difficulty in finding workers, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, foreign - language governance becomes increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language control, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person has a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having such skills that lasts for the rest of his life.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a few people of different languages at the top of the competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 full-time citizens in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language enough to be able to speak a language, since French was the only language with up to two-digit percentages with a 15% indicator.
That's why investment in learning languages is important for children today.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland every school will be different from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are more important for the United Kingdom in the future plan for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are strongly determined to ensure a educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of a State, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

Lebron will make his debate about Lakers this week in San Diego.
Waiting is almost over for the fans who are suffering to see Lebron James' first match with Los Angeles Lakers' team.
Lakers Luke Walton's trainer said James would take part in the first match of the pre-trial training team against Danver Nguets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in two.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said the Czech Wallon via Lakers' official website.
Reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel told on Twitter that James would probably play a little bit in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches of Lakers' pre-school training.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-match to prepare for the new season," he said.
Jump's Mitting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election mittens tonight at Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned tunings of Trump, which include stirs at famous places, including Tenesi and Mississippi.
By deferring the confirmatory vote for the election to complete the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened by loss of control over Congress when voting in November.
How long will the trip to West Virginia be held tonight and how can you watch online?
The trip to Trump in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia, down through the live on YouTube.
Trip will probably consider hearings from this week for nominations for Supreme Court Bret Kawano, which was alarmed by allegations of sexual misconduct that kept Sena's confirmatory vodka for one week while investigating by the FBI.
The main objective of this mythical family, however, is to help the republicans collect energy for the elections in November.
That is why President Donald Trump's campaign said that these five myths over the next week aim to "activise volunteers and supporters, as the republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important for its programme that the President will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season with commitments," reports Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refuses to be mentioned.
This evening, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsberg media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trump will take place this month in West Virginia – the country where it won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who is in sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to teach him social studies," said Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Radder Cup" 2018: The US team will fight until the end, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrega "forusum" matches on the following Sunday, they might have brought what was needed by "Rader Kapp".
The change of the advantage in sport is quite subjective, however, in which players believe without reservation, even more in triumphs like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They've been running with six points, and now there's only four, so I guess we've got some energy," Jordan Spiet said at the end of today's competitive day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points at only twelve distribution points.
As Spiet says, however, Americans have something else to show and their fans don't have to lose hope if we have to judge on the form of Spiet and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each took three of the four possible points.
Spiet shows a great form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the real leader of his team.
The cheering voices of the fans became even stronger as he progressed in a circle where with a precise hit he compared the results in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had two hits after the first two holes.
His attack, which won their match on the 15th floor, was met with strong upset reactions that make us believe that everything is really not lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think about anything else and focus on your own game," says Spiet.
That's all that's left for these players right now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Spiet and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed heroes of the "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but exciting couple from Europe won four out of four and it looks like they're getting everything.
"Molyud" was the only couple who didn't make "Gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they didn't have "rich" either on Saturday morning or on Friday afternoon or on the morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way energy passed between them and enthusiasts, confirmed the view that they are players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun goes over Le Golf National.
To prefer both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European glory were somewhat premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourball game this morning while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dabula" of the first nine holes brought Spanish and Swedish into trouble with which they couldn't handle it.
But on Sundays there's no one else who can solve your problems.
The "Forebol" and "Forum" games are extremely interesting to look close to the interaction between the two, the advice they exchange between themselves, and the way one strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played better team and therefore had a significant advantage before the last day, but this session of the "forum" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the end – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were seriously suspicious.
Europe runs from 10 to 6 on the last day of the Radar Cup.
Europe will have a solid advantage before the last day of the "Rader Cup" after it led the US with 10-6 after playing the matches of the forum and forums on Saturday.
The inspiring poet Tommy Flitwood and French Molinari began with two victories against the incredible Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National competition grew at four points.
In an attempt to return the trophies that had lost Haseltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bourne dominated the early "forforball" games over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. has shown more opposition to the "forum" matches, where they won two victories, but they have failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furic's team needs 8 points of 12 matches a week to keep the trophie.
Flitwood is Europe's first novelist, won four points, and he and Molinari, known as "Molywood", after this sensitive weekend, soon became the second couple, winning four points from his first four matches in the story of Ryder Kapp.
After Woods and Patrick Reid played without appeal at the Fourball matches, they were extremely motivated to win Woods and US novelist Brison Decambu with even more categorical result 57.4.
Woods, who has barely passed through his two games on Saturdays, has only for a time demonstrated manifestations of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses of 29 matches in the "forball" and "forasom" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for tomorrow's "forforball" matches, shared with Henrik Stanson in "forsom" the matches at the victory with 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a very pleasant, cold and uncluttered day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spiet and Justin Thomas returned the American hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Poller in the "forball" matches, and later they returned to win Polter and Rory Makillroy with 47-3 in the "forsom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Radar Cup, a team has happened to raise four points of deficit before the syndicates, as Furik's team rules to keep the trophies even at the same time.
However, after they were played in two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of returning to the week are not particularly large.
North Korea says "no way" to be divided unilaterally, without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea reported to the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and there is no way for the country to renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual World Organisation General Assembly, Ri Yong-ho said that in recent years there have been "significant measures of good will", for example, halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test facility and promises not to distribute nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and in no circumstances will there be no first way to isolate ourselves unilaterally."
While Rí expressed the famous complaints of North Korea against Washington's "responsive" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be restored, as it had taken further measures, its statement seemed significant, since it did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phenyan did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Unu and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "the nuclear depletion of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea is striving towards the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but from the United States they say that Phenyan should first withdraw from his nuclear weapons.
Washington also objected to calls for the removal of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "first we remove nuclear weapons" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and they even influence "the declaration of the end of the war," said Rei.
"The understanding that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the U.S. leader stressed the UN earlier last week.
Instead, the Minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun J-Inn over the last five months and added: "If the country concerned about nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stand.
However, the tone of Ri's word was much different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean rockets to the continental part of the United States is inevitable after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction," commended Kim for his cancer to take measures to disarm, but said there was still much work to do and sanctions to remain in force while North Korea was removing nuclear weapons.
Wednesday, Tripp stressed that there is no time for this and said: "It doesn't matter if we take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reimburse Phenyan for business measures.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue unhindered until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, we are trying to stop the financing of Phenyan's nuclear programme and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Rei in the halls of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was a good one.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that he was making progress, but only after a few hours did North Korea accuse him of sending "gagster demands".
At a meeting with Mun this month North Korea promises to destroy a rocket object and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the relevant measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the relevant measures" to which he was pursuing are security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard for a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all students to sleep more in an attempt to explore the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
A teacher has found that students at the university have a number one in the world often don’t even think about it when it comes to their own reasons for taking care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared a course that he considered to be his first-born in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he talked about the impact of sleep loss on education.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this even now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever talked to her about the importance of a dream that surprised me," he said before The Telegraph.
The course that takes place for the first time this year explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a number of interactive tasks.
On one side there is a picture of a room in a society where students jump over coffee, cups, maratons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are affected by the lack of sleep as well as the importance of the routine of sleeping.
In another part of the participants it is reported how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart failure, insulin, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just like you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," added Professor Caisler.
The culture of pride of "learning all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The provision of adequate and quality dream must be "the secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, since the loss of sleep causes the brain to be hungry in a state of hunger that makes them constant hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Caisler prepare his course by taking one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He says his course was "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the camp.
It is hoped that the next step will be for all students who have completed their studies to be asked to complete such a training programme before they join the competition institution.
Professor Caisler recommends that students think about setting up an alarm for lying and awakening and knowing the valuable effects of "green light", triggered by electronic screens and solar lighting, which can disrupt the circus rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's Gol Break Jerard's Team
Reingers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's independent team and won between 1 and 0 for Livingstone.
The Aybrox team wanted to record its first victory as a triumfa guest in February 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had barely won Gerard's second defeat in 18th match as manager, leaving his team with eight points less than the Harts' late team, leader at the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the rest, and the missing of the Reingers' constructive ideas at no time seemed close to balance.
After the Rangers match, they took six places, and Livingston is now the third one, leaving the second Hibernian only in the middle.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, as the side judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown off by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that won Er in the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with Livingston's same roommate, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied by the way his aggressive team did all the countermeasures.
Reingers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better when they owned it.
They were supposed to be noticed again in the second minute when Menga pulled out a touch on Scott Pittman against Captain Alan McGregger, but the semi-defencer missed the good chance.
Later, Kevin Jacobs' center of the fault found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou pulled the ball out of the rear.
Reingers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything containing it in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought there was to be a hole in the 15th minute when he broke up with Steven Lawles, but the reference Stephen Thompson rejected the Colombian claims.
Reingers only sent two exact hits during the first half of the year, but the ex-lord of Aibrox Liam Kelly managed to deal easily with a hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and with the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's fall in the 34th minute was surprising given the presence of the ball, it was fully deserved.
Reingers failed again to deal with Jacobs' deep focus.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Galler sends the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave Menga the cold blood for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the holiday by changing Cubali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing gave Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of a decisive and blockive attack.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in comfortable home-style games, as Litgou and Halket constantly rejected the sent-to-be games.
Holt's team could have increased its advance in the last few minutes, but McGregger managed to handle Jacobs' hit, and then Corner Litgou shot his head off the wall.
The entry by Glen Middleton from Reingers asked for a drop at the end of the two after he had been married to Jacobs, but Tomson saw nothing wrong again.
Year: The Manufacturer of the Hungarian Numeral
Page of our journal Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, before 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" gayer was born in Germany.
Gaiger develops a method to achieve and measure radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as a sensor number.
A crossstone in science since then, the Hungarian numeral has also become a great stone of pop culture when in 1950 the film "The Coronado Cambans" was released, which was attended by apparently amazing students Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What God has yoked together let no man put apart. ”
Rogers: This is a needle number and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these hearings, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common to many types of cancer and are reinjected into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, generally for many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-inject it into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Betezda, Maryland, "Our results assume that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, eggs, white leaves and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "learning" as to cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenya West made a statement in support of Trump, wearing a hat titled "Let's make America big again", while participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Keny West was interviewed during the study on Saturday Night Live, after making an unintended performance in which US President Donald Trump commended him and said he would apply for president in 2020.
After completing his third song for dinner called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "Let's make America big again", he announced against democracy and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's participation, where Hollywood star played witness to Bret Kawana's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not issued, the West's performance record was posted on the social networks of the Cris rock comet.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
In addition, West complains before the audience that he had problems behind his neck because of his hat.
"I was traumatized behind the bullets.
They said to me, "Don't get out of this hat."
I'm being bullied!
And then they claim I'm on a floating ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the floating ship?" claiming to wear Superman's costume because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
Comments were at least two times caused by public reflections and SNL team members seemed ashamed, reports Variety, one of them said: "The whole studio was closed."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the song Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West sponsors many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a "Perie" bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: BLOODS YOU HAVE BEEN TALPATED."
The leader of the show, Karen Hunter, however, wrote on Twitter that the West was just "he was himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward a man (by buying his music or his dress or by supporting his "art") for whom I think he is a welcome and spreading ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
We're like that," she added.
Before the show the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snup Dog was called Snup Lane, and the music legend Prince changed his name by symbol.
Charge of an attempted murder after a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with an attempted murder, after he was beaten with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, they say from the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
Kit Harington's Star of "Gran and Trons" is against toxicity.
Kit Harington is known for the role of the giant sword John Snow in the violent medieval fans series of the NGO "Tron Games".
But the 31-year-old actor declared against the stereotype of the match hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads young people to think often that they should be "serious" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something's wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxicity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the "Tron Games" Rose Leslie, also in 31, admits that she feels "too convinced" that this problem must be solved.
"At the moment I'm personally very convinced – what have we been wrong with men?" he said.
"What do we teach adult men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can sometimes be responsible for increasing toxicity because of many male personalities.
He continued: “What is born, and what does it teach?
What is it about television and the street that makes the boys feel they should turn into this particular guy?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or continuation of the "Tron Games" after the end of the series in the following summer, arguing that he "has ended with the warfields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a part in Sam Shepard's "True West" rehearsal, the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said his wife Rose's dating was the best thing that happened in the "Tron Games".
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays the game, the girl in which Kit John Snow's hero loves, in the fantasy series, the winner of Amy's prize.
The two concluded marriage in June 2018 in the property of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports a 14% drop in the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people are infected.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts that indicate a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the spread of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, says China's health services at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Nevertheless, each year the number of HIV and spinal cord people living in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was discriminated against in China, but discrimination against people in the GST communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values 70–90% of men having sexual contact with men, they eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of the problem management efforts.
Maxin Waters refuses to have data from senators from the Republican party, claims "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday a member of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maximine Waters ruled that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans of the pages of the lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and websites on "Old-right wing".
" Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the addresses and telephone numbers of state senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Yuta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol during the hearing of the Senate's allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kawanau.
The exit is real after the three senators asked Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office and provided information about its team member, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantial claim is completely false and is absolutely a lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly prompted criticism online, including by the former Presbyterian of the White House Ari Flescher.
"There's food in this refuse," Flesher wrote.
"This implies that it does not have a temperature suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
It must be peaceful and balanced."
Fleacher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by the democratics of Judge Cavano, who was accused of criticizing that he also seemed angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans for Waters' place in the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Really, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Walters said that her office had segregated the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We will be sure that performers will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be given legal responsibility for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
The "Johny Inglesh Explosives Again" revision – the weak Spanish parish with Rowon Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for links to Brezit in every new movie with British participation and it seems that this is also important for the reflection of the Spanish Comedy, Spanish for Johnny Ingleish – which started with Johnny Inglesch in 2003 and returned in 2011 with Johnny Inglesch.
Will the smiles and smiles that say how obvious it is that we are stupid will turn into a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, uncomprehensible Johnny Inglesch with face-to-face and "gumen" person has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is the most important when it comes to a great comical creation designed for movie viewers who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for a smooth flash, has a little bit from Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bin and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the remaining chaos after itself a traveling and international man who played Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads.
The last movie with Johnny Inglesh has two nice moments.
My favorite when Johnny Inglesh approached the helicopter, wearing a medium-term shield and short-term scars stuck in his arm.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is very weak and strangely eliminated, especially when "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor looks closer to children, not to adults, but to Johnny Ingleish's minor abuses, I think, are not innovative and focused, since there's no Actinson's memory of Mr. Bin.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked the British super secret network from spies and discovered the identity of all operational agents for the terror of the daily agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last chapter of the prime minister, which is the hope and support figure and already suffers from a full flow of political instability: Emma Thompson is giving everything to himself for this Quazi-Terez-May role, but there is nothing in the scenario to do with it.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that she should call a retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny Inglesch himself, who is currently working as a teacher at the Chicago Center, who is teaching students illegally how to be an agent undercover: there are some good falls here when England condemns a Spanish rock Academy.
English has been called up at Whitehall for quick instruction and is reunited with his ex-year-old assistant Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a happy role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's Secret Services and meet with the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister fell under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claimed that he could solve the computer problems of Britain: the violent Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo are starting their costumes of furs: dressed as servers, burning French restaurants; creating chaos when they walk on the luxury hare of Volta; and England causes real anarchy when it tries to use a virtual reality helmet to recognize the interior of the Volta house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since there is so much more content here for children.
A lot of average production.
Like other films about Johnny Inglesh, I keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Librarians refuse to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get pay for five
Jeremy Corbin's Librarian Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks, but to get pay for five.
The party claimed that it wanted the heads of companies to provide the economies created by the revolutionary artistic intelligence (III) to the workers by giving them another rest day.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
The sources say that the idea would "pass" the economic programme and the party's plans to divide the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week is approved by the Congress of trade unions as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
High source from the Liberian party said before The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be reported before the end of the year for policy review.
"It won't happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an effort that is included in the approach to the balance of the economy for workers as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promises a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At present, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Liberian Party.
The Liberian speaker said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's politics I don't think about it."
The Chancellor in Shadow John McDonald uses a conference of Liberians last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said it was decided to take the authority back from "individual directors" and "speculants" in municipal services companies.
The shipyard plans also mean that the present owners of parts of water supply companies may not receive their entire share, since the Liberian government could impose "detention" on the basis of the alleged infringements.
In addition, he confirmed the plans to put workers in company boards and to create private funds to transfer 10% of net capital to private service companies that can group annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if Cavano's investigation by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kawano has stopped the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators from the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview last week, the "60-minute" correspondent Scott Pelly asked the senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
So I called him after the case, after this argument had been made, and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical and unbiblical."
But Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Bret Kawano and to change it, there is a need for an investigation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret rejected it categorically," said Graham, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one she was talking about but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is represented by the "Global Citizens" festival, and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will be hosted by a "Global citizen" festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and is also carrying out such an impressive mission: the eradication of poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the "Global citizen" festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie Bi and Sean Mendes, but will also meet with the real purpose of the event – the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international group for protection, which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as voluntary participation, not sending to a world leader, telephone call or otherwise to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizens for 12 years before they reach their goal?
Is the idea of reimbursing people with free concerts a brilliant way to be persuaded to demand action or is it just another case of "clickivism" – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have written more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who insist on many different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the life of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds already have a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "Food Force" set up in the UK partnership between investors and executives, committed to "supporting children to develop their full potential" which promises Rwanda $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 posts have been received on Twitter by "global citizens".
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens as we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historical note," said the Ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman before the London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken, which call on Britain to improve the food of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "Food Force" project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CZVs on his website, he asks, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" replied: This will be a long and hard time – sometimes we'll break up and we'll break up again.
But as with the great civil rights movement and anti-apartite movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardie Bi, Janiel Mona are just some of the executives of the New York annual event, which will be the leaders of Debra Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use military forces to "block" and ban energy exports – Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its military forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's commitment to Syria – in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a prerequisite for the study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, guarantee that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink turned to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-Spanish objective, which is presented as a "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "one-numbered ponies", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration has a task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much more expensive option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "Northern Stream 2" which, according to Trump, transforms Berlin into "a hostage".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of North River 2 will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a clean economic project.
Crewell claims that Washington's flat-rate opposition to the project has been exposed simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view that energy cannot be a tool for the exercise of pressure and that consumers should be able to pick suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country is joining our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look seriously" the candidate for the president after the inter-election.
During a city council in Hollywood, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that I was thinking of applying for a candidate.
"It's time in Washington for women to enter and repair our government and this includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his appreciation for President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he "has led this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does about our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for High Court Bret Cavano.
In a post on Twitter on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological study conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of the voters of the Wallon themselves do not think it should be applied for in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply for a candidate, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this candidate.
The sociological study has shown more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, 38 per cent against and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party discussed with regard to potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice-President Jo Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byyden said he would take an official decision in January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSR of Trak Palin's meeting for Donald Trump.
Trak Palin, on 26th, spent a year in Iraq after writing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son passes through, after he comes back, is known to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she said before the audience meeting about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, shaken, come back and wonder if they will get this respect, which they and their arms themselves and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, including a report on domestic violence and the possession of a gun in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police administration of Vasila.
18 The state and surrounding Colombia support opposition to the new asylum policy
Eighty states and surrounding Colombia support the judicial opposition to a new US policy that denies asylum for victims of gangrene and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18th states and districts submitted a request for good will in Washington in support of the search for asylum and in opposition to the policy reported by NBC News.
The full name of the search for "Greece v. Sessions" was not disclosed, which the American Union of Civil Liberties submitted against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang members" mistreated her, but the US officials rejected the request for asylum on 20 July.
She's kept in Texas.
State lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the United States, as nations facing comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned to the 2014 Appeals Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Carl Rasin says on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be considered in accordance with specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle," says the voluntary report.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses immigrants' entry is worth the US economy, stressing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "to ensure the necessary labour force".
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the judges on immigration cases to stop the provision of asylum for victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gangrene violence.
"Escape shall be given to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," said the Session in its communication of 11 July on policy.
The purpose of the shelter was never to solve all the problems — not even all the serious ones — before people get up every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to save Palu while the deaths are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick boyfriend at an evacuation center in the desert city of Palu.
"Every minute the line carries more bodies.
The clean water is free."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their alleged achievements.
Hundreds of people are injured, and patients affected by earthquakes with 7.5 magnetism are filled.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the back and shoulder, were outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated on open due to continued secondary injuries.
His eyes are filled with tears when I remember how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was pressed into the ruined wall," said Harris before Associated Press, adding that he came into town with his family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Messenger accused China of "tourmous" with "propagandistic advertising"
A week after an official newspaper in China released a statement of four pages in an American daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US propaganda press.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for China's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to get involved in the elections for the US Congress on 6 November.
Trump's charge that Peki is trying to introduce the elections for the American Congress noted what American officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to send commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an easing trade war, where import tariffs between countries are equal.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade war trade customs in China were intended to hit exporters in such states as Iowa, which supported the Republican party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and an ex-year governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment in the weekly number of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this storm by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government is using the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and press, making a paid commercial in the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"In contrast, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see the real impact of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although it does not mention exactly who.
With the chaos of Cavano, the Republicans are blocking women's vote for the inter-elections, warning analysts
Since many of the high-ranking republicans are behind and protecting the nominations for Supreme Court Bret Kawano in relation to several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a responsible response, especially from women, during the upcoming inter-elections.
The emotions about this are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Raher, professor of politics at Maxwell University in Syracuse, before The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said it is doubtful whether the last moment of Senator Jeff Flick (R-Arisona)'s investigation by the FBI would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jin-Pierer, senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive moveOn group on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors were scanning "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be eliminated," said the newspaper Stu Rothenberg, a non-participated political analyst.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among female voters in the pre-election and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before the public testimony of the Forum describing its sexual assault charges against the nomination of the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that a response may be followed if the Republicans insist on confirming the candidate.
"This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kawano is put on the scale. It is about how the Republicans deal with this and how they deal with it," said the press channel, Hay Sesil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select democracy.
However, Americans seem somewhere divided about who to believe because of Ford and Cavano's evidence, such as a little more clone to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Ford's evidence, and 35 per cent say they believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 per cent say that they believe Cawano has probably or certainly lied during his show, while 30 per cent claim the same for Ford.
After the arrest by Flickr at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate's judicial commission that Kawano attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals before her while they were at the party during her 80th year of follow-up to Yail.
The World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The World Wide Web Tim Burners-Ley manufacturer is starting a process that aims at opposing Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burners-Ley, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the way.
"This is a historic moment."
The Annex uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online database of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time it's all at the same time.
The only thing that is available online in the personal data store is that the user determines who the information is available.
The company calls it "the right to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills in order to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Burners-Lie, Bruce, a security platform, purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteers programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not when all their business models are fully updated for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a press release in Medium on Saturday Burners-Lee writes that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid base.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
Over the last few months, Burners-Ley has had a strong impact on the debate on network neutrality.
Although launching Inrupt, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: in the memory of a priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
It is noted 100 years in the birth town of the only English priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in war operations during World War I.
Colonel similar to Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 at the attacks of Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he was eligible for the highest military honor in Great Britain.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, North Hamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it's "extremely symbolic" to be discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's work, decorated with medal.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van took his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of thick and heavy man shot by artillery and cartels."
Later he attacked the fireline and with "immortal courage" he took the building forward before he attacked a artillery weapon with one hand and killed three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set up a vein after the paramedics, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the goodness of the real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
The MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night you're waiting to see a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't be witnesses to the main event.
San Jose's program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main cards and had to be released alive at night in the UK Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British observers were surprised when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after building up until early hours, especially because of doubt.
Fen described on Twitter the involvement of a child's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, senior marketing and communications vice president of Bellator, in response to the issue of eviction.
"Peppa pig," yes.
Company president Bellator Scott Cooker said they would work on planning the meetings to include the British audiences in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetition, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"But there's six mornings a week and there's no way we're planning things so that the event here is going to be held on Sunday and there's Monday.
We're still working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to deliver more on the fans, but we went over.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "better" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daily says he's grown, feeling better than everyone else because of his sexuality – but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman says that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "they're all like me."
In an interview on the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about the rights of gays to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent director of the long-term show, Kristy Young, is in the hospital for several months.
In his first program of Lavern Daily, he said he felt "less" than everyone else while he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: "To this day the feeling of low worth and the fact that I'm different from others is actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it's "something," he said, so I wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The twice Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT's campaigns and used his participation in the British Community's annual Games in Australia to send an appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly without the consequences and wanted to breathe the "hope" of others.
The triple World Championship said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lans Black, who met in 2013, he "was surprised."
Daily concluded a marriage with Oscar's carrier, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you pass through so much while you're so young," he participates for the first time in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died three years later from cancer," he said, "it's hard to find someone of your age who's been experiencing such floods and falls."
They became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Diely, and Dale himself says "his whole peace view" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you that I'm interested only in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized to his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father couldn't accept that he would die one of the last things he asked for is whether there were tickets for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be with me, Dad, or even the first line," he said.
"I held his hand while I stopped breathing and at this point when I realized he was dead, finally I admitted that he was not vulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've been thinking about it all my life – jumping the Olympics before the audience at home. There was no more great feeling," he said.
It also inspired and selected his first song – “Proud” by Heather Smol – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still made him move.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
The lost shape of Mikelson remains on the "Rader Cup" scale on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Radar Cup, but he'll have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be related to a crash.
Mikelson, who participated in the two-year recording event for the 12th time, was left at Captain Jim Furic's skate for the "forforball" and "forum" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the US team, the fifth winner of large tournaments spent his day as a fans and training his attacks from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old sportsman who was not even on top of his career was among the most regular players, is not in an optimal form for the hard game of Le Golf National, where the long uneven field usually condemns any wrong hit.
And if the game isn't enough to take care of itself, in the ninth game this week, Mikelson will stand up against the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with New Yorker Tommy Fleetwood and are trying to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who left with four points before the 12th single match are making a strong start, it can be shown that Michaelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his colleague, even though he could hardly say something much more different.
"He fully understood his role today, pushed me back, pushed me aside and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past as he did in this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing it just in two games.
I was hoping he'd play more, but he just got it, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at golf and play, like everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most many games in the Radar Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Radar Cup, which never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven match matches, but Furic said his presence also brings other benefits for teams that don't measure with figures.
"He's fun, sarcastious, lonely, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him, especially during this week.
He's giving much more than that just to play."
Thomas Bourne, Captain of Europe, is clear that the great advantage can soon be attained
European team captain Thomas Bourne knows from personal experience that the great advantage, which has been accumulated before the single match since the last day of the "Rader Cup", can easily be removed.
The datchain argues in the game of "Valderram" in 1997, when Captain Seve Balisteros' team was running five points ahead of the Americans, but the final law was almost realized and I can barely hold the victory with 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You continue to remember that we had a great advantage of Valderram; we also had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and Valderram won but very hard," said Bourne, after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with 10-6 on Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show both me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for an attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need.
Nothing's done until you see the final outcome of the table.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophie and we need to stay focused on it.
All the time, I have repeated that I think only of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our opponents, who are the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with the presentation of players at a hard golf course, Bourne added: “I would never rush out on holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow at the front line, individual executions will come out and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must give your best.
Now you can turn your partner's back, because he has to give himself up to the end."
Unlike Bourne, the opponent's captain Jim Furic will want his players to be better individual than partners, except Jordan Spiet and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Forric himself was from both sides of these great returns on the last day – he was part of the Brooklyn triumph, and then it was from the lost country when the Europeans performed "The Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question as the 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw brought his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good to do the same good start as you saw at "Brookline" and "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one direction to another, these interracial matches are played under tremendous pressure.
That's why we formed our composition and divided our boys as we want to try to do as we can tomorrow."
Tomas has been assigned to take our counterattack and to stand up against Rory McKilroy in the most important game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitod and Jan Poller will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the show.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Bourne said about his election for the singles.
Germany rescinds the release of a new warship
The latest fleet of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but this will not be carried out until the following year because of unfair systems and mainly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new flag from the Baden-Wuertemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quoted an army speaker.
The sailing court had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We understand that they will have a powerful tool, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship rockets, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of support – the newest brakes should be able to be used for up to two years before they return to the port of residence.
However, continued entertainment means that the advanced warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be already older when they enter operation, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 criminal fleet entered the capital last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding plant in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It is little known for the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if sent on a war mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class sailing courts will manage from a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older frigates from Bremen.
In addition, the ship has proved to be significantly converted, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the possibility of military forces to add future challenges.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as severe as ships from a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project – including team training – also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest franchises become particularly important in the light of the recent warning that Germany's military forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet "is actually exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had grown bigger in time, since the old ships were driven by exploitation, but no new ones were provided.
He complains that not one of Baden-Wuerttemberg's flag can't be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Follows the Secret Life of the Bees
A new study carried out in the Scottish mountains aims to establish how the beads use peasage when hunting.
It is hoped that the discovery will shed new light on the conduct of the unique flight crews and will help with future conservation actions.
The study of students from Scotland's National Trust will often follow the sights they meet, as well as the coffee shoots at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to monitor the season's catch operations.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of call sound of the tapes as well as which types are issued.
Then a map of the location and report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape map of their behavior.
Rob Dwar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of location are most important to the attractions and how they are used in all kinds.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the location management work, such as the creation of libadies, as well as the best way to maintain the mountain areas for the habitats and other types associated with them.
The populations of bees in Scotland and Great Britain as a whole have significantly decreased over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their refugees and lead to the loss of habitats.
The risk for populations may be wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of construction materials as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the beads are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a stick.
They use improved elocation techniques to achieve wear and wear restraints on their flight track.
NTSC, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the beads very seriously.
The strain has trained experts who carry out regular studies, refugee inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first one in Scotland and the only special reserve for the Trave property in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten species of seizures in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a wonderful garden for the bees," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and an adequate location.
But there are many other things about the beads that are unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better than they need to be digested."
He stressed that it is important to check for seizures before carrying out property support activities, since it is possible to destroy a shelter by killing up to 400 women and young seizures, as well as destroying the entire local population.
The beads are a kind of protection and it's illegal to kill themselves, tortmosis, poison or destroy their refugees.
Elizabeth Ferll, a Scottish official in Trust for the Protection of the Beetles, encourages society to help.
She said: "I still have much to learn about our habitats and many of our animal species, because we just don't know what's going on with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to be known", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he then paid 375 000 dollars to prevent the incident reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video clip in Instagram, referring to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the 33rd-year-old Ronaldo has published the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," said the camera's fifth-time gold ball carrier.
"They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to group popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballist smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that "unauthorized publication of suspects in the field of personal life", says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer will seek an excuse for "moral strikes in proportion to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football club, where it was claimed to have raped her personally, according to the documents given in the district court of Clarke in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was "good boy" by 99 percent, but in the case he simply submitted to "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documents, he confirmed that they had sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extradite agreement because she felt "dangerous" and worried not to "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the Ronaldo incident, he was on his way to join the Real Madrid from Manchester, United States, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grant Yuventus for the sum of 100m euros.
Brezit: Great Britain "will be sorry forever" that it lost its car manufacturers
Britain "will be sorry forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brezzit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it's "anxious" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of enjoying the border in Brezit’s case without trade could result in loss of jobs.
In the company in Burnaston – where models Auris and Avensis are produced – nearly 150 000 cars have been produced last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, the production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Kuk, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, say they're going to close their business for the Mini model in Oxford a month after Breezit.
The main threats of car manufacturers are related to the risks of supply risk in Brezit-free cases.
Toyota's production line works on the "right time" principle, as the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both from Britain and from the EU for cars developed by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without trade on 29 March, there may be problems at the border which industry believes can lead to entertainment and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to complete their inventory at the Darbisher factory, they said from the company, and that is why the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shammatic" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We must have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy our current success but also to be able to capture this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's programme 4's Today.
"After the claims not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful supply links."
Toyota can't say how long it will be to stop production, but in a longer-term plan they predict that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the company and ultimately lead to job loss.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is founder of the United Union in the company, says that his members are increasingly concerned: “From my experience I feel that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House.
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump with Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "repatriated for another week", as the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kawano has continued to fight, reports the White House on Sunday.
Rosentain monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump's and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor or not will thus threaten Muller's independence, for months he's been feeding his hearings for Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosentian rejects this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports of leaving.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump shared that he would "pretend not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal commission, which witnessed both Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Cavano, even more fun with the full vote of the Senate.
Trip's speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked a question about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders did not hold a pre-conference from the White House on 10 September.
The transmission leader Chris Walls asked for the reason.
Sanders refused that the regular pre-conferences were not due to the "demand behavior" of television journalists, although they shared: "I can't say I'm not in agreement with the fact that they have a demonstration."
After that, she pointed out that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is holding more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We have tested these statistics."
There will still be pre-conferences, Sanders continues, but "if press representatives have the chance to ask questions directly to the US President, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often and you're witnesses to practice it very often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the pre-conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the US president."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or pre-conferences with high-level guests.
Self-conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may show why, with his excentration and at moments of weird behavior before the journalists gathered.
The Health Minister turned to EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service for Fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has referred in writing to EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's appreciation and the desire to remain in their place after Brezit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before the arrival of Britain from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Over the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, as decisions are expected this year.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible free-trade scenario.
I'm sure it's a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I want to remember the great value of each servant's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU-wide and beyond it contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, such as for the patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is your home unconditionally and we would like you to stay here."
Christen Abbromby suffered a sudden operation after she got trauma on her head
Tenesi State Tigers, Krischen Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after receiving a head trauma during the meeting on Saturday, when his team lost Wanderbilt Comodors with 31-27, reported Mike Organ from Tenesi.
The senior trainer of Tenesi State, Rod Reid, shared with reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before the middle of the year.
"He went to the page line and somehow belonged there," said Ryde.
Trainers and medical personnel supplied Abercrombies with oxygen on the side line before it was placed on the nose and taken into the additional inspection kits.
Tenesi State's official face confirmed before Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies came out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/serious nature of the trauma", as well as that Tenesi State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abbromby, a second course with college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher labor tax when buying real estate in Great Britain
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher Erbo tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while additional funds will help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbin's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The government has expected an increase of over 120 million British pounds per year, which will help homeless people
Teresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay higher Erb tax when buying real estate in Great Britain, as additional income will go to help homeless people.
At this stage it will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters, promising more accessible housing and is directed towards high-income people.
The increase in the Serbian tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and with additional income will support government efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current herb tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second housing and property purchased for the purpose of granting – may fall to up to three per cent.
The government has expected the events to increase to 120 million British pounds per year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the United Kingdom, which leads to rising prices and making it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to enter the property market.
Many of the rich areas, especially in the capital, have become "surprising cities", due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy appears just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in herbic tax in order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property, stealing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to correct the UK's "tourage of housing".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including the control of rents and the end of the "no wine" strike.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “I shared last year that I would like to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means we're fixing our housing market.
Great Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not common for people who do not live in the United Kingdom as well as foreign companies to buy as easy as those who work hard in Great Britain.
Too many people's dreams of owning their own home have gone too far in time, and the rest of the street is too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My country's goal is to run a team in Scotland"
Sunday's manager Jack Ross said "the biggest ambition" in his career is to be the senior trainer of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has accepted the challenge of creating a club from northeastern England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He crossed the stadium of L.A. this summer, after the last season brought St. Miran back to the Scotland High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I wrote a fight for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up with the swords of Scotland of Hempdon, which we as a child watched with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
"But this option would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among the predecessors of Ross as the manager of Sunderland are Dick Lawyers, David Mois, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former teacher said he did not experience anxiety as an heir to such established names in such a prominent club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuić Town.
"To me, success at the moment will be measured by a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It's not gonna be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I'll admit I've achieved success here only if I can make the election back there."
Ross is only a manager for three years, after spending some time as an assistant in Dumbleton and 15 months in Harts' training room.
He then helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Meren from a team to a winner in the Championship next season.
Ross shares that he feels more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipoul, Folkerk, St. Mirn and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he reminded himself of the time when he got Aloa.
"I really believe that being a manager is the best thing for me, including before I'm an active player.
Sounds weird 'cause I was doing good, spending good money, and I had some significant success.
But it's sometimes hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, when I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovering research
The summer heat increases the incomes of the combatants to save British peppers, but increases tension for the faithful restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, who compiled statistics, said: "Because of the continued solar time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup in July, there is a similar model as June when the poplars reported an increase of 2.8 per cent, but restaurants got even stronger impact.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June is only deepening in July.
The booze and drinks bars, they reported the best results in their growth, compared to the low movement of restaurants.
Eating bees also suffered from suntime, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food had a 3 per cent decrease."
Paul Neuman, of RSM’s breathing and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we noted at the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer, although sales fall by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not be seen at a worse time for food companies' managers and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we were testing in August will bring such a desired rest."
The overall increase in the sales of peppers and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the entertainment of breaking the marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the analyser of sales in the tobacco, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is an established figure in the industry.
One out of five children hiding from their parents' secret profile on a social network
One out of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile on a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, discovered a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the false Insta pages
News has raised fears that material with sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" profile that shows their parents
One out of five children – some one in 11 – creates a profile in a social network that holds a secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 high school students shows growth in the fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
News has raised fears that material with sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" profile that shows their parents and at the same time have secret profiles.
A mother who ran into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to " rape him".
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of Independent Schools revealed that 40 per cent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Bukanan said: "It's sad that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in Borda of the Light Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was elected to join the Board of Medical Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished helicopter and President Ian Byti has identified this course as a wonderful opportunity for those leading in sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the last decade.
"Elyde is pleased with great respect for the lacco-Athletic communities of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the lacquet in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attracting," Byti said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, in addition to its four Olympic gold medals in 1996, and is currently a regular commentator in BBC, lost the ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I was hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show me how I'm going to get back.
It was an exciting job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for your announcements!"
An announcement about a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, share online opinions
The company producing cream pumps shared online opinions with advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are coming.
In order to note the release on the market of the expected "first wireless feed pump in the world suitable for wear", Elvie released her music and video commercial company to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides for the feeders to be shown.
Four real mothers dance in a great contest, full of snow, on the background of a song with a text including: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any trouble" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not true, these are my hills."
The song continues: "Explos, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, bring my friends."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused online conflicts.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it reduces the "opportunity" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie pump gathers discreetly in a set of pancakes (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “We fully understand that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them for a mother-fucking pump advertising that can keep their babies?"
Another added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others protected the commercial, as one woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I was still hungry.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little weird, but I accept it like it is.
This product is great," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertising directed at mothers who are tired (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like "crowds".
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women discovered that they were dancing with the discreet pumps put in their pockets.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who feed feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely empty, there are no pipes or pipes and gathers discreetly in a set of cramps that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they're gone.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Director at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pope is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a strong and provocative release on the market.
By drawing a parallel between breast and breast-feeding cows we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with it, at the same time showing at the same time the amazing sense of freedom that would bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump fell into the leading news.
During the week of fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the floor for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been smuggled into a palace camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped rapidly, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, partly because the strict rhetoric and policy of the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be raised with parents.
Most teachers are usually immigrants without documents who fear that they will risk their stay in the country if they want to recognise a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential employers and other older members of the family should provide fingerprints, such as these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking minister in the Immigration and Defence Service, witnessed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of persons who are or are hostages or members of the family of employers are illegally resident in the country, most of whom are foreign offenders.
So we're going to keep tracking these people," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules that some of them required to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the officers at the reception.
Many appear in a video conference talk rather than personally to present their case for a legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as inappropriate for authorisation will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent escape appearances or experiences, according to officials in the reception and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers shared that this concern increased by large equipment, such as this in Tornilo, where the signs of a child having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the location.
They added that the movement of children into "the palace city" without giving them enough time to prepare for emotional or to greet their friends can relieve the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria urges the US, France and Turkey's "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although civil war has continued for eight years.
Mualem, who is also responsible for the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign troops are illegally residing in a Syrian country in the context of the fight against terrorism and "will be taken into account by them".
"They must be released immediately and without any conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" both by terrorist organizations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 military officers in Syria who are primarily teaching and advising both Kurdish and Syrian parts of President Barar al-Assad's opposition.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries left behind by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions are harsh and can be turned back, accusing “some Western states that they are ‘inspired with unbridled fears’ that motivate refugees to stand out.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that aid would not be provided for the restoration of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war was reached.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last great strength of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a wide-ranging attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
However, Mualalem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would be directed towards the Jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaida's relations with the Al-Qaida front which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, consisting of government and opposition members, to form a draft of Syria's next constitution and to proceed to the elections.
Mualam presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "the review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no intervention.
Why does Trump win a second mission?
According to this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless, as many Liberals are likely to hope, his presidency will not be terminated premature due to impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the death of the viewers right now.
Since 2014, the premium rating has increased by twice to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is on top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, an executive producer of ABC's "Last candidate" drama, which tells about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack against Capitolia.
Nell Scowell, who is a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Scoll told me that he answered, "Because she laughed at me."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on TV from Washington's history, they can determine the future of "Roo v. Wade", whether immigrant families can gather again as well as the good state of the world economy.
The exclusion is luxury which can only allow the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see a group of experts discuss Bob Uduard, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Srah"; Paul Manafort's pilot's suit from the square skin for $15,000 (the "bright full of arrogant" according to Washington Post), and the accompanying descriptions of St. Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
Especially I'll never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does to make you feel part of a real show is to give you a little bit of each night," said Brent Montgomery, the main executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pown Stars, with regard to changing participants and day-to-day processes (counting with the National Football League, commending Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, with him on the north coast of Kawayi was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was closed home to watch MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not be separated from television, especially when Bret Kawano was supposed to appear before the Senate's legal commission and therefore depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember one time when we were doing all those stupid surrenders and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flash shared before me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments are influenced by the most controversial surplus in the pre-elections for a place at Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congresses and from there two titles for the same place.
The recently redistribution circle in Pittsburgh's front mentions the conservative Connor Lamb democracy that won its place from another round of partial elections last spring.
Lamb stands against another title, the Republican Keith Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly beginning with the new 17th.
The cards were re-designed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court announced in January that the old circles were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the republicans.
The competition in the new 17th round has created financial disputes between the main financial institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NCRC).
Lamb goes to Pennsylvania after the hard win in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a round of 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracy has an easy advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China after it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the control team from the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", Department spokesman Heather Nawart said earlier this month.
But sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from America for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The sanctions proposed, including the abolition of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be harmful to the Central American state with its unemployment and the rate of murder.
In advance of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which has served to further such a meeting last year, viewed as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities explained that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the collection, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new reports or sanctions from Washington.
Mr Bolton's spokesman for Mr. Belija's house rejected a comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next step may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstacles to justice by Mr. Trump, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is pointing out his investigation and that Mr. Trump has spoken with Russia during his campaign against our elections.
If the leadership of the Congress changes, it will be shown that Mr. Trump will have to report before this body, just when he is ready to appear before the voters as well as perhaps before the members of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not insist that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – neither is this the case with his likes in Europe.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight is going to take.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, and the West came to arrest him and to support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We broke up and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years on the planet.
The course of history depends on such exciting moments, and the unmistakably march of democracy is speeding up or amusing.
At the moment, the Americans have been set up before a number of similar attacks.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Several complaints have been made since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to write the president in secret and expressed the opinion that it was not appropriate for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in "Times" is not accurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Bret Kawano, required by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court in spite of sexual harassment and lying?
And above all, will we vote on the preliminary elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we break these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we're not gonna break up because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was abolished in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my missionary home.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn the candles for the Sabbath on that table, wearing swastika.
With heritage like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, an old staff member of the University of Brookings, is the president of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One legendary House."
Graham Dorans from Reingers is an optimist for the race with Rapid Vienna.
Reingers are the domains of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, as it is clear that winning the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G Group of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the wheel did not allow semi-protectionist Graham Dorans to play his first season match before the match 2-2 with Villareal, but he believed that for Reingers this result could turn into a trampling towards greater achievement.
"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game hoping we could win something and we left the point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but the whole equation looks fair.
They were better in the first half, and we were in the second half.
We sent a look at Thursday, another big night of our hunting in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, this will be a hard fight because they have achieved a good outcome in the past meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our public we can do everything ourselves and achieve a good outcome.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened through my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone straight.
The team is good and the guys are really having fun, the trainings are useful.
I hope we'll be able to push all our forces to forget the past season and to achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about fear of their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they want to get, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the study on Nationwide share that they have discussed with their spouses their long-term care expenses.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about this.
"People want a member of the family to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snaider, Vice-President of the Life-Sustainment Sector of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes known beforehand.
Together with your consultant and your family, discuss where and how you want care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining expenditure.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you with the idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions when selecting a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover these expenses or insurance yourself with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles at first.
Appoint a health care provider so that you have a certain trust that will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of an executive on financial issues.
You can choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions from your name and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and is traveling to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Create your plan."

Landlands and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced that the number of dead was expected to grow.
As a result of delayed communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Regent Dongala, a northern area of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Paul and Dongala that are found on the island of Slavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Solavesi, located at the end of a narrow beach overlooking the western edge of the island of Solavesi, with a population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th year when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongola is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastal edge of the island of Slavesi.
The Regent, which is an administrative region, is smaller than the province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Solavesi, particularly in the coastal area of Dongala.
The gain of Niel is also of importance for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite edge of Slavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938 it killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami crossed the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Theoocean Fire Ring" and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and wave tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong truce on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in Northern Sumatra activates wave tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people throughout the Indian Ocean, as more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 hits the most populated islands in Indonesia, Java, activating tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The quake with magnitude 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 hits one of the islands of Mantawa and activates 10-metre wave tsunamis that destroys tens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: Several earthquakes hit the Pidgin Jaya Regent in Aceh, as causes of destruction and panic, as people remembered the losses of deadly landslides and tsunamis in 2004.
This time it doesn't activate tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A strong hurricane hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Pailin's oldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Trak Paelin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Paelin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29-year-old, from Waasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in reporting domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report of the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the female police officer tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Pailin is kept in the pre-conservation building Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before a court on Saturday, where he declared himself “unjust, safe,” when he was asked to petition, reports the media.
Pailin is threatened by a three-step penalty from Class A which means he can be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and pay a global salary of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B slip that is punished with one day in prison and a 2000-dollar fine.
This isn't the first time we've got criminal charges against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sara Pailin, called the police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of harmful substances in connection with the incident.
His friend says he hit her with a smile in his face.
Sarah Pailin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she associated her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died of earthquakes that hit the Indonesian island of Slovezi on Friday.
The earthquake with magnitude 7.5 causes tsunamis and destroys thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network has been interrupted, expecting the number of dead to grow in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
In social networks, there are clips that show the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the wave of tsunamis flew off the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for suspects in a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed – a rare one that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at 30 years of age, used a truck hired by Home Depot to conduct the attack in October of the train station near the West Side Magistrate in the valley of Manhattan, gas passengers and passengers on their way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "meditated" has killed eight victims and "meditated" has caused serious physical injuries, according to the notification of a mental attitude in connection with the death penalty request in South York.
According to the judicial document and both charges may end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an extended federal court body sent Saipov a 22-point charge, including eight charges of a retrieval murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of the MPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intention", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov was executed as "serious, cruel and vindictive".
"Sifulo Habibulaevic Saipov causes injuries, injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Kleves, An-Lorie Dekad, Daron Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernan Feluchi and Alejandro Damyan Panuco," the report says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since New York's last South-South region was looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was later sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a trial for conspiracy and the execution of a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the 19th of June, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any sense of disappointment during the days and months after the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about the side, the police say.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL clips on his phone, the prosecutor said.
He also asked in his hospital room to set up the IDIL signal, which was shared by the police.
He complained innocently about the prosecution act, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "it is obvious that they are disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a trial for a guilty and living prison without the possibility of temporary release will only prolong the traumatizing effect of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team earlier wanted the prosecutor not to want a death sentence.
Member of Parliament of the Conservatives says NAYJAL FARAZ should lead the negotiations for Brezit
Nigel Faraj was called "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British party of independence stated that politicians should "feel pressure" – as one of Teresa May's own party members suggested that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would still be out," if Mr. Faraj was a secretary on matters concerning Breezit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to agree with the party's deeply divided lines was stressed by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Brezit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan "Checkers", despite attacks by the supporters of Brezit, supporting the stay, and by the EU.
The Unions insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels in spite of hostile reactions and urge the Eurosceptics and Librarians to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said before the protestors with the slogan "Exit means departure" in Solihol that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He learned that Mr. Faraj had to participate with the others, and that he had to get responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If it was the beginning, we would have left so far," he said.
Wellingbrow's member added: "I support Brexit, but we need to close the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world wars to be slaves.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that the British have changed their opinion and they want to stay is totally incredible."
Conservatives’ representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the debate, sharing before the reporters: “I just say, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us be elected.
Please cut "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open letter to Mrs. May, she added: "The Presidents will keep their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said he insisted that politicians should "feel pressure" if they consider changing the decision taken after a referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brezit and we're gathered here today to say "We won't let you change this."
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to change Brezit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country that has helped us to win at Brezit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-controlled, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supportive remnants moved on through Birmingham before having a two-hour meeting at the city centre.
The chief activists have raised flags with "Conservatives against Breezit", after the group's start this weekend.
Librarian Lord Adonis played with the Conservatives on the security of the party's application when it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all of Canada's technology and still, for the free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full face.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he'd "think seriously" his candidate for president
State Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "think seriously about the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Musachuzets Democrats spoke about his future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will apply for a re-election in November against the Republican state representative Jeff Dale, who was co-chair of the 2016 Tromp campaign in Massachusetts.
She's at the center of the speculation that she could take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the farm building after Trump entered into office.
One of those present asked her if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren refused that it is the time of the end for "the women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, including women on top".
He was arrested for Simps' death from LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when basketballist Wade Sims was killed by LSU.
Baton Rouge's police administration reported Dayton Simpson's arrest, 20-year-old, during a pre-conferencing at 11:00 a.m. on the east.
They published a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who appeared on the frames.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Weid Sims is shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," reported police chief Murphy J. Paul before the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade came in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trial and detained at the East Baton Rouge police station.
He grew up in Baton Rouge – Sims participated in 32 matches with 10 departures as a titler last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran By Russia: Luis Hamilton is ever closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fatel
Since the time Walter Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the instructions from Mercedes' team will play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously concerned Hamilton while protecting his position in the first two defenses, which gave Fetel the opportunity to attack his colleague.
Fatel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be a decisive step out of the competition.
The Mercedes also made a pist-stop on the next round and went out after Fatel, but Hamilton managed to stop him after a string of manoeuvre and carrying "gum" rubber, which forced Ferrari's pilot with no desire to release the inner part of the track in order to avoid punishment with extra time after he had already closed his opponent's way with a dangerous double-protected manoeuvre on the third floor.
I set up my 21st birthday, Max Verstapen starts from the back row of the start-up line and was seven after the end of the first round.
After that, he even led a long period of competition, since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the competition and possibly to defeat Kimi Raikonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered the Pit-stop in the 44th round, but he failed to pay enough in the next eight rounds and in the final account Raykonen finished fourth.
It was a hard day, since Walter did a great job all week and appeared like a real gentleman when he let me fight him.
The team has done a great job to win the first two places on the floor," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump played with Senator Diane Fantstein on the rally on Saturday because she claimed she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accused the prosecutor of Supreme Court Bret Kawano of sexual harassment.
During a rally discussion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the evidence provided by the Forum before the Senate's legal commission, and instead commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad and hateful and untrue".
"What can happen to the good that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evils, and hateful, and unfaithful," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fanstein, are you out of your way?
Do you remember her answer... did you leave the document - "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we distribute... no, we didn't distribute," he added, like, the senator.
Fiantian sent the letter with details on Ford's claims against Cavano in July, which was spread earlier in September – but Fiantian refuses this distribution to happen from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Fantenstein told the Commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wanted."
But her refusal was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the prosecutor for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the President stated that democracies use their own claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their authority with all possible means.
Look at the injustice, the shame, they don't care who's gonna hurt who they have to defeat in order to get their power and control back," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dondy Stars 5-3 Belfast Jants
Patrick Duyer noticed two holes for Janets against Dondy.
Dondy Stares returned for the fifth loss in Elite League against Belfast Jaints, winning a race in Dundy with 5-3 on Saturday.
Janets was taken early into a two-year-old fight after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni were equal to the housekeepers before Dwyer re-established Jainths' fate.
French Busher is equal to Dondy before the two eyes of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in Elite League for Adam Kiff's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundi in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
That was the fourth blast between the opponents of this season, as Janets won the previous three matches.
The attack with which Dwayr discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendal McFoul's assistance, and then David Rutherford made two advances, assisted by Bovlier four minutes later.
He was forced to start, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markart helped balance with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to take Jaints before the first break, marking the second round of dinner at the end of the first half.
The housekeepers regrouped and Bushhar re-equipped the chances of a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran have united their efforts to help Nilsen give Dondy first advantage at the end of the second half, as he gave himself and confirmed the winning of the five-gol team in the middle but last half.
Janets, who lost the last four matches from the total five meetings, meets as domatina Milton Kins for their next match on Friday.
A pilot died to make sure that hundreds of lives on the plane can escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after his death, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are unconscious at a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Slovezi on Friday, activating a wave of tsunamis.
The powerful secondary towers continued to defeat the area and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the very third control tower at Muteara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed on the spot to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was moving.
He died in the hospital later.
The air control speaker, Indonesia, Johannes Sirate, said that this solution could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the debris, and to many people it can't be achieved," said Supopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves that reached six meters left Palu, where there was a massive burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the line still touches the body.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's nightmares everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, quoted CNN as saying: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joe Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unconscious after a plane crash in the cabin
The plane that flew with a plane that landed in a pond in the Pacific now reports that a man has been declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the flying aircraft.
In a press release Air Niugini said they can't connect with a passenger from men's pool on Saturday night.
The airline added that they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requirements for more details for passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local people’s ships helped save passengers and crews, after the plane crashed into the water while trying to climb to the island of Chuck.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The planes reported that six passengers were left on Saturday in the hospital, as they were all stable.
The reasons for the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. military forces said the plane had landed in the cabin shortly before the track.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, says the plane has gone very low.
"This is extremely good," says Janes.
Janes says he and the others were able to cross through the deep into the water to reach the emergency exits of the floating plane.
He shared that the Stuartes fell into panic and got baptized, as well as that he suffered a mild headache.
The U.S. Navy forces tell us that mariners remodeling the port near have also helped in the rescue operation by using the overboard boat to cross people to the coast before the plane sinks to about 30 metres of deep water (100 ft).
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that over the last two decades 111 persons have been killed on flights with aeroplanes registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been included in any case.
Analyticals reveal the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his statement on the case-by-case on this Saturday in the retrial against a man who was charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Ministry of Justice witnesses for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phones records to capture the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to ask Sanford.
Saffard stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another difference is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The phone records say they've been dating since week.
Roulette learned that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, she deleted her text messages, her calls and her contact information from her phone.
"He left her out of his life," said Hail.
The protection is planned to start with its final imports on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be presented before the hearings later that same day.

The next blackout?
A bride from New York judge two after the "rastic" message is fired
A woman from New York judges two for being fired for discrimination after she received a wrong message from her mother, who complains she's "the next blackout".
The two refuse to be racists, causing the demand for "destruction".
Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised when she realized that the new baby girl, Jisel Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"WOMAN, THE PRESENT BLOOD," she wrote in a text message to her husband, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman released Mrs. Morris, explaining that the former African-American prostitute had not done the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a salary for one working day after which she was sent home by taxi.
Now Morris judges the two for compensation for the release, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was initially hired, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do this," she said before Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the two claimed that they were not racists, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable act, since they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they tried.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was a mistake?
You're born?
Think about it."
Remarking the need for "failure", Plasco says that his wife was born only two months ago and she was at “very difficult. ”
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the case is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemns both in social networks by condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers were not supposed to feel contact with a talking sword, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted by the public, relates about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun now that we're aware of Padington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write a book for a little ball-player, would feel optimistic about any rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th year of publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family”, she adds that her father has secretly felt proud of the final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-thankful," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's all about having a child who has achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not your job.
I think you used to make Paddington a success this way.
Although it was his creation and fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the benefits to Padington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to meet her on the phone.
After her daughter was kidnapped, she was rushed to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors fought against saving her life.
"He kept calling to say that the situation was really bad that he didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say he's gonna die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Thai, my dear, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart gradually stop acting and leave her system.
She's gone for some time before this and this way it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't get up or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get out of here."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who is still worried about the loss of her daughter, is riding on the plane with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understood," she shared.
"I've raised my head and all the time my tears got stuck.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this whole feeling of co-operation with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Worrying women put cards in order to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Taylor, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew about the smile.
They've always said his smile poisons every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving and found himself in “a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried that this will have some consequences."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards, “to make people know who to go with and who to talk to, even to be a friend.
Don't keep silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphris, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his state.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them, nor did he look at them."
She said that this was a terrible tragedy for them, but they had to handle it: “This opens up a family feast.
It's breaking us up.
But we must keep going and fight."

Bret Kawano's future is under question after the FBI's investigation begins.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited duration and a limited scope – we could combine our efforts," Mr. Fleek said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "fall" despite the party blockade.
Why did Mr. Kawano and his supporters of the Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their disappointment is due to their own moment.
The preliminary elections are only after five weeks – on 6 November – if the Republicans are expected to be not well represented, they will seriously suffer their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kawano, who is working for Mr. Bush at Belia's house and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently members.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidate for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees "small" at Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoted by the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment by Phenyan.
Most North refugees finally get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where they are the longest border with North Korea and pass through more easily than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides both Koreas.
China thinks refugees are illegal migrants, not refugees, as they are often forced to repatriate.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month the heads of state of both sides met in Phenyan for talks focused on the stand-by in the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Unu in Singapore, where they agreed on common lines to work for Korean peninsulas without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be convinced in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way to take the first step unilaterally," Mr. Rei said in a word to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cawano "exterior" and said it wasn't appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority at Congress Nansi Pelosi called the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Kawano "extended" and said he was too unequal to serve in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It was not like I didn't think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call it "extreme," Pelosi said of her reaction to the witness of Kawano before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had made a sexual visit to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavano was very emotional, at moments he almost cried and felt as he discussed his family and academic years.
He also categorically condemned democracies in the Commission, calling the allegations against him "a gross and coordinated attack against personality", organised by Liberals, who are displeased that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi noted that according to it, Cavano's testimony proves that he is not able to work in the Supreme Court, since it has become clear that he is convinced of democracy.
"I think he himself is disqualified by these claims and by the way the Clinton and Democrats are persecuted," she said.
Pelosi refused when asked whether he would try to discriminate against Kawano if he was appointed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only a person entering the Supreme Court but also in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential provisions of the Cavano Act for access to health care or the "Ro v. Weid" case, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In previous hearings Kawano had avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the moment for a stubborn, prudent man to enter the court and expect us to say, "is it not wonderful," Pelosi concluded.
And women have to rule themselves.
It's a basic criticism, after months and years of widespread hunger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Stinham 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I received great help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry but developed her technique, thanks to which she was angry and crying, she says to her roommate, "You may think I'm sad because she's crying.
I'm mad."
And then it just goes on.
I've decided that's great."
Cases are allowed when expressing anger, often because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in office mainly with men, is how one time while I fell apart from inexplicable cruelty, a woman older than me caught me at the door – a stinking guide I've always been a little scared – and she attracted me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be enough to blame you."
Patricia Shröder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an extraterrestrial relationship called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the contest, Mrs. Shröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he would not consider the idea of applying for the president himself.
"It wasn't a good idea," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Snake and Seven Jewess."
Since it's late into the campaign, it's spending money and decides that it won't stay in the race if it's not able to collect $2 million.
The battle has been precipitated for failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would just give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she says she will not continue with an official campaign, she is overwhelmed by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, discontent with the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and you can turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against the sexist that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Shröder as the media reacted.
"Some may think Kleineex are my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave plate?
"She's crying"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were devastating, and while the battle was fast, a difference between the two countries would benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning seal this year, placing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, coal and aluminium.
The biggest rise in pressure has occurred this week with new myths that affect production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax burden on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing turned against new targets with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has been called back on every US hit and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore it.
To force Washington to give up means to surrender to the demands, but to surrender his head publicly before Washington will be too ashamed of Si Djinpin, China's president.
And yet, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China's long-term plan by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political decision, both in Washington and Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in some of the two countries, is actually more dangerous than the observers had recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific officer on issues related to Asia to the New American Security Centre expert group.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said
Syria declared it ready for the voluntary return of refugees and prayers for assistance in the recovery of the war-free country has continued for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulalem pointed out that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's position is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas left by terrorists to return them to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulalem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the recovery of the abandoned state.
But he stressed that there would be no conditional aid or aid from the states that financed the rebels.
Europe won the "Rader Cup" in Paris
The European team won the "Radder Cup" for 2018 as the US team with final score 16.5 to 10.5 of "Le Golf National" in the outskirts of Paris, France.
This is how the United States has had six successive losses on a European country and has not won a "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament after the team led by Dutch Captain Thomas Bourne arrived at the necessary 14,5 points that guaranteed the victory over the United States.
The U.S. Star, Phil Mikelson, who was weak in most of the tournament, sent his first hit on the 16th floor (with "pair" 3) into the water with which he lost his sword against the French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was presented excellently in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance 5-0-0 since the competition took place in the current form after 1979.
American Jordan Spiet lost category with 57-4 players in the European team, located at the lowest in the Ranger – Torbourn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the "Rader Cup".
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participation in the "Rader Cup", became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its activity to 25.5 points this year.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't keep myself.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the money again.
Most importantly, the team is and I am happy that I was able to help," said the developed Garcia after Europe's victory.
He gives his cousin John Ram's staff who won the American League of Tiger Woods with 2&1 on Sundays.
"I'm incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, but I grew up while I watched him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his general balance of radar cap is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players for all time have won 14 big titles – a indicator that only stands for Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties all weekend, except Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf course every day from the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furic shared his disappointment with the team: “I was proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressed a team of Europeans.
There was a fight.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players presented themselves very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the U.S. Professional Golf Association and our Radar Cup Committee and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I'm their captain.
There's no way you can get your opponent's hat off.
We were just played."

According to the Committee, there are reports on conditions for declining growth in the regions of Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this shows a reduction in concentrations.
Water particles with overcrowded red liquids are distributed about 130 miles across the coast, from the northern Pinellas area to the southern district of Lee.
Adults can be seen 10 miles from the Hillsborough coast, but they are less than last week.
The Red River is also observed in the Pasco district.
In the past week there are data on moderate concentrations in the border area or slightly below Pinellas district, low to high concentrations on the Hillsburro district, high concentrations in Manuti district, high concentrations in the vicinity of Sarasota district, moderate concentrations in the Charlotte district, high concentrations in the coast or above and low concentrations in the Collier district.
There is still information about the fireplaces in the Pinellas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
