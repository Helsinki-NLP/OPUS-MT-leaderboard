Large members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with the "Maps"
Some members of the congregation were disappointed by the proposal to change their title to "Members of the Grand Parliament" (MWP).
To that end, the plans have been made to change the name of the congregation in the Grand Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this could become a subject of ridicule.
One labist member of the congregation said his group was worried "because it's breaking up with Twp and Pwp".
For readers van Vels: On a large twp means bubbles, and pwp means output.
A member of the congregation from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" about the change of names, but he noted that there was a small difference between the MWP concept and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of a great word is similar to the pronunciation of a word in Yorkshire English.
The Community Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change of names stated: "The final decision on the descriptions of members of the congregation will, of course, bring their own members."
The Welsh government Act of 2017 granted the congregation an authorisation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals which resulted in great support for the appointment of the Great Parliament.
When it came to the title of members of the congregation, the Commission gave priority to the name of Members of the Grand Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the congregation are reportedly offering alternative proposals, but efforts to achieve consensus could be made more effective to Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft change law within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the way the Community operates, including rules on the disqualification of members of the Community and the Commission's plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians are going out to the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The national vote has been organised in an effort to resolve a multi-tenth-century dispute with a neighboring Greece that has a province called Macedonia.
Atina has long argued that the name of their northern neighbours represents its territory and is strongly opposed to its demands for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Dordje Ivanov, anti-plebistic opposition to the change of name, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, the rapporteurs, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider that the change in the name is the simple price they have to pay for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
The calls at St. Martin were silent while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I've talked to say that there have ever been bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No one or no one today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the quarter-day residents that people go to regularly."
As far as the church is concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The church, he added, could be replaced by state buildings with apartments with people who will not help save the rest of the district shrines.
"The vast majority of people who are going to buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the closure of these churches because it's unlikely that people who will move into these homes will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the metropolitan community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The first white-medium community was settled in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church took over a black community under the leadership of the former John Howard Johnson who led a merchant boy on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed employment or the promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but since Father Johnson's dentists made the plan, they ordered the authorities.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the pride of "the voice of the orphanage".
The expert who played the organs in July called them different: "cultural goods" and "unchangeable historical instruments."
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan has also shown that this is the first organ in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church didn't find a replacement.
What was played in the Church of St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by Episcopal Bishops.
The Bishop’s Administration – the administrative body of the Bishops, composed of church heads – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "try to transfer costs" to the bishop’s office, although the bishop’s administration was not included in the rent of architects and the businessman who sent the bishop.
Some jubilants complained about lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
Aikula has been injured by a 13-year-old during hunting in California.
Aikula attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was hunting the yachts in California on the day of the opening of the boat, officials announced.
Something happened about seven o'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he broke up with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy who called for help and then took him to the group and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was about getting excited because he caught the light, but then he said, "he realized he cried out, 'She touched me!'
She's got me!
His whole key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by a helicopter to Rady's paediatric hospital where his condition is leading as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Captain Larry Giles said in the media interview that the shark has already been observed in that area several weeks earlier, but that it has been established that it does not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper part of the body.
Officials closed access to beach from Ponto Beach in Casablada to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to share cosmetic products in the style of slave houses in which professional assistants work.
As a result of a significant market for beauty in Great Britain of 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing while selling fashion and household equipment on markets, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 retail shops across the country, and will be expanded to more shops next year if they are successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets find ways to use police that are sometimes used for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury's stated that it will double its cosmetic variety by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in sections similar to those in stores like Booths.
The Supermarket will also re-start its Boutique makeup line, since most products will be suitable for vegetables – something that increasingly requires young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop's perfume store will test the sales place in two Sainsbury's shops, from which it was first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the other will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and moving to buy daily low-cost food in local stores means that supermarkets must make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Saninsbury's chain, said that salesmen will increasingly look like slave houses in the supermarket's efforts to restore the hit on the chain with large droplets Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-predominant products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos sales department in hundreds of its shops, and also introduced the Habitat department since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has been unfavourable.
Sainsbury's tested joint agreement with the Boots launch in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended up fighting about the share of the income from the apothec in their sales.
The new strategy came into force three years ago after Sainsbury's sold its 281 rocket company Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It has been said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Saninsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beautiful departments so that we can give our buyers a more pleasant environment.
We've also invested in special-trained colleagues who will be able to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and attractive surroundings and practical locations mean that we are now an inconspicuous destination of beauty markets which sets new standards in relation to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "heavy" after Holly Willoughby retired from the 11 million-pound deal.
The Dragons Day show star, Peter Jones, is "heavy" after television director Holly Willoughby pulled out of agreement with his personal brand of 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV companies
Willoughby doesn't have time for his inner home and extra equipment Truly.
This couple's company is related to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The director of this Morning (37) announced his departure via Instagram.
Holly WIlloughby explained the star of the Dragons' Den Peter Jones show by withdrawing from their profitable interior in the last few days – to focus on its new honorable agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV companies.
Sources reported that Jones was "heavy" when a gold girl on television admitted, during a busy meeting on Tuesday in his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there was no time to dedicate their home and extra equipment to Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced his departure from Britain to one of his weekends at Instagram.
The source said: "Holly Truly put herself at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would guarantee her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was all involved.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a lot of products ready for sale in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's emission leader, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in a wide variety of products, from jewelry and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones (52) joined in March as company director.
Couples go to holiday together and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become Ambassador inside M&S and will replace Anta McPartlina as leader at ITV Emission I'm A Celebrate.
The source near Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He was amazed at the criticism that he could get from the media because of a comment that could be characterized as "non-president" and because of a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much?
Theump told his funny voice "reader of the news."
"I haven't let it go at all."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump announced their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "appropriate response" from the United States on the first steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he insisted, the United States continues with sanctions whose purpose is to keep pressure.
Theump gave much more positive opinion during his speech together.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way from war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim has led to positive results - a resistance to rocket testing, the release of hostages and the return of the post-mortem remnants of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act as presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this whole arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the light in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island of death - dealing hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, the state of national disasters has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear to the knowledge that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is forming a team that will travel to Palu, they are still not sure if the side staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, the national disaster agency portal, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad to see how this country is not prepared for the anger of nature.
Although these canals are built in Acehu, they are not often seen in other parts of the sea.
There was apparently no siren for the queens on the island of Palu, although the warning was in force, so it also led to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents challenges.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship landed in Lombok to provide help to the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but he'll need at least three days to get to the new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian infrastructure and has not saved money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Jokoa's administration while the next year the new elections are expected.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been planted for street fighting by Christian and Muslim groups, who have used swords, spears and rifles, as well as other primitive weapons.
Look: Fudbaler Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has brought in deep-fashioned attacks on the Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a ball from Jherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left and then jumped to the outside statue.
The ball flew high above the penal area turning to the top right corner of the network.
He finally fell over Cape Arizabalga, who was in the jump and jumped into the network.
"It was only to position, to accept the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself more time," Sturrugge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"He saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea took 1-0 in half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard got hit in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker in the fifth attack added the ball to Matthew Kovači before he ran from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic hit fast and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the penal area.
Hazard was faster than defense and ended up near the station putting it on the left leg of Liverpool Becker's network.
Liverpool is fighting against Naples in the Lig Champion group phase at three o'clock on Wednesday at the stadium of Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the League of Europe in three hours on Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims rose in 832, a state disaster agency reported early Sunday.
A lot of people were reported in the ruins of the building that destroyed the earthquake of 7.5 forces that occurred on Friday and raised the walls high and up to 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the rest of the damaged buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) after his wife died
The murder investigation was initiated after the women's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-olds were found out at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in the street of John Street, and a thirty-two-year-old man was arrested suspected of committing murder.
The police called people who were close to seeing or hearing something to call.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early phase, but I call on everyone who were near John Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken some cameras on the car control boards, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
The police department confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and found it at home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the front to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said they were in the process of informing the family of the victims.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed out of text when he discovered what happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to return in.
They heard a cop told one man that a whole area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She repeated "this is so terrible."
At 14 hours two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next.
A large number of police officers were inside the police corridor monitoring the state building.
All who have any information are invited to directly contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, which refers to case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's status in Parliament has become the latest reminder of the "historic review" debate.
Its removal would represent a move of justice due to the dispersion of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, which were carried out by the Taliban by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society's proposal, Mr Cricka, described as "the madness" and "the attempt to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the context of the current debate on the removal of the status, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's image before the palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order it, nor did he practice iconophobia during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be victimized by the work of his cousin Thomas of the previous age.
The great exhibition Cromwell author Sir William Hamo Thorney Croft is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the history of the figure that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwella is considered by many to be more than the end of the 1990s than today, to protect Parliament from external pressure, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is exactly the subject of permanent historical discussion.
What is certain is that a conflict from the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord's guardian are also worthy of honor and mention."
The killer's pig has caused death injuries to the Chinese farmer.
The pigs attacked and killed farmers at a market in South-West China, reported local media.
A man for whom only he knew he was named Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and buried blood in a pigeon at a market in the city of Liupanshui in the district of Guizhou, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Swinjar was preparing for the outbreak of the vaccine on June 30, 2005, at Xining in Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big man pig with blood around his mouth.
Forensic research has confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds caused fatal injury to the farmer, as reported in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said a relative who was represented by the name Wu, transferring Guiyang Evening News.
The security record shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong either to Yuan or to his relative.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and market owners are reportedly negotiating a death penalty.
Although rare, cases of dog attacks on people were also noted earlier.
The pig attacked his wife and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a heavy 650 - pound [650 L] pig fell in love with a large farmer with his tractor while his wife didn't scare him and drove him away.
After the pigs ate the Ogon Farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "cooker".
"They're just playing.
They like the stickers, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of Rosa's wounds bring scattered bullets to the southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Urgan Rosa failed to move over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods to the northern part of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The Russian hurricanes first category reached a speed of 85 miles per hour from five o'clock in the morning after sunrise on Sunday, while 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia was located in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, I am formed in the Pacific and move east and west across the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin north of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical investment together with the next wave will create scattered floods in the southwestern over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, noses and possible cliffs in the desert.
The high tropical investment will result in floods that will eventually reach between 2 and 3 inches per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a rapid deterioration of weather conditions and typical expansion of tropical rain.
Flights of sand in the desert would be extremely mindless with the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could result in divided rivers in canyons, and hailstorms in local winds and sandstorms.
The next time I bring local floods to the parts of southern California.
There are possible total dropouts from over half the inch, which could cause nose and neck cramps.
This will be the first rain season in the region.
The room will arrive in Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes spreading later on Monday and Tuesday.
The flowers will also reach Four Corners on Tuesday, and will continue on every Wednesday.
In October, there can be great fluctuations of temperature across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, and the trophies remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short intervals.
There is a great example of dramatic differences in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer temperatures will again try to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be heated in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from around 80 degrees south to north-east.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast of time reveals a large potential for temperature above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Bretta Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony of Bretta Kavanaugh before the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assaults that reportedly occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political unrest continues, with issuers interrupting regular emission due to the latest fraud on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI agency on a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate judicial commission that it's safe to join Kavanaugh's pipe and try to break up at a high school party.
In a passion story, Kavanaugh said that the percentage was safe that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other networks that issued it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with counting people who are following transportation from the office.
To make things better, it's a public similar to one who follows football elimination matches or Oscars.
Fox News Channel whose editors gave support to the name Kavanaugh, led by other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, from Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, reported from the Netherlands.
Interest is high and after hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of the Memorial Republican has issued a statement to vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS network cameras have noted the photos of the prosecutor who were shouting at him after he tried to get into the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He's been looking at it for a few minutes while he was being hurt by moving his life to CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him: 'You have power until so many women are weak'.
Flake said his office issued a statement and said it before the elevator closed, that there was more to say at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and television networks had a live transfer hours later, while the judicial commission voted whether to follow the appointment of Kavanaugh Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the so-called next week, on what the minority calls for.
Fleke killed some of his friends, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coon and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and to attract national interest in a Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview to which she was present at the headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chechers plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that Great Britain and the EU take customs one of the other "all absurd".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in a death shot that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball club.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned under the charge of a second-stage murder, reported from the police administration of Baton Rouge.
Officials published videotapes between Sims and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his eyes during the race.
The police took out the crime scene and reported they found Simpson's DNA on them, says the WAFB network channel CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he admitted he had killed Wade.
His guarantee is $350,000. He said a lawyer.
The Mortgage of the Eastern Region of Baton Rougea issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a gun shot from the head and neck.
The department reported that the services belong to the police working group for the Luizian refugees, the criminalist state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local authorities who helped them during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU club Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agency for "maritality and difficulty in justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6-foot attacker and a 6-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also gambling at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps by sword.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade announced that the team was "in despair" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we always care about," said Wade.
Vulcan emits dust in Mexico City
Pepeo, who's bluffing the volcano Popocatepetl, has arrived in the southern quarters of Mexico's capital city.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after the volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas and dust emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was following more floods and storms.
Social media images depict the thin layers of ashes covering winded cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the main city since the earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police faced Catalan separatists and saw the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the witnesses, the supporters of independence, met with a special police assignment when thousands of people joined in contravention demonstrations due to the marking of the year of the polarising Catalan referendum on the outbreak.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police station, threw them into the dust with eggs and colors, putting dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, they were shot and attacked by a police officer who used pendres to get a fight.
For more than an hour, independence officers have been scanning "There's no forget, no forgiveness" and they've been meeting with the Union's representatives who called themselves "The Life of Spain".
Forty people received medical treatment for minor injuries suffered in protests, local press reports.
Tensions are still high in the region which has been allocated for independence year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a large majority, although the output was low because the anti-machination opponents fought against the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting against violent conflicts in the voting areas of the region.
Groups talking about independence campaigned on Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations are still held, but they've changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents pay for happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we're in the script now," he said.
Although they carried out a key but close victory at the local elections last December, the Catalan parties seeking independence had difficulty holding back because some of their most famous leaders were in a self-contained exile or in prison, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a statement for police support on the phone, said that politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting all stressed out," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned since the end of last year, published his candidate in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backlog of democratic values and repressions that the Spanish authorities have intended for us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after they hit the car in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after more than one car hit the house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday about 19:30 p.m. by the British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said it was damaged by the gate as well as by the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point on the car was shot out of the car.
Menge hit Livingston won from 1:0 against Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge was to win for Livingston.
Advanced Livingston surprised Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerard at the 18th Ibrox club.
Gol Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was compared to Hibernian elsewhere.
Gerard's club has not noticed any victory in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-class Hearts for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will launch the Becha Rapid into the sword of the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has passed a series of six-ball league victories, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against the guests she missed
Holt's team had to be in charge much before they got naked because their direct game was very problematic for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went through the hole, then the attempt by Alan Lithgrow went beyond the hole after he pulled out to get the ball that Craig Halkett put on his head.
It was up to the owners to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the free attackers.
And that's how it's reached a key goal.
He was convicted of a free attack on Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson created an opportunity for Mango, who received the ball and hit it from the middle of the prison.
By that time, Rangers were dominated by the possession of the ball, but the defense property remained intact and naked Liam Kelly didn't have a lot of trouble.
That painting continued in another half-time, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the football of Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot across from another free strike for Livingstone.
The Croseves arrived in the prison area of Livingstone and were constantly protected, while the two sentences they sought – one after the fall against replace player Glenna Middleton – and the other because of the game’s hand – were not assigned.
"Fenomial Games" Livingstone – analysis
The BBC newspaper Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
The famous game and the result of Livingstone.
They've all been great up to one, and they're still losing their expectations on their way out.
Their style of games and players have probably not changed since their return to the top, but great rewards belong to Holt who gives the team energy from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga didn't give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall peace through all his sword.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were from time to time under Gerard's flag, they didn't reach that level.
There were no final hits – just one pass through the household lines – and this is the kind of invitation for Rangers to wake up in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelna
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany, whose aim is to improve the relationship between the NATO Union.
They have dealt with issues such as human rights, freedom of prints and Turkey's EU entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks live outside Turkey.
The police took security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of witnesses against Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also loud, judging Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to grant him a welcome visit to the country.
Two stories reflect a division in the opinions of a guest who is praised by some German Turks as hero, while others point to what he is an autocrat.
Traffic accidents in Deptford: Bicyclelist died in co-operation with the car
The biker died in a co-operation with a car in London.
It arrived in the vicinity of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street street, on the road to Deptford, on the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 by the British time.
The driver stopped and intervened by an emergency team, but the man died on the spot.
The attack occurred several months after the other biker died in an accident in which the driver left the accident site, in the Children's Street street, which was about a mile away from the place on Saturday accident.
From the London police they reported working on identification of victims and family information.
Streets are closed, buses are moved, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security prisons for men, reported from the Prison Office.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday about 09:30 a.m. by the British time and still last.
A special staff member "Tornado" has been invited to work peaceably in which eight guards are involved in one wing of the prison.
Officials have received fewer facial injuries and help is provided on their face
The police officer of the prison administration said: "We have arranged a specially trained prison staff dealing with the incident that is happening in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance because of the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for it and that they may be subjected to prison sentences."
Long Lartin prison is located in more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison administrator was applied to hospital treatment after his arrest by the prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called into prison because of serious irregularities in which staff were attacked by billiard bullets.
Uragan Rosa threatens to swim Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas covered by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen very likely at the beginning of next week while hurricane Rosa passes through the desert south-west crossing, carrying her risk of flooding.
National weather management has already issued warnings for floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and Eastern Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix has been tweeting that only "ten tropical cycles since 1950 have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression in 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is an orphan who was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent projections of the National Centre for Uregans predict 2 to 4 inches of fall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In the rest of the desert south-west, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will probably be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of flooding, Rosina rain could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be of benefit because they are currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought control agency, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by extreme drought, another highest category," air.com reported.
First on his way from Urgan Rosa to a resort on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of the 85 miles per hour wind current on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and will move from 12 miles per hour.
The waves will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and will therefore begin to evaporate.
It is therefore expected that Mexico will be hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Flushing in parts of Mexico could be very strong and can pose a great risk of flooding.
"The total fallouts from three to six inches are expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonore, and perhaps up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico with the power of the tropical storm before arriving in Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or her remnants is the great floods in Baja California, the North-West Sonori and the South-West American desert," they said from the National Centre for Uregans.
It is expected that these floods will cause life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts, as well as cliffs in the mountain regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and two-year-old men were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old was found out in Somerset.
The teenagers found a wounded man near the streets of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 a.m. after the British time.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a stable condition.
Seventeen-year-old, two-eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in Radstock, reported from the Avon and Somerset police.
Officials are calling for those who have any video of what's happening on their mobile phone.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh "has endured substantiation and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and unsanitary tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wellling, West Virginia.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh "has endured substantiation and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination procedure.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, strong and emotionally opposed Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw great, quality and courage" Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most recent legal agreements of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President touched on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the significance of the Republican exit at the mid-mission elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I don't apply for myself, I actually do." He said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates on all sides."
Theump claims that democrats are trying to "oppose and interfere".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, the High Commissioner of the Republican Party for CNN said.
Hundreds lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow
At least 384 people died, many of them gathered in huge waves that hit the beaches, when great earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) hit the coast in the morning, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found their way.
Kunami followed after the earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat from the tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still engaged in their work on the beach and didn't run away immediately, and they were upset," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency, said in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he wore cars, balloons, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that he traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers an hour (497 miles per hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people got drunk on trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people are evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
Photos from the air, published by the disaster agency, show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and a dam with water.
Supports continued to strike the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area in which 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced that the energy of large earthquakes on Friday was 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city that was located on the edge of a long, narrow line increased the force of tsunamis, they said.
He described the damage as "a scale" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
Several victims' bodies were found under the ruins of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 persons were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be more than 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Doghrea, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely cut off without any information" from Donghre, Nugro said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," said the Red Cross in the press, adding that their personnel and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records shared on social networks show men on top of the street who panickingly warn people of the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the wall of the water hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters team could not immediately confirm the identity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that cuts communication around Palu by crushing the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased by over 800.
It's so bad.
Although World Vision staff certainly came from Dongree to Pala, where employees were located in the camps raised in the office courtyard, they witnessed the signs of road destruction, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so bad.
Even when relief groups began to take the first steps in mitigating disasters, the charge was that foreign high-quality humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign resources, goods and people is only possible if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the Ukrainian level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open for international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls on Palo on Friday, friends and family are still hoping that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and their thrilling story in this natural disaster will be brought to light.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins near her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subbandon, an Indonesian paragliding team trainer, trained two missing paraglider eyes of Asian games completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandage, were his students.
"As an old paragliding team member I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how it was hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel spread across the halls of the paraglider's parade of whatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey box instead of two blue boxes.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thefts took $26,750 during the filling of the banknotes in the Newport on the Levee complex
On Friday morning, police reports in Newport stole $26,750 from Brick's worker who filled the banknotes in Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car emptyed his wallet in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote to the press.
While he was busy, another man "stitched behind Brin's staff" and stole a bag of money he was supposed to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, standing in the press, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper my change in Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He published a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known under the Y nickname for some time and has used the name for the title of his eight album, which was published in June.
Until the change came before his show on Saturday Night Live, where promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who rejected the "Emotional Reasons" performance," said the author of the show.
In addition to the summary of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio director Big Boye.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
She was born from Kanya, which means only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of what we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without quotes and big words.
AMLO in Mexico swore that he would not use an army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that he will never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the fifteenth anniversary of the blood transfusion against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use his army to defeat the Mexican people."
The army fired at peaceful demonstrations on the market on 2 October 1968 even killed 300 people while left-wing students moved into Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its cost of research in that field, says the investor and artist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after different parts of the American authorities published an announcement on artificial intelligence, although the United States does not generally have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China announced its plan: their goal is to be the first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by the year 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new experiment in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Bilateral funds could double the chances that next much will be achieved in the field of artificial intelligence of the United States, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superies of Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most impressive art intelligence companies, Face+.
He was at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s and was later the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google border.
Lee has given recognition to earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defence research projects and asked when they planned the following competitions on which future spectators could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to invest enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"The Chinese academic leaders don't take us away, they do corporate work," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired great individuals from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of artificial intelligence by the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Division has formed the United Nations Art Intelligence Centre, which seeks to involve partners from industry and academic communities, and White House has announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Art Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislation which has tried to form the Commission's national security for artificial intelligence over the months is not taken into account.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on the change in the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a step that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that would block their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory under the name of Macedonia, claims that the name of their northern neighbours represents its territory and has placed a veto on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the celebration in Macedonia.
President Jórdje Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign pointed to the question whether the referendum would go out of at least 50 per cent of what would be necessary to make the referendum more relevant.
The question on the voter list was: "Are you part of the NATO Union and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The so-called amendments, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that this price that Macedonia, one of the countries, has been born as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Oliver Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would be led by the results of the vote and that the outcome would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority would be required in Parliament to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there was no reports of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at the latest parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the voters were elected.
"I've come to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said Dóose Tanevski (62), a voter in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in the Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way to membership in the NATO Union and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small bin and pulled chairs in front of the tent that those who were going to fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top heads, not the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, with unemployment rate higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 percent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after listing.
He said the result "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says it will take part in the referendum between 30 and 43% of the voters – which is below the necessary output.
According to a second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote "for".
A 50 per cent plus one vote is required for the referendum to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious hit by the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton and reaches the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling solved the defenses of Brighton in the victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It worked very easy when Aguero got naked in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker got a ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defense players Brighton before he was on the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green shirts.
He ran around one defence player and he was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first shot in the prison space to return the fight to Agure, who ruled the right-hand hero Brighton Matthew Ryan with a move on the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," said the trainer of the City Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's right.
We're glad he got naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers an initial priority in the Premier League.
He reached the goal in 29 minutes.
In that action Aguero received a ball deep on Brighton's part of the field.
He added Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched a couple of times before he sent Sterling to the hole.
The sky striker threw the ball into the network before he got out of the field.
The city is fighting against Hoffenheim in the Lig champion's group phase at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without a competitive character against Rockies.
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the competitive Cherzer is hoping to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if they are Rockies, who have a game of advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still playing.
Rockies even have a direct pass to win from 5:2 against Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we haven't played for anything, we can at least go out to the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be likely at the highest level in relation to all other years.
Why do I not want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team on Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherser drop in that situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will be thrown on Sunday when he usually leaves.
The night from Washington runs 18:7 this season for the average cost of 2,53, 300 stalls in 220 2/3 inings.
The trumpet was held together in West Virginia.
The President briefly turned to the situation around the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the Republican exit to elections on half of the mandate.
"All we've done will be on the stakes in November.
We're five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – although I didn't actually apply for a candidate because I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical democracies, that's happening right now.
And they're determined to return power using all possible means, see evil, dirty games.
He does not care who will suffer, who will go beyond their power and control, and who will have power and who will have control over what they want, and we will not give them."
Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "relief and harassment."
"And you saw it in the past four days," he said, calling democracy "warm, evil, evil and dishonest."
He mentioned a democratic senator and a member of the Senate justice commission, Diane Feinstein, on behalf of which moved the public to vote.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. It was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The lab party no longer accepts different views.
It's not fair to those who express their opinion
When the Moments activists at my local border voted to censor me, I wasn't even surprised.
Finally, I am the last in a series of lab members who have been told they haven't come, and all because we have reached our opinion.
My colleague from Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors have criticized me for not having sex with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems with which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
An announcement from a meeting of the limit of a labist party in Nottingham East held on Friday's vote "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local labist member of Parliament, Friday evening meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not that way and the promise of "more kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether that ever happened.
It has become more and more evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the laboratory party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues whom I believed to share similar political views began to expect me to make 180-step rounds and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was about national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – this is accompanied by a wave of social abuse on social networks, calls for removal from the party, political judgments of the centre and tells me I shouldn’t be in a labist party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because comments directed to me are mainly political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and the decision of a colleague who wears a kiss of sexist or racist offenses every day, but doesn't come back.
What disappointed me most most in this political period was how these levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the lab party should have its culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer parties that accept different views and every vote of mistrust or change of the rules of selection of the party is difficult.
I've got a lot of advice and the last two years, they've been talking me to get my head up, I'm less loud and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the lab party 32 years ago, driven by a lack of government Prime Minister Thatcher because my primary school students had literally begun, I have struggled to wish for better public services to those who are most in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and areas of non-compliance with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to point out that, when the country comes to Brexit to threaten households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand why someone would lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But the main message I have is not directed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my electoral unit, whether members of the lab party or not: I am proud that I serve you and I promise you that the threat of removal from the party or the political hypocrisy will not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unaffected Air at the top
Two late attempts may well have produced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a deserved victory in this exciting game of days at Tennt's Premier League.
They're on top of the table now, the only unbeated by ten teams.
In the end, the domestic team won the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as a large number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"We're already tested in the games and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru is honored, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than us."
Try Grant Naderson in 14 minutes that transformed Frazier Climo, gave Ayru the advantage, but he was a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who Warriors let to play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerous advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted attempt.
The climate of the penile increased Ayra's leadership before, just before the mid-term, he managed to turn himself into a single attempt to hit the result from 17:5 for Ayr in the mid-term.
But Melrose started well in the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot into a five-pointer.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knotta, which they carried out on the shipments, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose re-uses a number of superpowers with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin after a period of intense pressure.
However, the owners returned and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card due to the fall over the climate without a ball. MacPherson got a touch down from the punishment of the drawing behind the coming Ayra mold.
Climo turned, as it did almost from the beginning of the course, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's strike in the prison area and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five attempts at home.
The Still Game Series Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Series Star, Ford Kieran, prepares for a transition to the supplier industry after learning that it is appointed as director of licensed restaurants.
Fifty-year-old Jack Jarvisi plays in a popular BBC series for which he writes a scenario and plays with his long-term partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nine seasons would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglinga.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Aposomorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper insisted that Kiernan wanted to join "increasing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the sea resort in La Paz.
In public buildings the oceanscopal of the flag is being seen.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
The return of the exit to the sea is our obligation."
The division of Bolivia’s continent is still a strong memory of the lake that has been lost in the use of Chile in the blood spilling around natural resources at the age of 19 – as well as the scarcity of refishing the Pacific.
These hopes may be the greatest in the last few decades while Bolivia is expecting the international court's trial of justice in the first five years of the Council.
"Bolivia has caught the flag, in the spirit of unity and courage, and of course she expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the trial of the international court of justice on large-scale screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for Bolivia's benefit and claim that – after the decades of Greek negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of the home-based family, who is facing a controversial struggle for the next year's re-election, also has a major role when it comes to the trial that will be held on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that it will change little if it decides.
The United Nations seating body in the Netherlands is unable to assign Chilean territory and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the trial is only six months after the latest arguments have been heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have been behind him.
"The problem of going out at sea has taken over the current Bolivian authorities for themselves," Zarate said.
Morales' combat rhetoric has killed the rest of Chilean good will, it's out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at one time, but it will be very difficult to keep those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "the greatest opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "set a point of 139 years of non-responsibility to foreign satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most popular Latin American presidents – uses the issue of seagoing as a political trap.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to go out on the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to realize that we need to change the past."
North Korea says it won't come to disarmament until they can't trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not withdraw nuclear weapons until they believe in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to respect data promises during the summit in Singapore between the opposing leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the border to re-initiate nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Unn from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and resistance to the US declaration that the Korean war is ever ending will throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is generally skeptical when it is about the seriousness of Pjongjanga with regard to the withdrawal of a nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare another summit of Kim and Trump.
The latest line of large hats that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, you're in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of huge hats on their spring and summer 2019 magazines and introduced everything into the Paris Week of Fashion.
This summer's Instagram was won by extremely ineffective hats, and these designers showed their impressive creations in fashion.
The most striking Valentine's piece was a headlined hat with a wide pernatery area that had swallowed the heads of the model.
Among the other glamorous additions, there were rubies with rough stone, magic hats, and even pineapples, but their names are not to keep your head from cold.
Tom Browne also introduced a collection of magic masks and that's exactly at the time of the Night of the Witch.
Many of the funny masks had their noses and were more like Hannibal Lecter than they were at high fashion.
One creature looked like a rosary equipment with diesel and masks, and the other reminded of the cornet with frozen ice cream.
If you are among those who follow the trend of attention, you will have happiness.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after "La Bombe", a broken hat with two steps from two steps that have been seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult brand that designed this very inflexible hat that crossed the social networks sent another great creature on the track — a broken beach bag that is almost as large as the model it wore.
Zagasitonaranjast bag of raffia and white leather lunch was featured detailed Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 in the Paris Week of Fashion.
The famous styler Luke Armitage said to the FCCC: "I expect great hats and bags for the beach will arrive at the store during the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-managed fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is of key importance to citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for outstanding academic achievements, and this has continued to be a new set of outstanding results in studies in 2018, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school that represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seeks to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, chosen careers and a place in society of the world’s citizens.
As a educational sector that can think and implement its own teaching plan and program, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable selection objects of praise in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, he'll never get it.
If you talk to him in his language, it's his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the results of this year's examination, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest transient evaluations in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages received an A evaluation at the final secondary school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received an A assessment from the Mandarin language at the final test in the secondary school, while 72 per cent of those who learned German, 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of those who learned Spanish also received an A assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural science, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that in 17 percent of the reason employers pointed to the difficulties in filling jobs was the shortage of those who know foreign languages.
So knowledge of foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
In addition to more potential jobs for which foreign language knowledge is needed, this skill is needed in a world of globalization.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for the rest of his life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically set up a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to yourGo's survey of more than 4,000 British people in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough to conduct a conversation while French was the only language that speaks bidigital percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in learning foreign languages is important for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in development economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to the language they learn.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will translate languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be several languages from which he will be able to choose in independent schools, with an expert training staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need for success regardless of their future.
At this time, it cannot be ignored that in the global business environment, language is key to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will Debt for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first show for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play on Sunday in a pre-sessional match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training this week, James asked for plans in six games during President Lakers.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-session swords to prepare," he said.
Drumpo's collection in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of election groups tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five group banned in the following week including visiting friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote is waiting to be completed in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's collection in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is banned for seven hours tonight after the Eastern Time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch a crowd of Trump in West Virginia under the transfer of life to YouTube.
The trumpet will probably talk about the hearings this week regarding the nomination of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which he was pressured by a sexual harassment charge, and the expected vote in Senate has been postponed for seven days before the FBI is conducting the investigation.
But the ultimate goal of this series of groups is to help the Republicans achieve a better outcome in November.
Thus, from President Trump's campaign, it was said that this week's groups are being held to "give energy to volunteers and representatives while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters information.
"Congress Control is so key to its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," said the Reuters portal of Trump's campaign that he refused to present.
Detained in Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's collection could collect posters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
There will be a second visit to West Virginia on Saturday this month to Trump, the country in which it won over 40 percent points in 2016.
The trumpet is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is not well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to get him a rating in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
Ryder buy 2018.: The US team has shown the fight to keep hope before a single match on Sunday
After three single sessions, Thursday afternoons may be exactly what was needed for this Ryder purchase.
Well, it's a very well-founded concept in sports, but one of those in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think when he's back?
"They led six points, and now four can be said to be on our side now," Jordan Spieth said on his way.
Europe, of course, has a advantage, four points more, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot of what gives them encouragement, between the rest of Spietha and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points from the four possible.
Spieth was great from the first to the last hit and led by his example.
The cheerleaders became more and more vocal during his rounds to finally play a key hit for unsolved results in the fourth sword when he and Thomas stayed for two after two.
His final hit with a 15-rup sword is expected to be a similar blow, to those who reflect the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to give everything out of yourself and take care of your sword," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points from Spietha and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the principal story of Ryder's purchase.
It's unusual, but an inexhaustible European couple got all four swords and no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play the gods of the attackers on Saturday morning, and they ran away on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far and the way they exchange energy with the secular audience has established them as the main favorites on Sunday and no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could bring potential European win as the sun goes down over the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ruled Sergey Garcija, a hero game with four balls that morning when he played with Alex Noren.
One divine strike and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they did not even succeed.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to watch the approach because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give and what they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great advantage before the end of the day, but this session has shown four times that the US team has a desire to fight in which some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's bath
Europe will finally enter Ryder's shop with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in the game with four matches and four-quarters, it has achieved the advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first brought two victories over the unsatisfied Tiger Woods, especially the recent results of the Le Golf National Club on four points.
European Thomas Bjorna in the fight to return the trophies that lost in the Hazeltin golf club two years ago, dominated the unpredictable Americans in the morning game with four rounds and won a series of 3:1.
The United States has given greater resistance to the tournament of four, winning two shots, but they could not reduce the remainder.
Jim Fury's team has to win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European debater who won four points together, while he and Molinari, called "Mollwood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second couple in Ryder's history who won four points in the first four matches.
After losing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four ball games, they were well-compounded and ruled by the heavily armed Woods and American debater Bryson Dechambeau with more vulnerabilities 5:4.
Woods, who jumped through two bullets on Saturday, was flashing at the moment, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and sevens.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning game with four matches, returned with his partner Henrik Stanson to the tournament on Thursday and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third in the world.
But Europe didn't everything follow the plan of this pleasant day in the southwestern part of Paris.
The three winners of the main tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose the victory from 2:1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls, to later return and win Paulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in the quarter, after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder's history did some team come back after the rest of the four points before a single match, although Fury's side is a protected title, enough unsolved result to keep the trophies.
After two days on the other side, however, it seems that they could not carry out the attack on Sunday.
North Korea says "no talk" about one-sided disarmament if there is no trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the promotion of sanctions is producing its mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not at all unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as the interruption of nuclear and rocket testing, the demolition of nuclear policy and the promise that it will not multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there's no proper US response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no mention of the first one being single-minded."
Although Ri repeated known North Korea's allegations against Washington "proceded" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the significance of its statement was that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pjongjang did earlier.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting held between the current US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea seeks the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also listened to calls to ease international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States does not give up ‘denuclearization first of all’ and increases the level of pressure on sanctions in order to achieve its goal in force, even countering the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can cast us on our knees is the empty dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the extended sanctions produce our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader was talking about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister held three meetings between Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If we negotiate this issue about denuclearization with South Korea, and not with the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such an unexplained position."
However, Ton Riovag's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when at the UN General Assembly he said it was inevitable to hit an American field rocket in North Korea after "Mr. Zli President" Trump called Kim "racetesh" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which had threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take the steps of disarmament, but said that much more must be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea pursues denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set a time frame for this, saying: "If necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strictly and unconditional until the full, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously supported the sanctions against North Korea which have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to make it impossible to finance the programme of nuclear and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rij van Generale of the UN and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that progress was made, and North Korea condemned him after only a few hours because of his "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would detonate the rocket polygon as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "relevant measures" that require security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are going to the course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is aimed at making students more dreams in an effort to exploit the increasingly popular learning culture game "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students of the leading university in the world are often unaware of their basic concerns.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and hospital specialist Brigham and Women's, created a course he considers to be the only one in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after he spoke about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why do you just say this to me now, in my retirement year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream was — which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course that this year holds for the first time provides students with a basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improved their overall state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
A single course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on the school for coffee, snacks, cake and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the effects of lack of sleep on the athletic performance and meaning of the routine before bedtime.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons motivates participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the student's behavior temporarily.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects there are on your decision to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of the "exploited night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to a lack of sleep becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against high kilograms, since due to a lack of sleep the brain is going through the cooling system, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a nine-year-old student of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler figure out a course after he attended one of his lectures during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to lie about his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be required by all postgraduates to pass a similar study programme before the competition institution is present.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting alarms on time for sleep and wake up and that they take account of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emits electronic screens and LED lighting and can interfere with the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Winning goal is the defeat of Gerard team
The Rangers experienced another depressive defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent a team of Russians to Steven Gerard at 1:0 from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February triumph from 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holta hired Gerard as manager only another defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the missing leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago, and the uninspired position of Rangers never came close to the equation.
While the Rangers now fell into six places, Livingston jumped into the third and behind were Hibernia just because of the difference in size.
Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show his help when he was hit by an object from the side.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that stopped Ayr and placed himself in the semifinal Betfred bathroom.
On the other hand, Holt was awarded for the same eleven Livingstone players who last week took the Hearts Point and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents on every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little missing to reach the goal just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle-field player missed a great chance and jumped by the goal.
A deep free strike by Keaghan Jacobss then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow just managed to jump by the corner, the end of the statue.
The Rangers were able to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have got a pen in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless cooperated, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombians.
The Rangers only got two hits on the goal in the first half of the first half, but the former Golman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, refused to hit the head of Lassane Coulibaly and stole the shot that led to Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone at 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of power during the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if it wasn't for any other reason, then for the hard work.
The Rangers couldn't choose with a deep free strike of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard responded to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and the replacement almost gave the result when a wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly touched his line and blocked him.
Livingston, however, continued to point out guests to play just the way it fits them, with the long play of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase priority in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well held up and defended Jacobs' attack so that then Lithgow would send the ball from the corner to the corner.
The replacement player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another pen when he joined Jacobs, but Thomson didn't respond again.
Almanah: Immigrant of Geiger's Count
And now, the station from our "Sunday Morning" German: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago... the day of being physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an exception that will in time become a device known as Geiger's calculator.
Besides being one of the main opponents of science, Geiger's number has its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Call Coronada" film, where they played the most amazing Cuban scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's calculator, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these listeners, you can hear the effects of atoms in your ears by means of radioactivity in minerals."
Evans said, "Yes, it's bullshit!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new anti-blood vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" criminal cells
A new anti-blood vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" criminal cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches an immunological system to recognize harmful cells during therapy
The procedure includes the introduction of immunological cells from patients and their transformation into the laboratory
So they can "see" the protein that's common in many types of cancers, and then they're resuscitating.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of a woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize criminal cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the introduction of immunological cells from patients, their processing into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2 and their re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Small Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth in several types of carcinomas" including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the administration of immunological cells from patients and "learning" of the same target of small cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West kept a tight voice of support to the trumpet, wearing MAGA hats, after his show in SNL.
He wasn't doing well.
Kanye West was interviewed at a study during the Saturday Night Live show after a great event in which US President Donald Trump praised him and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After the execution of his third song called Ghost Town, and during the evening he wore a hat with the title "Make America the Great", he insulted Democrats and once again spoke about his support of Trump.
"How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I care about racism, I'd have been moving from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with a jump in which Matt Damon played and the Hollywood star scoffed at Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it's not issued, the West speech video has been shared by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to smile at West by setting up a camera.
West was also sorry to publish that it was hard behind his neck because of the hat.
"They hit me behind the wheel.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They've got me!
And then they say to me that I'm pregnant," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went on: "Do you want to see how it looks?" He added that "to be Superman's plague because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments called for public cheering almost twice, and SNL's members were apparently met, he took Variety, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio has been completely silent."
The West came as a replacement for Arian Grande, whose former partner, reper Mac Miller, passed a few days ago.
The West has confused many with the performance of the songs and hunts it broken into Perrier's bottle.
Westa supported the head of the PPSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not calling yourself into trouble."
But the director of Karen Hunt's show tweeted that the West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as I'm going to buy his music or clothes or support his "art") for whom I believe he has embraced and spread the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he "will be known by the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Fellow Reper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course a quiet music legend Prince has changed his name in symbol, and then in "the artist previously known as Prince".

Forty-five-year-old is charged with attempted murder after a man was released at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be discussed by the Public Prosecutor.
The star of the series "Games of the Past", Kit Harington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role in Jon Snow, who is a fighter in violent medieval fantasy, HBO serial game adventure.
However, the actor (31) turned to the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that children are very often considered to be cruel in order to be respected.
In a statement for Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of the toxic cat culture in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a partner from the game of Leslie Rose (31), admitted that he had "a strong need" to forget this problem.
"I personally have a pretty painful question – what have we done wrong with the representation of men?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be part of the responsibility for the spread of toxic culture by showing figures representing men.
He continued: "What is born, and what is the matter of growth?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to get involved in certain men's behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause it's obvious something went wrong for young people.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the performances or the series of games after its end of the following summer, saying he "has finished with war fields and horses".
Kit will be playing in Sam Shepard True West from November, talking about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks it's what he's known to his wife Rose's best thing that happened in the game series of adventures.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she has given me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a loving partner of Kitto's cousin Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's prize.
A couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new cases of 14%
China reported a 14% drop in new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are transferred by means of sexual relations, which has been changed in relation to the previous state.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is very widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative understanding in the country, 70–90% of men who have sexual relations with men at the end of marriage with women.
The virus is often transmitted because of inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs within the framework of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters rejected the claim that one of her staff published data on republican senators, condemning "hazardous lies" and "confirmation theories"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters rejected the claim that one of her staff published personal data from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of these legislators.
A Democrat messenger from Los Angeles claims that these claims are plagiarists and websites of "the ultra-denominational wing".
"Ladies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh.
The information was published at some point after three senators were investigating Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication related to the Waters office and published information on its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims – is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of these information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly appealed to the online court, which also issued by the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleisher.
"This denial smells like rage," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperature required for Congress members.
When someone accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be a joke.
He must not probate the reasons of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleisher clearly corrected Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Kavanaugh's democratic judge, who was accused of being too angry to listen on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was asked to move Waters to the middle of the mandate, also announced via Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said her office warned "the relevant competent authorities and the judicial authorities of these false claims".
"We will make sure that the starters are discovered," she continued, "and that they are in line with the law for all their procedures that are unstable and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English film again in action – young spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone through the tradition to look for a subtitles about Brexit in each new British film, which can also be applied to this French series of satirical action comedy on Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to the 2011 screen with "Johnny English: born again".
Will ironic autosatises about how we are apparently useless to be a new export opportunity for a nation?
In any case, deaf, incapacitated Johnny English of the rubber face has had a new opportunity to cover something – in which his name is more than all of it says that it is a general comical creation designed for a cinematographic audience whose English is not a native language.
It's, of course, about a bloated secret agent who, despite the bizarre demands on the top glamour, wears a little Clouseau, the Miss Bean tournament and that boy's dead man who played only one note under the theme music of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It's also primarily based on a passenger and an international man made up of a very secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind him.
One or two of the newest scenes she's caught are good.
I liked it when Johnny English comes to the helicopter dressed in a middle-aged vitex trap and when the knife rotor gets short-fledged about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for the physical comedy is obvious, but humor is considered weak and very strange in a way superior, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission are self-evidently adding comic elements.
I think it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me Johnny English's abandoned adventures are not inventive and designed as Atkinson's gegos in the style of no films like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current theme that Great Britain is in serious problems.
Hacker was infiltrated into the British Super Typhoon Network by discovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last cap in a full cup of water for a prime minister, a brave and influential guy who already lives a full life of sin because of the fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this figure in a sample on Theresa May, but the scenario is quite offensive.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now serves as a teacher in some abandoned institution, but is not officially holding lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegos when English holds a spying academy in the "School Hand".
English quickly return to Whitehall on emergency instructions and how they would regroup it with an ex-immortal impatient partner Boughem, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a man, married to a submarine commander whose energy and physical role Vicki Pepperdine is a little consumed.
So Batman and Robin are again serving the secret service of Her Majesty and a happy dead woman, Ophelia Bullett, who follows Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in the castle of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the criminal Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting to wear off their comical events: destroyed in the canobars, burned elegant French restaurants, the real chaos with a cross on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English runs the right anarchy by trying to get to know the interior of Voltina's house using audiences for virtual reality.
It's obvious that the great effort has been put into this last sequence, but it's as nice and happy as it's a whole movie as it's designed for children.
A pretty medium quality.
Like other films about Johnny English, I can't ask myself: Can the British film industry think of any role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The labist party refuses to make a plan for Britain to work four days a week and to be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbina's lab party will consider a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party claims that the company's bosses will transfer to workers the time they save thanks to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
This would be how employees would enjoy the three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same payment.
Sources say this idea would "intervene" into a party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said for Sunday Times: "It is expected that a new policy will be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen during the night, but a four-day work week is an ambitious ambition that fits into the party's approach to economic recovery for the benefit of the worker, as well as in the party's industrial strategy."
The lab party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
Portparol Laburistic Party said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The opposition officer John McDonnell used the conference of the Laborist Party last week to present his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "free directors" and "professors" in municipal businesses.
The opposition officials' plans also mean that the current owners of the water supply companies may not return their total investment because the labs could target "reveal" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the company's committees and create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the company's value to employees in the private sector for which it is likely to select an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh gave a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least seven days and raised the question whether the investigation office could mention some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the "60-minute" news reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would suggest that they change their mind.
Kennedy found himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before hearing I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges appeared, I asked, "Did you do that?
He was inconceivable, determined, unintelligent."
However, Senator Graham's voice appears to have been blocked.
"My opinion of Britt Kavanaugh was formulated and a serious charge would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has energy denied it," Graham added, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she calls it can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What's the Festival of the Citizens of the World, and did he do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the home of the World Festival of Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars that will be set up, as well as an impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World's Festival of Citizens will gather tens of thousands of people at the large central park that will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also take into account the true purpose of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World's Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of a global project against poverty, an international group that seeks to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight against it.
To get an event free card (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world's leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful has the world's citizen project been since the last 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people for free concert the right way to kill themselves to take something, or just one more view of so-called "clivism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the citizens of the world's initiative has claimed that they have marked more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have been committed to a series of different objectives.
They say these actions have led world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives from more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had introduced 390 promises and published previous shares and at least 10 billion dollars had already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the resources already collected have directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are Power Shrane, the partnership of investors and investors from the United Kingdom who promised "to help children grow in their full potential", promising that Rwanda will allocate $35 million to the end of their stay in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, as you are, we can make social injustice a historical fusion," said Ambassador Mocii Ishrane, Tracey Ullman, who visited live concerts in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the barrenness of mothers and children, the government announced that it will fund the project Power of Shiran, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world will answer: "It is a long and hard journey.
However, like all major civil rights movements and anti-partheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will be present at this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "how much it will take" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of Internal Affairs, and took Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's commitment to Syria – namely, there, at the request of the legitimate government – represents an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that this is why those who want to sell energy in the Middle East are in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe and in the middle of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official's statement, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States has this opportunity to ensure, together with our Navy, that marine corridors remain open or, where necessary, block them in order to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at an event where the organizer was the Union's energy consumer, a non-profit group called itself "the voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
He made a comparison with Washington's approach on relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be about the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more part of the use and replacement of fuels," he said that Russia owns only one adduct, and that its presence depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after the mission of the Trump Administration to increase exports of mixed natural gas into Europe, which would replace Russia, which represents a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to kill Germany to withdraw from the "uncompliant" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "capital" Moscow.
Moscow has in several ways stressed that the North River 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and should double its existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, except the main project.
The Kremlin argues that the causes of the intense opposition of Washington to this project are purely economic nature and that this represents an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the American Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state has challenged Germany's response which has reaffirmed its project assignment.
The leading organisation for industry in Germany, the German Industry Union (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when some third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really think" about the presidential candidate for 2020, the state Senator of Massachusetts said
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "really think" about running for the president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city council in the city of Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would think about the candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transferred the source of The Hill.
"After 6 November I will seriously think about running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called up for criticism of the troops led by him and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of the polls published on Thursday showed that most of the electoral bodies that voted for Warren did not think it should be candidateed in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidateed, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38% of voters supporting potential candidates and 48% against candidates.
The other sound names from the order of democracy that were discussed in terms of their potential candidates in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Buden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about PTSP Track Palina in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after an incident that occurred on Monday night
"What my son goes through, through what goes on after his return, I can relate to what happens to other families that suffer the consequences of PTSP and the injuries our soldiers return with," said the public in support of President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans added, "they return a little different, they return firmly, they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other military members have given it to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assault on a female person, arresting family violence and possession of weapons under the influence of opium, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police administration of Vasilla.
18 countries, D.C. support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighty states and the Columbia District support a new US policy which cuts down asylum on victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and districts filed a friendly court report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
A lot of names of prosecutors in Grace's case against Sessions, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal police, have not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and her violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was kept in custody in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace explained how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has rejected the 2014 Immigration Appeals Committee decision which has enabled immigrants who do not have documents and runs away from violence in the family to submit asylum applications.
State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum requests be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances and that the chamber thus violates this principle," says a friendly report.
Lawyers continue to claim that the police that impedes access to immigrants are harming the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary labour force."
In June, State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant-related matters not to assign asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the family and gang violence.
"Asiel is only available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," said Sessions in a June 11th statement on politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all problems, even serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Disaster relief efforts in the city of Palu while the number of dead is doubled in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is all worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Lisa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the center of the evacuation in the abandoned city of Palu.
"Every minute emergency aid will import the body.
The government condemns clean water."
The inhabitants return to their broken homes, beat themselves by the flood of things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals broken down by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
Some of those injured, such as Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulders are broken, are located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being helped outside because of continued severe follow-up attacks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt the strong landscaper who built a hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I'm under pressure from the Russian wall," Haris said to the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town because of marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of "violent propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspapers published an announcement on four pages in U.S. newspapers thanking the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using an American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump returned Wednesday to a paid addendum of China's newspaper Daily in Des Moines Register, the most marketed newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections that will be held on November 6, which China negrates.
The trumpet's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the US elections indicates how American officials told the Reuters agency, a new phase in a skiing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
And while it is customary for foreign governments to publish declarations with a view to promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently being held in the Escalating Trade War, where some of them are increasing import tariffs.
On the contrary, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war have been targeted at exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republic Party, said in Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment published in the weekly edition of the Des Moines Register, "now it doubles its violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of prints, plasing a paid statement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find a limited number of different opinions on the streets of Beijing, and you will not be able to see any real reflection of the different views that people in China may have about the problem of China's narrow road, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the strong flag of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention what the newspapers were talking about.
Republicans reject women from voting for mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh Debt, warning analysts
Analysts warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand with the candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh, who are facing several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions related to this question are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to vote.
In these things there is no back," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said in a newspaper article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspects that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) has recently asked the FBI's investigation will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - it will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and a state speaker of the progressive movementOn group, stood in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "new bar" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee decided to investigate Kavanaugh's candidate despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasts and motivations will be enormous," said journalist Stu Rothenberg, a fearless political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is right.
But it could be higher, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't vote, although they don't like the president."
Even before the Ford's public testimony in which he issued details of allegations of alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court trial, analysts were of the opinion that it could lead to negative reactions if the Republicans were investigating the nomination.
"This has become a big deal for an old party," Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, said earlier this week.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans resolved this issue and how they dealt with it," said the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the US Group of Priorities, which supports the democratic election.
However, it seems that the Americans are so divided in terms of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, by which they are easily on the side of Kavanaugh.
The New YouGov survey shows that 41% of researchers believe in Ford's testimony definitively or probably while 35% said they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said he thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought for Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other person who has brought charges, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk condition when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her genitals while attending the parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web user plans to launch a new Internet that will override Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, runs a startup whose goal is to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on open source Solid platform, which is the creator of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or POD (personal online data store).
It can include a contact list, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access the types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data."
According to the company's principal director, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides sources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid can be available to all.
The company is currently being run by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform for IBM, a number of employees of development engineers committed to working on the project and a community of volunteers' programmers.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to ensure commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee is a very influential voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundations and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new web site," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Cross of a Dedicated Priest in World War I
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was represented by the Victorian baptism as a citizen of World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Major Bernard Vann won the recognition of September 29, 1918 for the attack on the cities of Bellengles and Lehacourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the greatest British military recognition.
At the parade held on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memory record.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that he was "unbelievably symbolic" because the monument was discovered 100 years after the promotion his grandfather received.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Sant-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under a heavy gun with warheads and militarized rifles."
Later, he rushed to the fireline and with "the greatest crowd" brought water forward before he pushed himself to the field top without any help and pulled three out of the military.
Colonel Vanna died on 4 October 1918, a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's footsteps were "something I know I could never get, but something that causes submission."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set up a farmer after the parade led by the Duchess Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of the true hero shows support that many will give."
MMA fans who've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Pep Prase
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206's sword series so you can't finally see the main event.
The San Josea program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and showed up alive during the night on Channel 5 channel in Great Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right at the moment Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, observers in Great Britain were trapped when the transfer was interrupted by Pepa Prase.
Many were little impressed that the rest of the night were awake to early morning hours just because of the fight.
A Twitter fan described this interruption of transmission to cartoon movies as "some kind of sick joke."
"It's about the government's regulation where this content is inappropriate at 6:00 in the morning, and it has to be replaced by a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, High Vice President Bellator for marketing and communication, on the subject of transfer.
"Depa Prase," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said he would advise on his plan to include observers from Great Britain in the future.
"I think that when I'm talking about recycling, I think we can probably solve that," said Cooker.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to realize anything until it comes to us on Sundays, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it's over, they've crossed the line and they've all been enemies.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government responsibility.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more of our fans, but we've gone too far.
That's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him reason to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking on the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs that represented Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "a hope."
He also said that what he became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular director of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of illness.
Acting as a loser at Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, you feel less worth and feel that I am different from the real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he was considered happy that he had the opportunity to speak without consequences and because he wanted to give others "a hope."
Trotsky World Championship said his in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 "was surprised."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years old, and said that the difference in years has never been a problem.
"When you're so young," he first appeared on the Olympic when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later from cancer -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar successes and failures.
The couple took part in the role of the boy's parents Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "full perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 in the 1940s after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would die and that he was one of the last things he asked if they still had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first order.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to sit in the first order, Dad," he said.
"I held him in my hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't victorious," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming before the local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - Proud from Heather Small - which he responded to while preparing for the Olympics and from which he is still being passed by the Germans.
Desert Island Discs is on the 4 BBC Radio program on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. by British summer time.
Mickelson of the Ryder club on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will put a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game on Ryder's buy, but he'll have to go back to shape so this wouldn't be an accident.
Mickelson, who played at the 12th record bienal, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the club on Saturday with four ball games and four games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the case for the US, the five-year-old main winner spent a day in driving and improving his game, hoping to correct what he's worried about.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the required Le Golf Nationala field, where long uneven territory regularly punishes the attack.
And if I'm not afraid enough, Mickelson is in the ninth game on Sunday facing the British Open champion, Francescom Molinary, who won all four of their games this week with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, which start 12 single games with four points less, arrive at the hot start, the Mickelson game could be absolutely judged.
Furyk said he had faith in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, grabbed me by the shoulder and grabbed me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes in himself very much.
He's a member of the House of Familiars and has brought so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't mean to play two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it went, and we thought he had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falla on Sunday for the number of Ryder matches played.
This could mark the end of his career on Ryder's path where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 beats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence had brought a certain non-material value to the team.
"He's fun, he's funny, he likes to laugh with people and it's great to have such a guy in the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for young players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a hell of a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost
Mr. Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, from experience, knows that a significant advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The days appeared for the first time at the game played in Valderram in 1997, when the party whose side was Captain Sive Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended the competition with a secret difference of 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You will always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrami, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," Bjorn said, thinking after looking at the team 2018 which won the score 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 on Le Golf National yesterday.
So my history and everybody in this team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have the goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and keep this focus on it.
I've been talking all the time, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's going on over-the-counter on the other side - the biggest player in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players on a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
It's a new day tomorrow.
There's a single game tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing your final chance as a golf player.
It's a message you have to pass to players - give your best tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he must be better than himself."
Unlike Bjorna, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk was also at the end of these great events of the last few days, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"To-morrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve great results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it comes with such a plane, it creates a great pressure on the middle of the game.
We formed our position according to it and we prepared the boys so that we try to perform some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIllroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover up everything to the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
A new German warship is waiting again
The new flag of German sailors should be released in the spring of 2014, in order to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but it will not be until at least one year due to fraud on systems and external costs, local media reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a class-led ship of completely new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by the military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after the shipment threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, which were ordered in 2007, will replace the old Fregat class Bremen.
As noted, there will be a strong top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important persons include longer periods of maintenance - it should be possible for the latest frigate to schedule up to two years without returning to the maternity ward.
However, the constant delay means that the most modern warships, which should have allowed Germany to arrange forces outside its territory, will already be mature when they start using them, notes Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper when German Navy officially refused to let the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have indicated a certain number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" for which the ship would be useless if it were to be deployed in some combat mission.
The software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuertemberg ships will manage crews from some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who managed the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is a significant burden that reduces its effect and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to unfair hardware, the price of the complete project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the original 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest fleets are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy "has gone away from ships that can be distributed."
The officer said that this problem was growing in time because the old ships were canceled and not acquired replacement ships.
He was sorry that none of the band members of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of smiles
A new study carried out on one property in the mountains of Scotland is aimed at discovering how the ants use their territory in search of food.
It is expected that the results will shed new light on the conduct of single flight elders and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scholars from the National Fund of Scotland followed by the regular smiles and type of soprano Pipistrelle, as well as the dry long smile and smile of the Daubington species in the Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
A special recording device will be set to key locations around the property to monitor mouse activity throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also perform mobile research using manual detectors.
The technical analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls to smiles and what they do.
The map will then be produced and the report will be produced to create detailed images of their behaviour at the local level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important of silences and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This data will help to determine the benefits of working on the management of stations, such as the creation of habitats, which is the best way to maintain forest for droughts and other family species.
The population of silence in Scotland and the UK has significantly decreased during the past year.
They are threatened by work on construction and development, which has a negative impact on the rest and waste of the apartment.
Winding and lighting can also pose a risk, including fine paper and chemical processing of construction materials, as well as home cat attacks.
The smiles are not really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching rain.
They use sophisticated eho-location technique to locate the bug and stop on their flight for the flight.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, has a very serious understanding of noise.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, police inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve for Shishaks in Scotland on the property of Thireve in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species of Chistos in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says ownership is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a lot of hearing areas here in Thrave," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old buildings and all good buildings.
But there's so much more I don't know about smiles, so what we're doing here and in other property will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses how important it is to check whether the ants are on possession, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's bed will kill up to 400 women and young people, which will probably lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
The smiles are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, maltreatment, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the treasure-keeping fund staff of the Scotland branch is a public to include and help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our senses, and we simply don't know how the population of most of our species develops."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers prepare a complaint against the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo is accused of rape that has been described as "false news," saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to charge German magazine Der Spiegel, who has published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing an American named Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
She was reportedly paid $375.000 to cover this incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million followers on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after reporting on the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports calling them "false news."
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's false news," said in the camera five-wheel winner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are prepared to prosecute Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "an unacceptable report on questions in the field of privacy," according to the Reuters agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "non-material damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of damage, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting in the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the playroom where he reportedly raped her anal, according to the documents provided by the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo slipped on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who ignored those "1%."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that later she agreed to an outside deal because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried she would "be publicly humiliated."
34-year-olds say they're asking for the cancellation of the contract now because it's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to go to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian cave for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will always regret losing the car manufacturer
The UK will "always regret" if it loses the status of the world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said to BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in case Bexit remains unagreed could cause loss of jobs.
A factory in Burnaston, manufactured by Toyotin Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March we will see a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear about how cross-border trade would work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain in Brexit's case without agreement.
The Toyote production line works on the "time-only" principle, where parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and EU for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it may result in a cut-off to the limit which industry believes can lead to delays and loss of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock for more than one day in her factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so that the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the "Checkers" plan offered by Theresa May for future EU relations "was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to take this opportunity," said Radio 4 at BBC in today's programme.
"The example is not only Toyote but also other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been extremely successful under the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but she warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnaston and the union of the United Union in the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when such a place of employment is imprisoned, they never return.
The President-in-Office of the Government said: "We have to clear out the precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trompo's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "candidate for another week" because there is still a struggle for candidates for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh's trial, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between the Kurmps and Russia, and the potential interference with justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Prosecutor General or not, and thus threaten Mr. Mueller's independence, has been the subject of speech in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about the sound of having talks with Trump and about the possibility of a change of president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these voices.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of the vote on his leaving.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Theump said he would "not like" to forgive Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission at which Kavanaugh was testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, the trumpet ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation against Kavanaugh for a week, which continued to delay the Senate's vote in plenary.
The stamp secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News channel on Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet set, it could be this week, and it could happen for another week having all the other things in mind about the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders didn't hold a short press conference for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a small number of short-term behaviours are not due to the "theatric behaviour" of a journalist TV, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they're going to overincrease."
Then she said the direct contact between Trupa and the journalist would be strengthened.
"The President is holding more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
The short approach will continue to be maintained, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as you've seen us do over the past few weeks, and you're going to talk to the president of the United States to replace the press with a short deal."
The Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open meetings or press conferences when visiting an official.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the media, he was unbelievably and occasionally weird.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland on Brexit-related Fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the state and wish to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Parliament of Scotland, Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the EU withdrawal of the UK.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to settle the costs of the EU citizens' status as they work in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued over the years, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also speeded up its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this was a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and throughout the world, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and advance the work of health services, benefiting from which patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
The defense team State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday defeat 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Chief coach Tennesse Statee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened a little before half-time.
"He came to a line of ground and just got down there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on the clothes and carried it to further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State said Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville, Tennessee channel that Abercrombie completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details on the type/both of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in the red print, plays the first season for Tennessee State after a transition from Illinois.
He had five total savings on Saturday before leaving the game, which he achieved 18 savings in the season.
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher rate for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will pay more tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK, using additional funds to help homeless people in accordance with new conservation plans
This move will neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
More tax will be paid to those who don't pay taxes in the UK
The treasure expected to collect up to 120 million pounds a year - for help to homeless people
Foreign buyers will be paid more tax in the purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, theres May will be published today.
This step will be considered by attempting to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in trying to attract young voters to promises that will ensure more accessible state care and focus on those who benefit more.
More tax will be paid to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's intention to fight open-ended sleep.
The additional fee, which is next to the existing tax, including more levels, introduced two years ago on the second real estate and purchase for rent, could amount to 3%.
The treasurer expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built estates in London buy people who do not have a residence in the UK, so prices increase, and purchasers who buy real estate for the first time become harder to become owners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of spirits” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the cab to help a greater number of young people get home.
He accused construction companies of holding high prices of real estate by buying the first chance of a land that they do not use, and asked Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing in order to break the British's "failure of state policy."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed municipal reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of any due process.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term of office of prime minister to returning to Britain - that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and inhuman sleep is still real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be a Scottish representative manager at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the north, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the water.
This summer he moved to the stadium after last season returned St. Mirren to the Scottish League Prime Minister.
"I wanted to become my country as a player.
I was in the B team and that was it," Ross said for the Sports Sound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I were successful in leading the club."
The Russian presidents as manager of Sanderland include Dicka Advocata, David Moyes, Sama Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roya Keanea, Gusa Poyta and Paulo Di Canioa.
The former director of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel upset because he came after such great names in such a big club, after he rejected the offers of the Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I be able to return this club to the League Premier?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly falls into the League Prime Minister," he said.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I think I'll be able to see myself as successful only if I can get back to the club where it's his place."
Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he spent as assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months as part of Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Alla recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the ivy of falling into the bottom of the league to the winner of the next season's champion.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably the real anniversary," Alla's club was reminded.
"I sincerely believed that management is a real thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds weird 'cause I wasn't bad, I earned enough and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
It's so much you have to spend every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just answers me.
I've always wanted to deal with management, and now I'm doing it, and in my whole adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I do now."
You can listen to the entire interview at the Sportssound show on Sunday, 30 September at Radio Scots from 12.00 to 13.00 p.m. by the British summer time
The perfect time for the glass is Saturday at 17:30, discovering the investigation
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British popes fighting for survival, but it increased pressure on the range of restaurants.
In the pub and baroque group, growth from 2.7% in July was achieved, but the traffic in restaurants decreased by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who collected data, said: “Sustainable suntime and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Summit led to the follow - up of a similar pattern as in the previous month of June when popes achieved an increase of 2.8%, and restaurants had even more decline.
The drop in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
The popes and the baroques focused on drinking have achieved far better results with greater growth in relation to the corresponding results from the previous period than was the fall of traffic in restaurants.
The popes focused on food also suffered because of the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, there is an increase in the sales of alcohol by 6.6% per month, with the decline of food by 3%."
Paul Newman of the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and Entertainment of RSM said: “These results continue to bear witness since the end of April.
Time opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to domestic sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle hard, although the decline of 4.8% will be particularly painful with the current price pressures.
For a long time the summer couldn't come in the worse time for food-focused customers, and the time will show whether the temperatures we had in August will provide a little more than the necessary relief."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly-opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the rapid introduction of new brands.

Every five children have a secret task on social networks that hides from their parents
Every five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret task on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers, discovers research
Research involving more than 20,000 girls in higher primary school classes revealed an increase in the number of “false Instas” pages
This news increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the girls said they had a "main" command showing their parents.
Every five children, of whom only 11 years of age are responsible for social networks that cover adults.
A survey involving 20,000 students from higher primary schools revealed the sudden growth of "false Instas" task, which refers to the Instagram photo sharing page.
These news reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the girls said they have a clean "main" job that shows parents, but they also have private tasks.
One mother who found out on her 13-year-old daughter's secret page discovered a teenage girl who another called out the words "patience me."
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness of the UK and the Conference of Independent Schools Directors and Directors (HMC) found that 40% of children from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them acknowledged that they had private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: The disturbing fact that so many teenagers come into the experience of creating an Internet space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletes Committee
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Committee as an executive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most prized Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience at international level over the past decade
"Eilige enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really get a sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and now a regular expert in BBC, remained unstarted after experiencing a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “The first month I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show me how much I'm gonna recover.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, and I've learned to walk again and I'm doing my agile exercise today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Advertisement for a publisher who shares Internet views on the Internet
The company that manufactures the publisher shared an opinion on the Internet with advertising that is deliberately related to the goods of museums.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent publisher", Elvie published a commercial inspired music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides for milk-producing mothers.
The four real mothers dance in the middle of the snow and cows with their song: "Yes, I'm married but I don't have a rap" and "If you haven't noticed, but we don't know it, it's my chest."
"Pamp, pump, feed my baby, pump, pump, man myself."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, he saw the various reactions of the viewer, while many said he was putting light on the "dangerous" dairy industry.
"The use of the goods for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to be pregnant and born like us to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's release pump is discrepancy in breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is clear that it is both traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use it for a traitor's commercial for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Adverts have no meaning."
Others stood in the defense of advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was "fucking" to her.
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I was still pregnant.
For betraying, I felt like a cow.
It's a little blubbery, but I realized it was right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a ridiculous advertising focused on mothers who deliver milk (often at work or in a toilet) and feel like "crowds".
This isn't a commercial that praises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their chests.
The concept of advertising is based on the discovery that many mothers who practice milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely intact, there are no wires or pipes and stands in the breastpiece for babies, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they're milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive director of Mother’s company, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves smooth and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between the breast and the neck of the mouse we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump offers.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump got into news headlines.
During the week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the bridge in the creation of Marte Jacubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants increased, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trup's administration made it difficult to find a guardian for children.
Traditionally, most parents and themselves were migrants without documents who were afraid to threaten their ability to stay in the country by doing what they would do to accept the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential elders and other adult members of their households would have to print fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, told Congress last week that this service had been arrested by ten people who had reported for custody of minors without follow-up.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were not convicted in the past.
"About 80% of the persons who are or are parents or members of the household of the parent are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're going to keep looking for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers say at the reception site.
Many will respond to a video call instead of personally, in order to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported soon.
The longer children stay in prison, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to the outbreak of anger or forced eviction, the harder workers will be given access and reports coming from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as those in the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to predict signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a city without enough time to get emotionally ready or to greet friends can lead to a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria calls for an immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also invited Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has been for eight years.
Moulem, who is also on the role of prime minister's deputy, said that the parties are illegal in the Syrian country, under the excuse of the fight against terrorism and "that they will be accounted for in a proper way."
They have to sit down and get off without a word," he said on the seat.
Moulem insisted that in Syria "war against terrorism is almost over," where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "the war of the world until we crush all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "the presence of every side."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily responsible for training and counselling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country of war.
According to refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed "one Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that would cause refugees not to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be a clear humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for rebuilding Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel resort in Idlibu has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has launched a major attack on the Syrian forces that support Russia in the province where three million people live.
Moulem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear hands" and expressed hope that war action would be launched against the Jihadists and fighters from Nusra's front associated with Al Kaid, who would "be exhausted."
Ambassador UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to gather soon the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members in order to draw up a draft post-mortem constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
The Moulem issued the terms of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee's work, saying that the will of this body should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another mandate
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected at the 2020 elections unless many liberal observers are likely to hope, opposition and scandal will not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate all the time!"
For now there's no sign of surveillance freeze.
Since 2014, more than doubled by 1.05 million on CNN channel and nearly ruined by 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the attack term, unlike four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show's show channel MSNBC took over the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the night with attack news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," Neal Baer, producer of the "chosen survivors" drama on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a number of raw truth about bringing into Hollywood boys' club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for the trumpet.
She asked.
"He said, 'cause he's laughing at me,' said Mrs. Scowell.
Haos has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the Roe's abortion law against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the global situation will be.

However, you went a little further from general information when you realized that you had been looking at the expert panel for six hours as he discussed how Bob Woodward used the "deep background" sources for his book "Strah," about what Paul Manaforta from his feet worth $15,000" (“Brightenware", wrote Washington Post) and the implications of the described descriptions, this, anatomical, Mr. Trumpa, which provides Stormy Daniels.
Yeah, for example, I'm never gonna look at Super Mary with the same eyes anymore.
"A part of what he thinks you experience as a reality show is that you have something to eat every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and creation of the "Zalagaonica", commenting on the rotation of the playhouse and the daily problems of the Trump show (critique of the American football league, thanking Kim Jong-un).

When I got to Mr. Fleissa this week, before his house on the north coast of the island of Kauaija was sunned at about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed inside and looked at MSNBC and at the same time filmed CNN.
He could not separate himself from the screen until Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Legal Commission and while his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.

Large cash flow from the side in the most unexplored mid-term election for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th round is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the resurgence of the convention areas which resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent crossing of the district border in the city of Pittsburgh led to the election of democratic representative Conora Lamba, who came to the head of the other district after the foreign elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th round of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th round.
The cards were re-emerged after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circuits were inextricably formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th round launched a fight for the financing of the campaign between the main foreign financial fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the broad-based special elections for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania in March.
This position has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won an area with an advantage of more than 20 points.
Political analysts have given the unknown priority to democracies.
The United States considers El Salvador’s punishment for support from China, but then withdraws
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a bit of Washington's substantiation.
Mr. Trump had a heartbreaking meeting with President Panam Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had hotels in Panama until partners expelled the Trump's management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions they no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, in a statement early in the month.
But penalties are considered only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted visa limitation, would be difficult to tackle this Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which should be continued by a similar past year's collective effort to prevent the arrival of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually suspended any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now banned for mid-October, which represents a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new serious messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House speaker, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the discussions described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their findings were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible execution of the Court of Justice by Trump, with significant evidence now available in public records.
Mr. Mueller also referred to his investigation, according to the reports, to discover the possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attacks on the elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just when he is ready to step back before the voter and perhaps before the jury.
There are a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, even those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to carry out a state attack on Hitler, just because the West opposed and supported Chechslovak in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of generations that followed.
The course of history revolves around such noble points, and the infamous march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more than one of those extremes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fired the deputy of the main prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an undisclosed position since this letter last year reported that he has submitted a secret recording of the president and has expressed his suspicion that he is not similar to the performance of the functions.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brit Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if its application for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep long winter dreams.
But I believe we're not going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auszvic to the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I was the ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that crimson table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Becha
The Rangers are home to Rapid from Becha on Thursday, knowing that it will defeat the Austrians after an impressive remier in Spain against Villallrela at the beginning of this month, to be in a good position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage of the knee prevented the tied player Graham Dorrance to debate all these seasons until the unsolved arrow with Villarela's final result 2-2, but it is confident that Rangers can use that result as a dropboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal was a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with the point.
Maybe we could finally take them, but in all, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we're back in the second and we're better.
On Thursday he's expecting us again for a great European night.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a hard sword because they've had a good outcome in the previous game, though, with public support we can certainly win and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was no doubt difficult, starting from what happened to my injuries, and then to change into the club itself, but now we are content with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and guys are really enjoying it; we're training it well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of concern for pension savings
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear idea of how to care for them, few of them spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the investigation of the nationwide company said they had talked to their spouses about its long-term costs.
Just 10% of them said she was talking about it with her children.
"People want someone in the family to talk about them, but they don't want to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector in the Nationwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give it to you unless you first express your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to be given to him because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can help you and figure out how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that would help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Collect your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Make an authorisation to make a decision on medical assistance so that you can have an authorised person of trust who will monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider and conclude a multi-stakeholder financing agreement.
This means that you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions in your name and take care of your accounts if you are unable to pay them.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is in a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with more attacks from an Air Gun in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with several shots from the airgun while the dogs returned home from the night shift.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30, according to the British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police called the witnesses to answer.
Land mines and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of violent earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials announced, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result of the interruption of the link, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the territory of Doghree, a region north of Palu, which is close to the 7.5-phase epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Doghrei, on the island of Sulawesia:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was hit by thunder and lightning.
Doghera is a zone that covers more than 300 km (180 miles) west of the island of Sulawesian.
The area, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The fisheries and agriculture are based on the region of Central Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Doghrea.
Nikula miners are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowalja, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palu and Doghre were hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghrey.
Kunami hit the Western Donghur in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Fire Zone and is a regular part of the earthquake.
These are some of the major floods and tsunamis in recent years:
2004.: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north coast of Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005: A series of strong attacks hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006.: The earthquake of 6.8 steps hit southern Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, triggering tsunamis that invaded the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009.: The earthquake of 7.6 steps hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatran province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010.: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, resulting in the tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: The plague hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the deadly outbreak of floods and tsunamis in 2004.
This time it didn't come to the tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destruction of the building.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where life lost more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Algeria and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he had committed domestic violence, stopped family violence and resisted arrest, says a report published on Saturday by the government police agency of Alaska.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was held in the Mat-Su prison unit and he was sentenced to $500 conditional bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in the court on Saturday where he explained on the issue of an explanation of the crime that "it's definitely no fault", this network announced.
The fire is faced with three Class A infringements, which means that he will be threatened by a prison sentence up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with breaking class B, which is sentenced to a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time that criminal reports have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, harassment of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcohol-related condition.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Saru Palin criticised the Veteran Group in 2016 after bringing his son's violent behavior to the PTSP after he served in Iraq.
Land mines and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been an interruption of connection and supply of electricity, and it is expected that the number of dead will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake epicenter was directly with the central part of Sulawesian, northeastern of the main city of Indonesia, Jakarte.
The social networks are surrounded by videotapes showing the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala when the rabbits invaded the coast.
Union prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfulla Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight persons were killed - a rare penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used the rented truck of Home Depot to carry out a bicycle race along the West Side road in Donny Manhattan, where he picked up the sands and bicycles that were on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "invented" killed eight victims and "invented" committed a serious physical injury, according to a request for the death penalty imposed in the South New York district.
After both of these points, it is possible to make a death penalty, as stated in a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saip of 22 counts involving eight charges of murder and rectification, which federal prosecutors usually use in case of organised crime, as well as allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saip's conduct it as "fashioned, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saipov caused harm, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," says the request for a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since New York's South District last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were murdered after being sentenced to prison for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 at an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show up in days and months after the attack.
He told the researchers that he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video tape on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he said to the prosecutor.
He also asked for an ISIS facility in his hospital room, the police reported.
It's clear that it's not the fault of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were apparently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment without the possibility of release of a crime, will only increase the flow of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense earlier asked the prosecutor not to make a death sentence.
The Conservative Ambassador says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the national army" today during a protest at a conservatory conference.
The former Head of the Independent Party of the UK said that politicians should "feel discontent" Eurosceptics, as one of the messengers Theres May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at the poll in Birmingham that the UK had so far "out" that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in trying to bring together their deeply divided lines was stressed by conservatives who were talking about the rest of the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from the Chechers despite attacks and attacks by supporters and oppositions from Brexit and the EU.
The Unions insisted that it continue its efforts to agree with Brussels despite negative reactions, and urged Eurosceptics and Laborers to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Goth Group meant going to Solihulu that he wanted to "reject the Chechers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be entitled and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was the head, we'd already be out," he said.
A messenger from Wellingborough added: "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we have to get the checks out."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world's wars to be born.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the statement that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to stay is completely wrong."
“ I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people, ” said Brothers Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also attended a group.
The Chechers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our country and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the plan from Chechers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: "The Prime Minister is able to keep his place of work when he keeps his promises."
Mr Farage told the audience that politicians must "feel dissatisfied" if they are willing to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that won't happen to you".
In a letter to the pleaser, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s publishing, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize this country's national army that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remains were marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour assembly in the city center.
Several activists were among the "Torriers against Brexit" after the formation of this week's group.
The labist Lord Adonis complained to conservatives about the security problems they had with the application of the party to open the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the "Canada plus" plan for an unrestricted state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit isn't possible," he added.
Warren is seriously planning to think about the candidate for the president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously think about the presidential candidate" after November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a resident from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participating meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elected to vote against a Republican representative in November at the representative's home, Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chairing the trumpet campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's in the center of speculation to deal with Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors on which a participatory form of meeting has been used since Trump took up duty.
One of those present asked if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren has denied how time women go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, which includes a woman on the head."
A arrest after the LSU's Sims was shot.
The police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday arrest of a suspect for a gun that killed LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at the press conference.
On Friday a video of the shooting was released, looking for help in finding a man who looks at the picture.
Sims, 20, was hit and killed near the South University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head following what he passed," he reported to the media chief of police Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade was involved in protecting his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was tested and admitted that he was in the scene of a crime, in possession of a weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the police station in the eastern Baton Rouge.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after his order guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it has become clear that team leader will play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his team member.
The winner first went into the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at the beginning, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into box one round later and went out behind the Vettela, but Hamilton went forward after the action point since the driver Ferrari accidentally caused him to leave the free interior with the risk of staying behind after a double move in defense of the third race.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of rescue and was seven at the end of the first circle on his 21st birthday.
He then drove most of the race on his tires to get to a quick finish and crossed the Kimmy Raikkonen on the fourth floor.
He finally got into box on the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up the rest of the eight rounds while Raikkonen took a fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend and he was the real gentleman who let me through.
The team did a really extraordinary job to make one or two final formations," said Hamilton.
That was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinsten at the motion on Saturday because she insisted that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford in a letter to whom the Supreme Court candidate Britta Kavanaugh accuses of sexual abuse.
Speaking on a motion in West Virginia, the President did not directly deal with the testimony of the Forum before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, corrupt and deceptive.
The only thing that could have happened was a wonderful thing that happened in the last few days at Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information they've been leaking in the public, and then they say O, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you posted information to the public?
Remember her answer... did you leave a document in the public--but what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leave it to the public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it investigated early in September -- yet Feinsten demanded that the information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story to the public." Feinstein said to the committee, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked."
But her denial was not found at the president's approval, which on the motion on Saturday night commented: "To tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe it isn't, but I've never seen a bad word in my life."
Continuing his defence candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president insinuated that democracy uses these instructions for its own purposes.
They are determined to return power at every price.
You see evil, madness, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who's got to pass through to get to power and control," the media transmits the words of the president.

Patrick Dwyer won two rounds for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars gathered for victory from Belfast Giantsa in Elte League on Friday, winning 5 to 3 in the backyard in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants at the beginning took advantage of the two naked beats of Patrick Dwayer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equation before Dwyer returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before two blind Lucas Lunvald Nielsensna gave them a victory.
It was the third hit in the Elte season for the boy Adam Keefa, who came from the back and won Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting in the two-sided season, and Gianntis won the previous three shots.
Dwayer opened his sword in the fourth minute, 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilier and doubled his leadership four minutes later.
In August at the beginning, Sullivan returned home team in the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquartt assisted Cownie for comparison at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer provided Giants' leadership by the second round of the evening at the end of the first period.
At home he regrouped and Bouchard brought them together again to balance the weight of the power down at 27:37 minutes.

The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the plane escape land.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was announced by a hero after he died as a safe flight from several hundred people.
More than 800 people died, and many water was lost after the mighty earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, starting with the tsunamis.
A lot of rearbreaks are still happening in this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place of work in the control tower at Muteara Sis Al Jufri Palu, who was badly wounded.
He stayed to ensure safe flight to Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then standing on the bridge.
When he realized that the control tower was breaking up, he jumped out of it.
He moved to the hospital later.
Portparol Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
Our hearts are ashamed of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state agency for mitigation of the consequences of the disaster suggests that access to the cities of Doghrea, Siggi and Boothong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as the number of bodies continues to grow under the debris, and to many it is not possible to access," Sutopo Purwo Nugro said.
The waves that reached the height and left Pala for up to six meters, where a mass drop will be held on Sunday.
War and commercial planes provide help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about Sky News: The emergency vehicle brings the body every minute.
The government loses clean water.
Small shops are stealing everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia rushed to provide assistance to survivors, but we don't know what they'll do there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo travelled to Pala on Sunday and sent the military to the state: I ask all of you to work full-time in carrying out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lomboka where more than 550 people were killed.
The fall of a plane in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after the fall of a plane into a light face, one face is running like a disappeared.
The airline whose aircraft landed in a peaceful settlement in Micronesia reports that one face is running away as if it had disappeared, after all 47 passengers and crew members have been safely evacuated from the plane it landed.
Air Niugini's announcement suggests that from Saturday afternoon they're not able to track the passenger.
The airline reports how they work in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a search for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land on the island of Chuuk.
The officers announced on Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were kept in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what exactly followed the event.
And the airlines and the American sailors announced that the plane ended up in the bay and didn't reach the bridge.
Some fathers think the plane flew through the gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said how he and the others managed to get out of danger through the water that got them into the plane he hit.
He said the crew was in the panic and cried, and he suffered head injuries.
A U.S. Navy said that mariners working near the port repair site also helped save the boat from a collision that passengers had transferred to the coast before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
The Air Safety Network data show that 111 people died in the accident of the airline registered in PNG in the last two decades, but that not one of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed what happened on the night the woman was burned alive.
The case was closed on Saturday in the repeated proceedings against the person charged with burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
Before his trial, he said he used data from his mobile phone to take a picture of the move of accused Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jesse Chambers, aged 19, on the night that her death took place.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones that show Tellis was with Chambers on her death night, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his own claims friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
On the prosecutor's question, did Tellis tell the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another setback was that Tellis confirmed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data showed that they knew each other for just one week.
Rowlett is that Tellis was a certain time after Chambers' death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start on Sunday with the presentation of the final words.
The judge said he expected the trial before the jury to follow him later in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude of this genre by fulfilling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has been away from its beginnings when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and return popularity to the enlightened hip hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are again gaining popularity in Great Britain through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
The New York nanny is accusing a few of the withdrawals after a racist message.
The New York Nanny complains a couple for withdrawal on a discriminatory basis after she mistook a message from the mother in which she complains she is another black person."
A few refuse to be racist, evaluating the complaint as an insult."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed discontent when after her arrival on the first working day of 2016 she realized that she was a new parent of children, Giselle Maurice, black.
There's no other CRNKINJA," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her, Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her gag, Plasco-Flaxman abandoned Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former girlfriend, who was an Afro-American, had done her job badly and that instead she was expecting a Philippines, she transferred New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a salary for one day's work and sent home with a warrant.
Maurice now sues a couple seeking an exemption, as well as a fee of 350 dollars a day in six months, to what extent it is primarily committed to living with the family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said on Friday for Post, adding that it's discrimination."
A couple in racist charges recalled that it was reasonable to dismiss Mauritian's undertaking because they were afraid that after they hurt her they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," he said for Post husband Joel Plasco.
But would you believe your children to someone you hurt, even if it was made up of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
He qualified the complaint as an insult," Plasco said that his wife had only two months of family leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
You're gonna kill someone like that?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the trial was still under way, the court was quick to judge money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be exposed to the bear speaking, discovering a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: It's hard to put someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's success."
He says that her father, who was, before a little bit of a bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, but was positive if his wish was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was fulfilled and happy and sad after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, who described as a very important member of our family."
He was these men, he didn't like to thank you," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child could achieve something and you're proud of it, although it's actually not your reward.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the benefits to Paddington alone."
My daughter died, and we had to apologize over the phone.
Her daughter was suddenly transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say it's bad, and they didn't expect him to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave her the heart would keep the pump of blood slowed down and no longer flowed through her blood.
She died a few minutes before that and everything was closed.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be confused."
At the end of Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, jumped into the plane with the other passengers, who didn't dream of what shock she went through.
No one knew," she said.
I shook my head, and my tears ran down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but over the years, I've had a feeling about Nadu.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tragic women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who were loved to commit suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrees put cards on a large bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydneyu, said her son was a prospective cook with an infected smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would look at every room."
However, before he died he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that this will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis designed those cards so that people would know that there is someone you can talk to and whom you can talk to, so it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and keep silent - talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was unsustained, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his presence.
He was on the bottom of it when the children opened their gifts, but he didn't look at them in the eyes of anything else."
She says that his death was a tragedy for them, but they had to cross it: It leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's bothering us.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, the future of Bretta Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought if we were really able to get something out of what he was asking for -- a limited duration investigation and both -- maybe it would have brought us together," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding how the committee is afraid of falling apart because of disturbing foreign positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want an FBI investigation?
Their discomfort is caused by a moment's choice.
The Congress elections are held for all five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans pass away badly, as expected, their efforts to make their man elected in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, voting for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him and his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's gonna happen after the FBI makes its report?
It will be voted in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnough could get at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of escapes from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling on data from the South Korean Federal Ministry, Park Byeong-Seug points out that 1127 ran in comparison with 2011 when the figure was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are the strong control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates that criminals pay.
Pyongyang didn't publicize himself.
A large majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered to South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a solid protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China escapes the view of illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have been well adjusted in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang for the first time in order to discuss suspended negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, at which broad consensus was reached to work on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong charged US sanctions for a recent lack of progress.
Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not take into account that we are first single-minded," RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh a hysterical," she said she was unlike to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh Historic" and said he was unliked for service in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Ostin, Texas.
I couldn't and I don't think that a woman would ever be called hysterical if she ever acted like that," Pelosi said for his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were teenagers.
During his introductory presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally screaming and complaining about his family and his high school years,
He also strongly condemned democracies in the committee, evaluating his allegations of gross and aggressive attacks on his personality" which organized liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his fear of the damage to democracy.
I think he is disqualifying himself by such statements and by the way he went against Clinton and democracy," she said.
The question is whether he will try to call Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of the House of Representatives, Pelosi is silent.
I'll say the next -- if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court where he's on now," Pelos said.
Kavanugh is currently the District District Court District of Colombia's District Court.
Pelosi added how she was concerned as a Democrat for any Kavanaughi's trial against the Act on Accessory Health Protection or in the case of Roe against Wade, as they consider him a conservative judge.
In hearing his confirmation, Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not time for a hysterical, fearful person to stand in court and expect us to say it isn't great," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
The righteous soul, the wrath that has been stored up for months and years, cannot be redeemed without payment.
We're crying when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot with a woman who was a executive director where she was, and who said how she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that she realized that when she gets angry and starts to cry, the person she'd talk to said you might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Sozes are allowed a way to throw off the anger part and because they are basically misinformed.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job, in the office where most men were there, is how I was when I once cried because of an unpredictably angry rage, an old woman - a cold boss I've always been a little scared - grabbed by the door and pulled out on the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they're gonna be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
When Hart was arrested in 1987 on the Money Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason not to consider himself a candidate for the president.
That was not a well-thoughted decision," she told me in a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow and seven patrols."
Since the campaign was already slowed down, she stayed with the fundraising, so she said she wouldn't get into the race if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her hostages who gave her $1,000 to men would give her all the $250.
Do they think I have a break?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to collect funds and target the voter instead of their representatives, and the run for the cause of jealousy - from which she got stuck in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder, "how the press responded to her.
You'd think Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put me in a memory?
She cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and until the end of the battle, the gap between the countries can be long-term from the benefits of Beijing, the hard-to-work experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, launched his first warning at the beginning of this year by providing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, wheels and aluminium.
The biggest hit took place this week with new tariffs that fell off items worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which practically reimbursed half of all slaves coming from the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest introduction of a five-to-ten percent tariff on American slave is worth $60 billion.
China has said that the US will respond to the same measure, and the world economy will not seem to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to satisfy demands, but the public prayer in the US would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its next move well, US bidders in the trade war can long-term positively support China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a sudden environmental fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return to refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country of war that has been plagued for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam stated how conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists in order to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would be well able to help restore the affected country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that had assisted in the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018. The US final score was 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times together on the European ground and have not won Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown while Danish Captain Thomas Bjorna won 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered during the entire tournament, threw the ball into the water on the 16th floor, par 3, leaving the game of French Molinary.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds, and became one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorna Olsena from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team.
The world's most aggressive player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 by 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder buy.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all the time tournaments with 25,5 points won in career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't keep myself today.
This was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the purchase again.
It's an important team here and I'm glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after a European victory.
The boss gives his country John Rama who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 by 1 in single matches on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, growing up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four shots in France and now holds a career record from 13-21-3 on Ryder's shop.
Extraordinary statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 biggest titles and remains only for Jack Nicklus.
The American team has been trying to find a way to the hole all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justina Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we gave Europe a break.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Captain Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup team, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're excited."
