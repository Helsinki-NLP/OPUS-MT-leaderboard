A travel warning to the State of Missouri is issued by civil authority groups
As a result of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the United States has a colouring association (NAACP) that is preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACCP, which came into force on 28 August 2017, called for a series of suspicious racial events in the state of Missouri, where all non-American travelers, tourists and the state of Missouri should pay particular attention and take a very cautious attitude when travelling in the state of Missouri," the group declared.
NAACP noted that a recently adopted law in Missouri made it more difficult for people to overcome discrimination and that the law of the State was also to a certain extent directed at minorities, which led the organization to issue travel warnings.
The violation of civil rights is taking place on people.
They were beaten or killed because of the color of the car, "The Kansas City Star, NaaCP President of Missouri, told The Kansas Star.
"We've received many complaints, there's no previous number. "
This is the first such warning issued by the organization to a state in the United States.
The organization called for the deaths of Toli Sanders, a 28-year-old black man, from the University of Missouri, for black students.
This year, Sands died in a case of suspicion that he spent fuel during his trip to the state of Missouri and was detained by the police in the state of Missouri without a charge of crime.
It also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor-General in Missouri showed that "the possibility of the black drivers in the country being stopped by vehicle is 75 per cent higher than the white man".
She said: "This advice is to raise people ' s awareness and warn their families and friends and colleagues about what might happen in the state of Missouri. "
"People need to be prepared whether they take the insurance money to Missouri or let their relatives know that they're traveling within the state."
According to the latest data on the hate crime report plan of the Federal Investigation Board, in 2015, the State of Missouri reported 100 hate crimes; according to the crime level, the country was listed at point 16.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination.
In the past, the United States adopted immigration law enforcement laws, which called for the detention of migrants in the local law enforcement sector, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this initiative would increase the number of racial proceedings and issued travel advice to Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Government of the United States against other countries, but have recently been adopted by the Advisory Group in order to respond to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city in the world.
Referring to the news network on 18 January, British media reported that Beijing may have three thousand years of long history, but it is also rapidly becoming a modern-day city.
The capital of China has a high-speed Internet that has a surprising face-to-face recognition of software, which has invested enormous resources in human wisdom and has an unwarranted internationalization power, which is one of the most exciting cities for foreign people who are in search of a spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company website on 16 January, German civil servant Clemens Sehi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere after this. " He refers to the words of the song by the singer Frank Sinatra of New York City.
"If Sinatatra lives today, he will probably sing a song like this in Beijing. "He says that living in this city will make you feel" living in a new age," he says.
The elderly live in England, but recently in Beijing, Simon Newton published an article on the 4Corners7Seas website: "There is a feeling of something great in general, which is hard to tell, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will be like and want to see evidence."
It is reported that the high-quality Internet of this city and the environment of technology friendly make daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Peniafurt, who currently serves as a deputy member of the Beijing Children ' s website, said: " Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, and the Internet integrates traditional money packages into smart phones to make it easier for everyone to make many transactions. "
It is reported that, however, intelligence phones are only the beginning of Beijing's technology greed, and the Department's identification software has been widely recognized, and many mobile applications use these technologies to account for and pay for access to apartments and offices and even use them to verify the identity of the motor vehicle drivers.
Beijing has recently announced an estimated $138.0 billion of people's currency building an industrial science plant, where there will be 400 enterprises to build and they will focus on the development of all kinds of industrial engineering technologies that can be identified from biodegradable vehicles to automatic vehicles.
Food is also at the heart of many important days in China's history, participating in these celebrations being celebrated by foreigners, which is one of the most important social and economic holidays and is one of the most easily attended by foreigners.
She said: "I suggest that I help Chinese friends prepare for the past year to rent an apartment and write a new year's holiday alliance on the door. All family members are going to have a great meal on the same day, and then spend the rest of the year until midnight, and then take a new year with bright fire. For strangers, it is a real opportunity to join friends and family tonight. "
It is reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing and growing, but the language barriers of China and the facilitater exchange between the villagers are easily due to their lack of full integration into local culture.
She says: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but their host country has almost nothing to experience.
"In these so-called "old outer spheres" ("old outer sphere" means that foreigners are mixed only among foreigners, but not in touch with local and local cultures — translators' notes), foreigners are being accommodated in their communities, they are eating in Western restaurants, and there are only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit of general -- it's easier than people might think.
Sehi said: "The two-hour private Chinese lessons or lessons should be adapted to everyone ' s busy schedule every week. "
The short words of a number of textbooks can also be helpful in preparing meals at the restaurant or in driving out a car.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years some problems have been addressed by Governments.
The population emphasized the importance of outdoor activities during the less often hot months of pollution and the opportunity for the days to be celebrated in a long-standing cave or on an open-aired day-to-day fair.
Noton said: " Beijing is the largest city in China that can be found on the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, exciting nightlife, history, more modern business areas and ancient cave communities. "
The report considers that ageing is becoming increasingly evident in terms of obstacles to human capital growth, particularly in the North-East region, and that ageing is one.28 per cent of the annual contribution to human capital growth.
It was welcomed that the current risk of cross-border capital flows was controlled and that the key factors of international balance of payments remained long-term.
On 17 December, the New Beijing Network (the news media) opened the China People's University of China on 17 December 2016 for rehabilitation and protection of the International Highway Forum for the Rehabilitation and Protection of the World because of its heritage.
The EU Commission in April this year accuses Hong Kong’s mobile phone manufacturer of pre-cancer and Chrome’s search for software that would not allow it to use other Hong Kong applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be harmful to consumers' interests and impedes competition.
The EU controller first asked Kong to respond by 27 July.
If the crimes against them are established, Hong Kong will face the highest penalty of 10 per cent of its global camp and approximately US$74 million.
Kong has not yet commented on this.
Hong Kong also faces EU investigations in order to focus on its own procurement services in search results.
The remains of the bluefin tuna are actually true, which can say that he did not achieve the "floating" level from the country to the country, and his growth is still surprising.
A picture of the legal status of Bitmond around the world.
Summary: In addition to the price recovery caused by the natural nature of the polling engine, the number of currency fluctuations in this cycle are not related to the "dwelling" — the control risk.
From a visible map, East countries are more protected than Western countries, while countries with a global theme are still looking at the legality of digital currency, representing "the risk of the black sun".
:: This text comes from Wall Street (ID: wallstreetcn), Edited King Mu. More excellent information is requested by Wallstreetcn.com, or download Wall Street Information APP.*
With China, Korea and the EU's major market control storm, such as BIT, has been pumped into blood since this week's global currency, two weeks of BIT's price dropped by $10,000, and a maximum day of three years has gone by.
In addition to the price resurgence generated by the natural nature of the polling machine, the number of currency fluctuations are also linked to the "dwelling" — a long-term risk control.
In this important context, the Web site HowMuch.net has developed a map showing the legal status and degree of control of the states of the world.
As shown in the picture below, the green representative of the legal market in Bitmond; the green representative of the middle market, although not yet publicized by the legislative status of Bitt; the limited market, i.e. the local government tries to use the currency by means of red line policy or control; the deep blue representative of Bittmann is defined as an illegal country; and the green is a country that has not yet been evaluated.
(Figure from HowMuch.Net visualization team on 15 January)
The article noted that it was possible to distinguish between the red color of the image and that the traditional Oriental countries were more concerned with the viewpoint of the West side than those of the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defined as an illegal one, China is one of the largest limited markets in Bitmond and India is one of the largest countries that have not yet been evaluated for Bitmond and has not yet issued relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the highest-level areas of acceptance, i.e. the distribution of green balls.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America have been clearly differentiated from that of the Batman, and the color distribution of the above-mentioned regions is more complex.
Among them are Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil, which are legitimate Bitmoon markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, and which have some restrictions on their trade and use.
In the globalized data, 99 countries (or more than 40 per cent) in 246 countries with statistics are aware of the fact that there are no restrictions on trade and use of bitumen, i.e. green and blue areas.
Seven countries (or more than 3 per cent) are limited markets (red) and 10 countries (or more than 4 per cent) are defined as illegal (deep green), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) are still not receiving more digital currency information (green).
This indicates that countries with a global theme (53% and more than half) are still observing the legality of foreign currency capital in Bitmond, and represents a high level of "black-and-black risk" in Bitmond, some of which may eventually make a legislative decision limiting the currency.
The article considers that the global regulatory body is still not fully aware of this new category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet done so.
Although the " human air " in Bithamn has grown at the index level since last year and has not been of interest to all countries, some countries may be concerned about the threat of local currency, or more about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street News has been detailing information on the international control of Bitmund since last week, including the Chinese launch of the online platform and the mobile app at the foreign trade site, while the Korea is still considering closing digital currency transactions, which the EU considers that Bitmund has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors ' risk of "compensating bloodless".
The Wall Street Information Editor's selection "Read more about 2018: Globally open currency year?" has been mentioned, from control, acceptance/critication, and a position adopted, that will become the global currency year 2018.
Russia's large countries, such as Russia, criticized the legal status of the currency, which was also intended to allow officials to issue digital currency routes.
On 8 January, the New York Society (reporter of intelligence) took a picture of the New York City's new Kutinoo 8 in Nokamp.
Kutinoo adopted a physical examination of Basa on the morning of that day and signed a contract with Patomeu, President of Basa in 2023.
Then he took a picture of almost 7,000 football players in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Cutino was €16 million (about €7.77 million), the first price of the Basa Club and the Western History.
Because Cutino was still in pain, he had to rest for nearly 20 days until he was able to get his own shoes off his back.
What else is holy?
The White House of Tranquo is now on its way to free women.
The most sure sign of the regime was when they started attacking the image.
So, in 2003, Saddam? Hussein was carefully planned.
Stephen Miller, one of the key wisdoms of the Tranup government, was to discuss with the U.S. TV news network Jim Acosta (Jim Acosta) what would happen when the president's proposal for strict restrictions on legal migrants was made.
Honestly, Miller didn't attack the image himself.
If he did so, a group of shipowners and liberarians would have taken him for life.
But he actually attacked the meaning of images, especially in 1903, when the famous song of Lazarus was built on the base (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller replied to Acosta: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but free women are a symbol of the United States' freedom to see the world....
It's not part of the original free woman's image. "
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern response to the Lazarus ’ death, and the only country seems to invite not only any older migrants but also the poorest among the poor: "Your poverty, your poverty, or the desire of the people of your group to breathe freely and/or those who suffer from the sea you own. "
There's no "rejection of the sufferer" on our screen.
Miller had not done his work in writing, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed by the United States in the Tranian era.
This conflict on the meaning of images is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus (Lazarus) and her activities, after her death, to bring her speech to the attention of her friends on the ground, clearly indicate that their participation was highly political.
The purpose of this poem is to express the link between France and the United States of America through the passage of an old text as a woman of the free God.
Lazara changed its meaning: women are no longer depicted in her hats, and she wants to vote.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of the flood.
It is a successful political change in women's rights, and it is a devastating fight against American patriotism.
As the Rasa Road changes the image, the right-hand man has always wanted to change it.
Rush Limbaugh, a prominent speaker, was a temporary bather who in 2010 felt that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but he was now a new early conservative and brought the U.S. fireflies to the foolish world: "The free woman was a brave woman."
She was going to take the fire of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
Fire doesn't shine the way of the United States."
It's not unusual that Linbo was actually driven by something.
The meaning of images depends entirely on the perspective of knowledge.
The most powerful practice in Lazarus's life is to see it. When tired, poor, desperate people are able to see it on board the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
From the standpoint, this is related to those seeking asylum and has the opportunity to improve the outlook of people living in the world.
Her pictures convey to them and they need the hope they hear and the intentions they have heard.
Of course, it's not the view that Miller and Tranpus wanted to admit.
Not for the sake of light, but for the enjoyment of the only source of strength.
In 2006, Sajuy became the first Chinese person to enter into a contract with the headquarters of the United Kingdom.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black
Elidh Doyle.
Nier, Executive Director of the British Trade Association, Black, said that a team of 16 superpowers from the World Trade Group would make a significant contribution to "the country team".
The number of actors in the World Cup in London, 2017, who were selected to participate in the opening of the fifth week of 2017, was the most historical event in history.
In the view of Black, "Sugland is achieving unusual development", British peasants must learn from the middle.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will keep going until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm looking for people at the Sugland Sports School who think it's related to them.
The Sugland Landers consider this to be related to them.
The British Trade Association considers this to be related to them.
That's what people on the street think.
Whatever the case, it's very embarrassing."
Several Sugland field activists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, were chosen to be the leader of the team at 5,000 metres away from Mo Farah.
"Eried's a little tired.
It's hard to believe her speech," Black said.
"Many rural activists, whether they live or train anywhere in the country or go from door to door with pride and go out ten times.
It's a good feeling and a real feeling of Elide's natural input."
The head of the federal bank, which will take part in its fifth World Cup 400 meters of cross-cool competition, said that 16 of the British National Teams were members of the Sugrene, which was "unthinkable".
In the past, the largest number of actors in the World Cup in the Sugland field was seven, namely the number of tournaments achieved in 1983 and 2015.
She was created in the last year by five British records and two European records.
She's going to take part in a 1500-mile and 5,000-metre project competition.
She had achieved a good success in the course of the 1500-metre race, and she had won a victory in the pre-election and O'O's cycle in Britain, respectively.
Doyle recalled that she was in the first World Cup, and the only one in the team was Lee McConnell.
The commander said that she was very proud that so many of her colleagues were not only members of the team, but in some cases she would also face the challenge of winning a prize and enter a decision-making contest.
"The special position of the Head of the National Army is that it has been elected by other members of the National Army, so knowing that you have chosen your teammates to seek a very unusual achievement, however, it is a great honor for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the members of the Sugland.
It just shows us how far we've gone.
And they're all the old field activists here, that's what they're doing here.
How's my captain speaking?
Well, I think it's great.
I was just referring to this fact that in this case, we are very happy because we are holding a World Cup in the capital.
Therefore, it is very important for us to support the capital, as well as to be able to grow up by returning to the Olympics.
I'll get a second chance to participate in the contest, and there'll be a lot of talk about it."
In 2016 there were 18 million workers, up to 1218 million employees, with 21 per cent increase.
Critics on your face: If you can't bear the responsibility of the voters, don't compete for public service.
Our father knows what bad media are doing.
The Americans love Washington, but soon the newspapers began to beat him hard, from domestic policy to political principles.
He's very hot for these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't scream at those critics.
Because early in 1783, Washington had said, "The freedom of speech is deprived -- we will be killed like sheep in silence and ashes."
This reminds me of Larry Hogan, governor of the state of Milan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have been excommunicated and eliminated by at least 450 people because they have published their views on his face-to-face official page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union has filed this case this earlier this week.
The officials of the Government considered this procedure to be too draft and reported on their strong opposition on the Internet: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "This is just a face book."
But it's important.
This is especially important, because it's the same guy as Hogan.
This is one of the common party members of a majority of the state, and he is also warmly welcomed.
In the 50 national states, he received the best estimate.
Hogan isn't an activist.
He's stable in control of the state of Milan. He strictly adheres to the rules.
He was also very much better than the main way of putting his face in contact with voters, playing with his head on the front page for the first time after his treatment.
It is therefore not necessary for those who come to the Governor's main comments, but ultimately very dangerous. This page is a public forum, which is an official management platform for staff members who are taxed by the public.
In a "Washington Post" interview, Hogan's speaker, Amelia Shass, defended the Government's actions and said that she felt that their comments were a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a censorship.
However, they described it as a flood or a global flood of landmines.
The Washington Post has spoken to people in Hong Kong.
They are only ordinary people in the leadership dialogue that they choose: they are teachers, small businessmen and priests, and they are not a flood of water.
They are reluctant to express their comments in depth, with respect, and not to go down.
If this priest refers to "the Holy Book" in his pocket, he calls attention to his heavenly faith.
Lakshimi Salma Ramani, chief lawyer in Bui, Mali, did not have a practice of witchcraft, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the part of her commentary on the story of the Washington Post, "I warmly comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like to make comments on the same subject because they are directly ignored by some people who think they are what they are from the public mind rather than make them a citizen of a proud nation. "
The so-called "closed waste information explosion" of government officials appears to be "intention of claims" in others.
A change in information is easy and easy to change in face-to-face times, and only one critic or one negative comment is needed.
It is also clear that it is far more effective than in the past, that in the past century it is necessary to send out officials to collect and destroy newspapers that contain criticisms or arrest or vote against protesters.
But that's really what's going on right now, but it's on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of complaining about others in facebooks and other social media.
President Tranup is being prosecuted by the Twitter user, because he has beaten them on Twitter.
A cross-border decision took place last week in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to regional judge James C. Carcairis of the United States City of Alaska, the President of the London Supervisory Committee violated the first amendment from her face-to- face-to-face letter.
Matt Bewin (R), Governor of Kentucky, was also taken into account by the United States Civil Liberties Union for the use of facial books and toilets.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington’s time, the cost of mail and the Internet had similar effects.
The number of newspapers was reversed between 1776 and 1800, and there was strong criticism of his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also had a flood against him.
They used Urikra, Valerius, Belize, and Podunds to write to the press about the decision-making in Washington.
According to the historical document collected on the website of George Washington, his office was dismissed and his attitude to the treaty on trade and shipping was criticized by the Prince of Great Britain and the United States of America, which he had signed with Britain.
But he didn't scream at them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of expression and expression are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept this.
The city's heavy windmills are moving people's emotions.
The purchase of restrictions is a strong communication between many urban property control policies.
In May 2017, Gingin stated that the grantee had been granted half a year's maintenance and had access to the same housing policy for local residents;
In June, the U.S.A. policy provided for a three-year university graduate and employment certificate to be available at home.
Subsequently, the policy code states that "the university students can purchase less than 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, it was provided that only young people of the University of Field and above-school sciences could apply for a residence permit.
In addition, there are mountains, cities or regions on the coast, such as the seaports, have also been set up to introduce relevant policies and to reduce the threshold for the purchase of houses.
It is believed that this is in fact the most important importance of these housing policies for large cities, especially for the population and for the population, especially for the population.
Some even believe that this means that the time has arrived for the "limited purchase" of the building.

Back in Tunisia, Gary Ol, he was just 50 years old this year, and he also participated in the European regular youth tournament.
This was the first time he attended the Sugran Golf competition since 2013.
Helensburger Ol said: "It will be more important for you to go home to the House of Commons.
You want to do good, but you can feel the extra pressure.
I'm really having fun again. I've been fighting golf.
I am satisfied with the present situation."
The three groups in the area were the winners of the former Grand Instructor Ian Voussan and the regular champions Paul Brodgest, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNutty.

In Beijing, 22 August, the head of the Office of Environmental Oversight Services of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced 57 cases of continuing punishment in total, and a new revision of the Environmental Protection Act, which was implemented earlier this year, clearly reflects China ' s environmental enforcement force.
At present, environmental law enforcement agencies in China can be used to monitor environmental violations by day-to-day punishments, arrests, limitations on property and transfer of administrative detentions, and to punish environmental crimes in conjunction with judicial bodies.
In August, in China, a total of 335 cases were carried out jointly; a limit of 177 cases were imposed; 189 cases were transferred to administrative detentions and 166 cases were transferred to suspected environmental pollution.
Of these, seven continuing punishments are implemented by the River River, which is currently being integrated from border control to comprehensive environmental pollution management.
While economic pressure has shown, the Chinese Ministry of Environment has been clearly demonstrated earlier, China should properly address the position of environmental protection in economic development, increase "green strength", increase economic pace, reduce environmental security and play a positive role in improving the economy.

"We used to cover our bodies with trees."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live below the poverty line, as well as in areas where the highest and lowest literacy rates are among Asian children.
But it's also the Chinese of Indonesia.
There are about 153,000 people in the Paniere area. The largest, the most profitable mining company in the world is 60 miles [60 km] away, which is located at the headquarters of Félippe McMorland.
In 2015, only about $33 billion of gold and silver mines were discovered here.
In addition, the resources of Baba are very rich and the estimated value is $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Cubans, and strong military forces of Indonesia are therefore able to keep them under constant pressure.
A 2005 survey "New York Times " revealed that, between 1998 and 2004, Philippe paid nearly $2 million to local military and military personnel and troops, with a single officer of up to $150,000.
The people of Babab became increasingly stronger in their claim for independence, which threatened this rich man who was subjected to cruel treatment.
According to the defenders, more than 500,000 Bababians have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murder in the 1970s in the Baba tribe has increased as a result of genocide.
Only last year, the Indian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report in 2016 "We will lose all evidence of the evils of the past year, such as extrajudicial killings, of torture - another report, which is said to be particularly widespread - and of the cruel oppression of peaceful tourism.
“Violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims,” said the Indian researcher Andreas Harrisono.
Baba's resources have come to a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and pressure has begun.
There are 83 per cent of the population of the province as Christians, but there have been changes in its population structure since its arrival.
The small value of the cows' food is sold by cadmium and cadmium, which is used to produce fruit.
The locals are trying to fight.
24-year-old Pania's local Apos Yui moved to the province of Chapra, where he explained that "the immigrants began selling beef and veal at a lower price than local Bababians.
This has resulted in the loss of their market for local Bababians - women of Bababa (Mama) " .
President Soko Vidododo (also known as Zokovi) in his 2014 campaign to address the problem of inequality and abuse of powers.
This former wooden road to the palace of President Jakarta was supported by 27 regions throughout 29 regions — including Panya.
But nothing changed in Baba. Today, locals feel betrayed.
In particular, "We've broken our heart, and in 2014, we voted for Zokovi, hoping he could achieve our will and restore equity."
In fact, only two months after the ten-month occupation of Kosovo, Panya suffered the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 of Ennarotali children sang Christmas songs outside of the fire, and two Indonesian soldiers rushed over to the motor vehicle.
Surprising kids told them to open the car.
According to the local priest, Ahuat Tababa, one of the soldiers was angry with them and then brought back four soldiers.
Victims and observers said these drunk soldiers were shooting at these children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot these kids.
The 16-year-old Yulyannus Jim was severely beaten and beaten.
Within hours, nearby government agencies were electing the Committee to build a building with a fire burning in the coal mine, and the second day's event was upgraded.
Some 1,000 young Baba men, women and children, gathered together at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre, requested justice.
They're wearing their traditional beads, jumping the waita dance of the Baba's Mee Pago tribe, and they're running around and modeling.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones into the military.
According to an official document seen in "The Age" magazine, while the situation continued to worsen, the soldiers received orders from the inside radio: " If the crowd is opposed more than three times, immediate shoots " but this document has not been issued to local media.
56-year-old Jeremias Kajama was head of the Kego Koto street area of Ennarotali, where he felt that there would be a danger, that he would call on the people to calm down and ask them to come home.
But no one's willing to hear him.
He stood at the door of his colorful wooden house and told me "When I came back, my left arm was suddenly shot."
Kajama still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from the army.
He also said, "It was so bad, they fired a lot of guns."
According to the local brother, Olf Yull, he saw the gun and saw three of the Orf Yure's men.
Yuhannes, sad to say, "The magazine of the era, "I ran past him to see if he was not.
I found he's dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Chief of Police of Baba, Yuje Mend, told reporters that his sub-mission was only in the "protection" police station, as the police have been attacked.
We must defend ourselves when we are threatened by a person who threatens to kill us in 2015 by police chief Pujio Sulisti.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The next day, news of this murder was broadcast in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi, in Chapra, made a statement in which he expressed deep sympathy for the victims ' families and vowed to address the abuse of authority remaining in the history of Baba.
He said, "I wish this case could be resolved as soon as possible, so there will be no such thing in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Willando, said that he wanted to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the question of the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the reason for the delay is almost there.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to solving these violations, but this requires another process."
Then, on 5 June in Jakarta, Vilando went against the "time" magazine dialogue and said he had not planned to establish a complaint mechanism in Baba.
On the contrary, he said, "Everything will be resolved by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando on more than 1,000 deaths in an independent vote against East Timor in 1999, but he said 11 cases of human rights violations in the Baba region had been resolved, including the Pannie incident.
The family of the victims of the Panie incident was ashamed of these words.
Yuhannes said, "For the past three years, I've been in four interviews, but things have not progressed. "
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He's still living in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yokabus also thinks that the people of Pania are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the army came to see me."
The gun didn't stop.
The second day, the Indian police attacked the village in Pani-Ai's neighborhood.
One construction company manager refused to help transport a disabled man to a hospital, a conflict occurred between the two parties, one death and 17 injuries, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Dowu died on his way to the hospital when he was fishing near the river.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said the villagers were throwing stones at the police, so the police were warning them.
But the Armed Forces (Individual Military Police) started shooting at people and one person was killed.
29 "We were always afraid they would respond." He lived near the hospital and saw the injured being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding in the house for two days."
The DIA Parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and the armed forces to withdraw from the area.
Panie has always been a place for the Government of Indonesia.
Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal are experiencing a lack of effective development, which has spread to the central peaks of the Pani-Aiwa.
Many have joined the Free Baba Movement (OPM), which is a rebel army, claiming to protect the rights of the Baba people through the proliferation of attacks and attacks against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the Free Baba Movement were born in Pania, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kukhaya.
Therefore, for the last few years, thousands of people have been arrested by the military for their "protection of the sovereignty of the State" and deliberately detained.
Some people haven't been here yet.
In the eyes of the Bababians, Panya is a "fortunely forgotten" place.
Poverty's getting worse.
Enarotali's sales are less expensive and locals can't afford it.
It's not even possible to get out of here.
There they will grow all that they can eat, mainly red and some fruit and vegetables.
The seeds are women's work, each woman can take care of four or five red spots.
They usually collect most of the leftovers and place the leftovers on the local market.
Ten Red Reds are worth 10,000 Indian Rubies (75 meters).
As time went by, economic inequalities had spread to the local Bababians and new migrants, and the number of migrants had increased considerably since the opening of the new route to the airport in Nbarre.
The current small amount of work has often fallen into the hands of more educated and wealthy migrants.
Bababians have very little money or the necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
John Goby, President of the Paniei Council, says "Youths don't want to stay in this village because there's no work here or money."
Baba and the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media reporting remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basel Lun were expelled from Baba because they "do not cooperate with the relevant institutions", even if they have been given permission to film.
According to UNOH Vice-Chairperson for Asia, Félim Kaen said that Zukovi ' s withdrawal of the reporting restrictions had not been fulfilled in order to promote transparency and development.
In a statement, he stated that " if foreign journalists try to report to Baba and Sibabaa, which are not in the eastern part of Indonesia, they are at a new risk: refusal of visas and entry into the blacklist " .
No media surveillance means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is essentially limited to neighbouring countries.
In March, 6 Pacific States — Tonga, Peru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate " universal human rights violations of Baba " , including the Pannies shooting case.
These countries have also supported the free Baba movement.
Armanata Nassil, a speaker from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, did not care about the group, and he told the newspaper Jakarta that " Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system and freedom of the media, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations. "
Local people want more foreign Governments to pay attention.
According to one informed man, on 4 May, the delegation of the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador Kess Juan Bartage visited Chapra when the local people broke their silence and asked "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but apologized.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Bababians claim they are not very likely to vote for Kuwait.
The President of the Council of the People ' s Republic of Goba says " The purpose of Zokovi is good, but he is all around the people involved in the Pani Ae shooting. "
He wanted to let the people of Pania know that they were not only at risk of living in the armed forces, but that there was nothing in the region that was too poor for education and public health services.
Like other Bababians, Gobi said that their vote on Kosovo was his duty to repay him.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even in the face of threats and threats, the families of the victims of the Panyea shooting continued to act as a last-significant resistance to the body of the victim in front of the military police station.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not forget their sins.
Yokabus says, "My family has been killed.
What else can we do?"
Sofia, a well-equipped customer, has been developing a large-scale housing industry-based base for hard-to-catch cards. On 10 February 2017, the Chinese witness station approved the first application of a limited unit of flat-holding companies in the Broadway Stock Exchange and issued a small pass on the market platform, which had just been adopted by IPO for more than 20 days.
In the view of the business community, as soon as goods are ready to be moved from the market to the capital.
The delivery of a new year's euphemism to a typical representative of the housing area will attract the attention of the entire housing industry.
The Beijing Times reported that the three-star electronics company's second week had published the main components of automatic car use with Hamman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, which were important initiatives for the company's access to the electronic market.
Three stars got Hamman International about a year ago.
On this week's e-consumption (CES) exhibition in Las Vegas, three stars issued a touch-on warning, a road warning, a camera that controls navigation, which was developed in cooperation with Hamman.
The three-star plan began to upload this year this series of cameras, which was built on engineering such as automatic learning and expansion of materials.
At the same time, three stars have shown "digital tapes", even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle and can make vehicles more personalized, which allows users to download information from moving equipment and from the doors.
This evening, the 20th cycle of CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA season 2016–2017.
The fires don't start again.
On Friday, a fire took place in a world’s highest housing building and forced hundreds of residents to flee the building at 337 meters high and 79 high-level buildings.
It's a second-floor high-level building fire within two short years, and it's just happening in Moseta called "fire".
The building has been disintegrated and no reports of injury have been received and no reasons have been identified.
"We're sleeping, and then we're woken up, and people started crying.
We run down the building and run from 50 to about 10 minutes," a resident named George told the street.
The Civil Defence Authority of Dubai stated that the fire forces were burning fire around 4 p.m. at local time (Ginwig Standard Time 0000) and were being processed for the building.
The Government expressed its efforts to provide shelter for affected persons.
This incident may bring back concerns about the use of external materials security in high-level buildings around the world.
A study carried out after a fire accident in 2015 revealed that most of the damaged objects were decked and detached outer walls.
The British police have already indicated that they believe that the issue of the heat and surface system of London Grenfer Building may have been caused by a rapid fire in June, which caused about 80 deaths.
The Williams Car also indicated that Masa might return, although he had already announced withdrawal.
On 9 January, the opening of the South Ouija board of the Republic of Korea was only one month away, and with the hot and intense efforts of the Ouija board from the south to the north, there was a growing rise in the country's greenhouse gas emissions.
This long-standing Korean conference is expected by the Korean government to bring a "flower egg" for a month when it falls into the Pacific Ocean.
On 1 November last year, San Francisco arrived in Korea.
The heat from St. John's fire is directly reflected in the sale of the door-to-door tickets to the San Francisco Museum.
Just two months ago, the sales rate of the IP was only 32 per cent, and the rate of sales of the IP was more than 4.3 per cent, and the low rate of sales was one of the most worrying external concerns about the public of the IP.
However, as the Chairman of the Committee on Human Rights predicted recently to the press, "as the temperature in the country of Korea increased, the situation of sale of the door will soon change".
According to the Korean media, as of 3 January, the sales of the IPO had reached 64 per cent and the sales rate of the IPO had also been cut by 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreign people to pursue the Korean race, the Ministry of Justice of Korea also announced 8 days that foreigners visiting Korea will extend their stay in Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying contravention aircraft.
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or indirectly carried illegal goods through the U.S. Transport Safety Authority, of which at least 6 per cent of passengers had deliberately carried prohibited firearms or other goods.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers declared that they had found the wrong guns, ammunition or explosives to travel.
This survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and it also found that young travelers are more likely to be ignored.
Recognizing that there were 19.7 per cent of the respondents who deliberately tried to carry TSA-containing explosives in response to the attack, compared with less than 15 per cent of X-generations.
The most common intention is that TSA security personnel are food and food.
More than 3 per cent of those who admitted that they had been deliberately carrying the goods had been inspected, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men who had also indicated that they had deliberately carried contrabanded drugs.
The company claims this investigation to be a number of passengers from the country to be informed of the number of persons carrying an accident and of the intention to carry prohibited goods over the aircraft inspection aircraft.
It is not surprising that the most likely person who has been carrying the embargo is — deliberately or deliberately — the most frequent ones who fly.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines were somewhat complex.
People often don't know what they can carry and how many fluids they can carry.
So the TSA's best payment is that it's not weird.
People once thought that TSA might have turned the book into a contraband.
The domestic aircraft is permitted to carry liquids, but the international aircraft is not allowed to carry them.
The President of the U.S. Environment Agency, Prutt, changed his idea of reducing regulations for the Obama era
After a day of prosecution in 15 states, the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Prutt, changed his decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations on the reduction of air pollution in the Obama era.
This change was proposed by Prut, since the Environmental Protection Agency could respond faster than previous Governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal to his former position.
The focus of the dispute was to set a deadline for the country to start meeting ground ozone standards in 2015.
In June, Prut announced that he would be delayed for about a year in order to allow the Environment Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "intrusion of local decision-making or impede economic growth".
Prior to the appointment of President Donad Tramp, Prut was the Chief Prosecutor General of the state of Ocranoma, who had long opposed the strictness of environmental legislation.
Since its arrival in Washington, Prut has been reversing or delayed legislation against the chemical and fossil fuels industry.
The sudden reverse of the Wednesday is a latest legal obstacle to the Puritan regime ' s return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded the authority to delay the implementation of the provisions required by the Government of Obama for oil and natural gas companies to monitor and reduce carbon monoxide.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prut proposed a major shift in his attitude towards ozone standards and expressed the commitment of the Environment Protection Agency to strengthen its commitments to work with the States to achieve a complex process.
Prut stated that " under the administration of the former Government, the Environmental Security Agency is often unable to meet the deadlines set by the Environmental Protection Agency, and then, for example, the groups and other persons are motivated to prosecute again and again, through the agreement, to determine the schedule of time-limits. " He initiated dozens of appeals against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
" We do not believe in the rules of procedure and we are serious about the deadline.
We are also serious about the rules and authorities. "
However, the statement made by the Environment Agency indicates that Prut might be used again to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policies and best information available".
Co-Parties within the National Assembly are promoting a wide range of revisions of ozone-depleting regulations.
The House of Commons Act, which was approved last month, is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The U.S. Security Council was held this week under the leadership of the Union of State Prosecutor Eric Schmendman of New York, who was about to maintain legal pressure.
“The reverse of the U.S. Environment Agency – following our prosecution – is a significant victory for the health and safety of the 670 million New Yorkers, which has a direct impact on the communities of more than 1.15 million Americans.”
The case was included in the list of States of California, Copenhagen, Tarawa, Ilynoi, Ecuador, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Mexico, Ouija boards, Redenfania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and Colombia.
The soil ozone is a vehicle, power plant, oil plant, and other sources of emissions of common pollutants resulting from light radiation from the atmosphere.
The resulting smoking will cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, resulting in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health promoters and environmentalists welcome the amazing transformation of Prutt.
The Biodiversity Centre stated: " It is disturbing that this conventional measure has been subjected to great pressure from sectoral officials who protect our air needs. "
" We must fight against the thought movement of the Government of Tranup to meet the contaminants and special interest groups. "
In addition to the external factors of the return of the price of the stake, it is difficult for businesses to go down the path of lowering costs.

On 13 July early in the morning of the Beijing Times, the United States company Somaltus submitted a case to the District Court of East Texas in which it alleged that it had violated an electrical technology patent applied for in 2010.
The company had previously used the same expertise to prosecute WAY, the Union, three stars, Sony and East.
According to the case, iPhone 6s and similar fruit-producing equipment violated the U.S. patent No. 7,657,386, which is called the "Comprehensive power supply system".
The complainant wishes to receive cash compensation, or to receive patents for breach equipment declared after the judgement.
From the trial, the prosecutor seems to believe that iPhone's speedy operation violated the company's patent.
The iPhone with its fast-functioning power will quickly increase its power to 80 per cent, and then it will be powered again.
In fact, Somaltus is a so-called "explosive stream", because the company does not provide clear products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information on the web.
However, they have succeeded in reaching external agreement on this patent with the Fort and J. J. Car business.

The Washington Post revealed a record of communication between US President Donald Tranpu and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a call to President Enrique Péna Niuto, Mexico, Tranup urged him to stop openly expressing that he would not pay for the construction of the border wall.

The Mortuary case: The activists are again being subjected to the privatization of racism and spreading justice
A fort star train in 1948 passed through a group of spectators from the small city of Menro, Georgia, heading towards a small Mork Bay.
There were four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and a white man with a gun on his way to the front of the car before arriving at the bridge.
This guy's head -- a middle-aged man with a piece of paper -- breathes a nose and eyes into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are terrified.
"We want to-- Roger!" that man ran.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from his previous guest seat to cry for silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a rehearsal.
However, when Roger's shoes were put on his pockets, almost all the audiences around him were really breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Mordong Bay, and two more events have occurred on the night of the private death of three K parties -- Roger and Dossey Malcon, and George and Mere Dossey -- in 1946.
No one's been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, although we have seen them in the community, they have not been arrested in recent years, which is really hard to believe," said Tylon Brooks, who helped organize this rehearsal.
"This is the point of history, the burden of our souls."
At 71 years of age, Brooks was a former parliamentarian and life-sustainment activist in Georgia.
For him, replay was an interesting call, reminding people of Menro's communities that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to finish, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
" Unless we receive justice, we will not have to be healed and reconciled. "
On 27 July 1946, the testuminant was placed in a bed on the body of a Mortgage Private Prison Victim.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, based on the information received by the United States National Broadcasting Company, 50 men from the city of Menro and its surrounding villages were suspected of being involved in private punishment.
But none of them have been charged.
Although suspects have been in a state of extrajudicial situation for decades, civil rights activists have shown that the double motive for the implementation of the private punishment throughout the city is well known: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled black citizens in the state of Georgia to vote for the first time at the beginning of the election later that summer.
According to the Federal Investigations Agency statistics, at about the same time, Blackman Agroje Malcom killed Whiteman Bannet Hester in a fight seemed to be for a woman.
Brooks said that the city's story was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife, and her baby wasn't her husband.
According to the Federal Investigation Board, on 25 July 1946, a prominent white man, Mr. Roy Harison, spent $600 on bailing Malcolm out.
Dosance and Sister Merey and George Dorsie took him to prison.
But when they got back from prison, when they got to the Moorton Tower, a group of private criminals surrounded the car.
"The fact is, it's Harrison's organization and ordered this murder," a FBI report concludes.
" It is clear that there is fraud between the state and local law enforcement authorities, that they not only participated in the murder and destroyed evidence but also concealed the identity of the witnesses. "
Brooks is very clear.
He said, "This is a voter. "
"They were killed by the killer and sent information to the blacks of this community: 'If you register and vote, you will face the same conclusion. '
In recent decades, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual rehearsal of the Maori Private Prison.
She's a well-founded character of her hands, her touching heart, with a deeply racist background, and many people hope that such racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green says it's the key.
"We don't want to talk about private punishment, because it makes us face everyone's shame," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me talking about my own experience, I can't build a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, and on the first day there were nearly 30 players -- dozens of white people -- the rest of them black -- sitting in one house, listening to a well-equipped show.
Wed Malk is a joint actor in Green.
For years, he's been playing the role of three K parties, but he says it's not easy.
"I feel so bad because I'm not such a person," Malbo said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, the actors from Roger Malcolm and Bannet Hester, Darius Bradsen and Nick Rascona, trained their speech.
At the beginning of this game, Malcolm called out and went to Hessette, and he was so upset about how much he had slept with his wife.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Lascona's back on the way.
Then they broke up.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) shouted.
Green's the best.
"What's going on?" Rascona asked.
He's surprised. He's confused.
Am I over-played?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't say 'aye' when white people come back. "
"Yes," another black actor interviewed.
"Your words must be strong."
Thus, the power in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has gone unsatisfied.
Everyone tried to do this not only to play this game but also to commemorate four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona said this, "When you're angry, you're strong.
No one's laughing.
The replay is strong and quickly over.
It's a silence. It's a silence.
A woman who was dressed in a black dress standing next to the performer, wearing the word "extraordinary reality" by Billy Hackerie.

In addition to a hundred miles, about 40 people are standing in constant contact with the water and the eye.
Nearly half of the population are black and white.
There was a demonstration of a couple from New York Isaaca, and a lot of people lived near the street.
Brooks took them to the tombs at Malcolm and Dossey, which took about eight hours, and everyone was suffering from an inadequate heat in Georgia.
Until now, the killers are still a fraud. But now, standing on the same land where the private punishment takes place, the air is full of tension.
When the last song was sung, Green was invited to the body of close inspectors.
The children are so low, they look at blood and body, they're talking about privacy.
"They're not really dead," said a little boy, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
The performer opens a private trial and wipes out his eyes.
Bradshaw has three K party heads.
Nick Rascona had two of his colleagues crying in their pockets; the emotion in the show finally touched him.
"It's okay," one of them said.
"We know your heart isn't like that.
You're doing this for a reason."
After that, the audience sat down and ate dinner with the performers.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta spoke to black women they had just met and talked about the rehearsal.
Dennis Duplinski found it hard to find words that she saw.
"It's hard to imagine the horrible words and deeds that you say and do, because they look like you," she said.
"For me, it really makes me think I'm still in prison," she added, "and now it's just called a police gun. "
In the room, Tylon Brooks is sitting on the table looking at the table and talking about civil rights.
He says he's already started the show next year.
"Replay is a way of encouraging people, as it describes the terror we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
" If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who don't study, who don't know their own history, are destined to resurface."
The importance of the reform of "independence of the network" for natural gas market reform is not stated, but there is also greater tension and conflict.
Newspapers were informed by the North-West Group at 11.25 p.m. that an explosion of 13 workers had occurred during the freezing of small grouped companies in the city of Gonzhen, in the province of Donson.

America: Scientists at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering Research Satellite for the Cleaning of Space Wastes
On January 18th, the United States media reported that China's scientists had made a very innovative proposal to use a large-scale solar system to clean up the messy earth roads and to destroy old satellites and their space debris.
According to the U.S. Press Week website, on 15 January, researchers from the University of the Chinese Air Force Agency prepared a paper entitled "The Clearing of Small-scale Space Deformation Models", which described how space debris could be less stimulated and without such a large fraction.
It has been reported that over the years, space debris has been a matter of concern to international space agencies, and the United States Space Agency has considered a number of alternative programmes to detect and eliminate debris.
The way in which large-scale space debris is cleared includes large grids for cleaning and collecting waste and can be used to attract particles that are in orbits. China's scientists have conducted a real research on light bulbs and have concluded that this will be an effective way to clean Earth orbits.
The paper ' s summary states: " (Study of research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris technology for the irradiation of space platforms. "
A 2014 study by the U.S. Anti-Fraud Company Lokhid-Martin found that there are about 200 threats every day for satellites operating along the road.
The high-speed segment of the Earth orbit movement is considered a serious threat to future space missions, and experts from the European Space Agency are described as "a threat of death".
Also, according to the U.S. "C.M.M." website of January 17, the space is basically empty, but the earth's atmosphere is getting more and more occupied. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another part of the planet's operation, and as time moves, these debris will be collected.
More and more, some of the satellites that are normally operated are still at a higher rate than those that have been hit by a broken satellite, thus damaging or destroying a million-dollar investment.
It is reported that all space agencies have developed plans to clean up space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the rate of drop-down of debris using explosive gas to keep it out of the way, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large network to capture debris and return it to the planet, which Japan thinks is using a mobile tape.
In view of the fact that China has also proposed a solution to space debris, that is to say, using a large-scale light-emitting device to cut off solid space debris into small pieces that are not so harmful.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering in the German month of Light Science, such a sensor installation on a satellite would be sufficiently effective to clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
It is reported that the only way to prove effectiveness is to test and that there is no arrangements for such a mission, but perhaps early at night someone will install light equipment on the satellite and then send it to space.
Once it has been done, we can finally start the issue of the permanent elimination of space debris.

The latest results of the survey of the age assessment of Swedish refugees
Sweden ' s refugee testing was based on the latest method of medical evaluation of their age, and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of the victims were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not all were convinced of their accuracy.
The Swedish National Medical Centre (R.ttsmedicalverket) launched this test earlier this year.
Following the lack of an accurate assessment of the age of the alleged minor refugee, the Swedish Immigrationverket designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the refugee process.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent 6880 pilots, and the Law Medical Centre has now published the results of a total of 2481 pilots for the period from mid-March 2017 to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 years or more, but in the other 25 cases, the Swedish National Medical Centre "probably 18 years or more".
In 432 samples, the result is "probably under 18 years of age".
Only those who have doubts about age.
According to John Glanson of the Legal Medical Centre, these findings are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These data and the data of the previous months are not very different, and the figures are very consistent. "
The highest percentage of cases where they were judged to be older than 18 are not necessarily reported to have been reported by these refugees.
In May, the Centre published 581 sample test results and said that there were 442 examples "showing that the testee was 18 years old or over".
The Svenska Dagbladet survey of 581 samples published this year found that 243 of them were publicly shown to be 18 years old at this year's session.
The X-ray examination of intelligence, the nuclear disks and the results of the analysis of dentists and radiologists have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects was the interior scholar Claude Macus of the University of Carolina, whose work included assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they were early or late in their normal life.
He told the news paper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the method of measuring should be used.
It's not fair to judge age in such a way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, Glanson, a legal medical centre, has the correct defense for these tests: " In general, it can be said that the uncertainty of a child ' s risk for adults is very small. "
The highest risk is that this person is under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
The President of the Republic of West Virginia announced the exchange of parties.
On Thursday evening, Jim Justice, President of the Democratic Party of West Virginia, announced at the meeting of President Tranup, that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, and the Democratic Party has left me," the judge said.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you today that I'm going to tell you about the identity of the people of West Virginia that I can't help you with the status of the Democratic Party."
The meeting sounded a welcome call.
"So, tomorrow, I will transform the party into a party," Justin added.
"As a teacher, I'm going to tell you when it's time to start another game. "
There was an early commitment to make a significant statement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Mr. Tranup won 42 per cent of the vote in West Virginia, while Justin didn't support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary?
According to "Fobus", Justin was considered the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
"Fobus" notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At present, his body cost was about $15.9 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Parties issued a statement on Thursday evening: " The changeover party of the State party was once again fighting against the Democratic Party, but would not prevent our countries from becoming more large again, but would make our countries more large " .
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 statesmen and controls the minimum number of national parliaments, and the statement by the President of Jastys is that it is the latest rejection of the political party that has lost leadership from above and cannot be found in positive uniformity," stated Rona, President of the National Committee of the Parties, McDenil in a statement to CBS.

Sebastian Koto said that Russia apologized for the "integrity" of incitement.
On Thursday, the President of the International Trade Union, Sebastian Koko, expressed his appreciation for Russia ' s apology for the incitement of drugs and said that it was quite "true", but he reiterated that now it was not the time for Russia to resume its participation in the campaign.
At the International Trade Union Conference, held prior to the World Trade Mark, the President of the Russian Federation, Mitri Hiraktin indicated that his country was prohibited from participating in the campaign and he was determined to fight incitement.
He said he was sorry that "all the players who got money and money in the game had been denied a prize."
Despite such comments, the International Conference on Lands still voted in favour of the maintenance of the ban. A previous report of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) referred to evidence of Russia ' s support for the use of anti-Frauds in November 2015.
"I believe that today's response is very sincere and very honest," the International Union President said to the press.
"The whole Council and the General Assembly are pleased that the Russian Federation recognizes itself as a very busy time, and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the race."
He's also "good" Russia has accepted the standards of the resurgence.
"I think this is a very constructive day, and we believe we have made some progress, but the General Assembly supports the proposals of the Panel on the subject, which is not yet the time for the restoration of the Russian chancellor's qualifications," he said.
" We need to make this situation normalized within the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean movements from contaminated systems," he added.
Nineteen Russians will participate in the World Trade Marks held on Friday, London, in accordance with the strict standards of the International Trade Union.

What effect does the financial rules of the football community have on Neymar (Neymar) transforming Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted expenditure by the European Union Football Club will not prevent Nepal from transferring its prices from the Barcelona Club, Spain, to the Paris Saint German Football Club (PSG), France.
As a result, the European Football Association (EEFA) has been further reduced to the Paris St. German Football Club. The European Football Association is an administrative body in the European Football Games and has the right to ban the participation of the teams in the European Football Union, which is widely concerned.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" (FFP) launched by the European Union in 2011 meant that the Paris St.
The Barcelona Club has paid €2.22 billion ($262 billion) only to pay the cost of the Brazilian football team, while the Nepali payroll tax is at a maximum of $1 million per year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nepal ' s transfer to France.
In view of the funding of the team from the poor Qatari ruling family, the Paris St. German Football Club is of course able to use money-encourage Nemal and integrate him into other prominent stars' teams.
The club can afford to buy a lot of money for its members, but they must use legitimate income sources to compensate for the huge amount of money they have earned so that they can achieve balance in the related operations of the football.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" was the idea presented by Michel Platini, who was elected President of the European Union in 2007.
This former French footballer believes that if banks or all of them withdraw their support funds, they are actually cheating on the risk of ruining the club for those high-ranking clubs seeking success.
In 2011, the focus of "the rules" was to monitor the situation of losses in the club from the club ' s debt issue.
This change means that Roman Abramovich (Roman Abramovich) used a commercial model in 2003 to buy a potential club and then to improve the team and create a global card, now facing a more urgent situation.
During the three-year "rule" evaluation period as of 2018, the club may lose EUR 3 billion.
Despite the loss of the President in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a member of the European Union, remained committed to preventing excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso told the U.S. last week about the future rule and the "Effective Rules" issue.
Although the Paris St. German Football Club will pay a reasonable amount of rent for Sinemal, it can also be allocated within the contract period.
Since Nepal has signed a five-year agreement, the transfer of contributions in the annual accounts for the next five years may indicate the cost of EUR 4440 million.
The first "rules" imposed in 2014 resulted in the most severe sanctions against the Paris St. German Football Club and the Manchester City Club under the Abuzabi flag.
The Paris St. German Football Club was sentenced to EUR 6,000,000 (at the same time the exchange rate was $82 million), then reduced to EUR 2000 million, and requested that the team be reduced to 21 players in the 2014-15 season, not normal 25 players.
The European Union is looking forward to the increase in income through the association of the owner of the club, who deceives the club of the financial control agency.
While Qatar ' s companies can sponsor the Paris St. German Football Club, if the amount is considered to be above the standard market price, the European Union would not consider it legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014 and the European Union decided at the time that the Qatari Tourism Board had approved the Paris St. German Football Club.
It has been reported that part of the income of the Saint German Club in Paris may have been paid by the Qatar World Cup Commission in 2022.
However, it is easy to take such initiatives for the European Union's regulatory body for the purposes of the Paris St. German Football Club and the Group ' s Committee.
The recent sanctions against the Paris St. German Football Club meant that the European Union would be more likely to warn of any open rules.
It was said that the European Union had not had a preliminary discussion with the Paris St. German Football Club on the subject of Nepal ' s transfer.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the United States because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris St. German Football Club.
An account published last year shows that the commercial income of the Paris St. German Football Club was €5.424 billion in 2015-16 and over €1 billion in profit.
The accounts of the previous financial year have not yet been published.
The Paris St. German Football Club is expected by the Federation of Nepal to contribute to the promotion of activities that allow business and the sale of clothing.
The club is expected to sign the Nemal camp income will increase by at least 30 per cent.
It is clear that seeing the greatest of them left, the Spanish Union was deeply angry and tried to prevent the movement of Nemal and claimed that the Paris St. German Football Club violated "the rules".
The President of the Westminster Union, Javier? Tambas, told the Spanish newspaper AS, "This is a clear evidence of 'financial incentives', and the club and the state are the same," meaning Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Paris St.
Arsene Wenger, professor of the Arsene Games (all of the members of the club) at Arsene Wenger, held reservations about the attitude of the National Funding Club and the Westminster Union.
"This is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the entire environment of the last 15 years of football " , said Wung Quartet.
"When a country owns a club, anything like that will happen.
This would make it very difficult to follow the "rules" because for a country there are many different ways or interests that require large numbers of players to represent a country. "

3D people welcome the film's "Fourth Festival" on 25 February, led by "Fourth Festival" and "Court" films, directed by wisdom, filmmakers and filmmakers, awarded by the American director TomDisher an excellent number of films, and shared the following screen stories of film creation.
The "Blood of Good News" was derived from the history of the Chinese culture of the King of the South of China, and was born from the traditional origin of the "Chief of Sin" and became the cause of the "Chief of Sin" and was described as "Bow of the Lord" by an adult who had been subjected to serious difficulties and had a strong sense of dreaming. The film was deeply influenced by local cultural origins in the North Sea.
The armed mountains in the northern ten cities of the North Sea are one of the world's cultural heritage of the United Nations, as well as the origins of road cultures and armed forces, which are known as "The Long Cross, the First Mountain of the Day".
He was led by the play and spent the period before the video was created, and he went to the armed mountains with his team.

It's an amazing idea.
But it's not just an idea.
Some of them have a good visual head (the police watch TV playing games because Americans like football).
And there are a lot of musicians -- including Jenny Spartet, Nick Ofmann, Mahsalakhashbaz Ali and Colo Sevini -- who made a great sound show.
But "exploration of two heroes" is so committed to making a really exciting advertising show -- there's a killer in the drama -- and it usually plays a role like that.
These six-group televisions seem to slow down, and they don't seem to be able to release the effects quickly or frequently.

The Bank of England will maintain a rate of 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England will later declare that the interest rate will remain unchanged and that the previously weak economic growth and slow inflation have led to the prospect of destruction.
The Bank of England issued a warning because it had control of interest rates while strengthening family income tensions, economic growth would continue to undermine the "fever" situation.
The decision-makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a rate of 0.25 per cent of interest rate by 6-2 votes, while the minority members of the month called for an increase in interest rates, even if poor economic growth had reduced the incentives.
In its quarterly inflation reports, the Bank of England estimates growth in 2017 and 2018 by 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, and warns that family income tensions will continue, while inflation will rise to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
In the next few years, however, it stated that there would be a need for a shift in interest rate to reduce the inflation brought out by Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be moved to a greater extent than expected in the financial market.
A year ago, a large number of economic promotion policies were implemented under the influence of Europe, and members decided to withdraw them.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing plan and will start providing valuable funding to the banks from February of the year, although it claims to be in line with that plan, it will now need to add additional 150 billion pounds on the basis of 1150 billion.
In the record of the PPC, the Bank of England stated: " In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in recent times, as the actual income of the family will continue to pressure consumption. "
With regard to interest rates, the series reiterates the need for a "determining monetary policy" to push inflation and a "greater degree than market expectations".
The current market is expected to achieve the first growth in the third quarter of the year and the second one in 2020.
But it emphasizes that any move would be "slow" and "control".
The growth forecast for this year and the coming year has declined, while the forecast is 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
This line maintains an increase of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
The British exchange rate for the United States has dropped, and the euro has come to its end.
The United States dollar exchange rate fell by 0.5 per cent, reached 1.31 per cent, dropped by 0.4 per cent, and reached 1.11 per cent.
Before this constant decision-making takes place, there is a dramatic rise in expectations of destruction due to recent unaccompanied growth data. The second quarter of GDP increased to 0.3% and only 0.2% in the last three months.
The increase in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will increase slightly at the end of the year.
In general, families are plagued by inflation, while pay increases are not sufficient, and the recent inflation reports of the Bank of England have not brought them any good news, as this practice has reportedly become even worse before it changes,
It also claims that monetary policy can't prevent the fight against income over the next few years, but the wage is expected to recover "great" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the enormous growth in demand for British goods, the economy will be motivated and offset by the impact of some low consumption.
The decision-making initiative had been developed a year earlier, with an alarming public in the EU as a result of the bombing of Britain, which moved to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may need four years to fully affect the price of goods and the British economy.
Prior to the publication of its latest rate of interest, the call to the interest rate was not heard because the inflation order had already increased to normal family snow that had been repressed, while three decision makers called for a return to 0.5 per cent interest rate for 7 months.
Over the past month, inflation rose from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England stated that it was expected to increase again over the next few months.
It is estimated that 2 per cent of its target, more than half of which are completely weak, is the final bottom line.
Coreco Mortgage Brokers, director of Korea, Andrew Montreck, said: "In view of the recent decline in interest rates, the loan market seems to become more competitive again, as the lenders strongly appealed for more operations and looked forward to the end of the year with a positive attitude.

The British National Medical Service System (NHS) has a large wave of controversial HIV drugs
After the collapse of the High Court on the provision of NHS drug financing, patients will be able to start accessing "changeable" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that a drug that could be used before exposure to anti-explosive drugs (PREP) has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by around 86 per cent.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Supreme Court's decision last year, which stated that, although NHS claimed that the local authorities should provide funding for such drugs, NHS had the right to pay the costs of PrEP.
The launch on Thursday was announced by Simon Stevens, Chief Executive Officer of the British NHS (Simon Stevens), and the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) called it "key time".
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Livicupur and Sheffield, sexual health clinics will become the first registered sexual health clinic. More clinics will be included in October and will then be fully implemented throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-explosive anti-drugs (PREP) is a pre-sex use to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
The use of PrEP before sexual behavior means that there are sufficient specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be used every day or two hours before sex.
Persons eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transsexual persons and HIV carriers who failed to receive treatment.
The hospital will determine whether the status of HIV infection is accepted by persons who are not aware of the treatment of antiretroviral therapy by participants, including men, women, transsexual persons and their HIV partners.
Individuals living in England and registered as a full-time medical doctor may also participate in the local sex health clinic.
The plan will cost $10,000, while the NHS England branch office has signed a contract to purchase these drugs after international competitive procurement this week.
The test aims to assess the full potential of PrEP through a large sample to collect information on how it is positioned and how it is applied and how it is applied.
Mr. Stevens said: " This important new intervention should play a large and growing complement and strengthening role in the prevention of HIV.
This is another step worth 30 years of action to address the major human health challenges. "
The British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) Chief Executive Officer Jepola? Kim says: "This is a key time to combat AIDS.
If it is indeed aimed at the needs and groups at risk, it provides an opportunity to change the prevalence of AIDS in Britain prior to exposure.
Since September, the HIV-positive group will be funded through NHS through this experiment in England, obtaining a new license, which is truly uniquely implemented without consultation with sex partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We are in favour of this announcement by both of us."

High-quality life: using herb and herb design to build a house that is spacious
Joannie Ray was a banker who was very active in the entire building, and in 2014, she moved from a large house located in the base of the castle to a small apartment in Bourne.
This apartment is located in a beautiful palace of Princess Annie, where Joanne doesn't pick up a chain to sell it, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before this, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house in the woods," Joannie said.
"I was looking for a suitable house at the price.
I saw this apartment in the Grand Duchy, and it's a very high ceiling.
I mean, it's about that day."
This 1,000 square meters apartment has been completed since the first watch of the room.
This apartment was originally a complex unit -- which needed to be moved through the kitchen -- and JoAnnie wanted to increase the storage space and the building so as to make full use of adequate ceiling heights.
"I want a high ceiling, a large window, enough light.
That's my request," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azady from Duck&Shed's construction and design office (in Nodin) to use this 12.5-foot skyboard to build a house. This house is not just a development project or a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceilings is insufficient to increase the two upper spaces, so the challenge of building is to create a high enough building for people to stand up.
Elvan needs to be creative so that he can solve this problem.
"The structure of the wall is quite complex," he explained.
"We must set up space, put it down, and don't need to shake the back.
Not only is it easy to build a simple platform, but it is also necessary to launch these shells so as to enable them to be at appropriate heights around the performance. "
By means of this arrangement, Elvan could have access to two fully-fledged rooms in that space -- which could add many interesting elements.
The building uses Retrouvius card recovery windows to attract tourists to the area of life.
The silver little furniture and Serge Mouille have been recognizable.
The use of the lens plays an important role in increasing the environment and space and light lines.
On both sides of the walkway, it can make it look bigger.
In the kitchen, with a cupboard, it's like a window into another room.
In the bathroom, a small box with chairs provides storage space for Johnny to store food and bottlers.
A beautiful guest room has an exciting feeling of space that can be picked up when the kitchen is not used.
It's not new.
But the uniqueness of this messy kitchen is at the top of a car park.
"This is about knowledge in some areas of engineering," Elvan explained to the door of the MDF.
"This is used as a balanced principle, so when you move forward, it's easy to move."
As a result of the careful use of space and stocks, JoAnni received 16 square metres more than one bedroom and an improved desk.
"In the end, you sell it to the owner -- or say your property value is based on the owner's property," Elvan said.
" Basically, the landlord will go into the room and calculate according to the size of the building. "
They would try to increase the scope of space, while using quality materials, thereby creating a sense of Juana.
Elvan said, "The material is your own choice, so it's helpful to create a sense of humor in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
All these things are important, but they won't touch your heart."
In fact, it proves that by good design and by increasing additional additions, standard apartments can turn into surprises.
Actually, you might be like Johnny. Choose to stay.

According to the latest national public health survey data in 2014, the population of the movement grew by almost 8 per cent compared to 2007.
The two brothers were playing $5 billion in the real estate.
After their Italian family had set up their king 40 years later, two brothers were worth more than $5 billion, and one of the largest sovereign states in Victoria was fighting the Great War.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer, lived in a famous house in Tucara district where three doors were his brother Paul's residence. The latter reported to the Supreme Court on the division of their estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has always wanted to leave the family business, but the two brothers have had a serious dispute over this division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother had 38 estates worth more than $5 billion, which had been purchased by the family since 1973 and had been growing up in the Smithson of Cornwood.
There, the family created Westco Jeans company and gradually developed it into 160 retail warehouses.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
Subsequently, the money was invested in the property of the premises. At present, the D.R. family assets group included the city offices, lessenrick and Solento development projects, the gold coast and the Blore Mountains, as well as the district shopping centre.
According to the agreement reached with his deceased father, his brother Paul named Colin "main promoters and ruling persons " owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul was about one third of the family.
The documents submitted to the Tribunal indicate that the value of the property of Colin was estimated at $3.16 billion and that Paul owned the value of the property at $1.76 billion.
Paul believed that the distribution of real estate and cash proved to be the link between negotiations.
" The property distribution proposal made by Colin left me the best property I think is the best " , he wrote in a first court declaration in 2015.
On Friday, after several mediation failed, the Supreme Court held its hearings for the first time.
Now these two brothers are still struggling to gain control of the existing enterprise, which Paul said had taken Colin out of his office.
And Colin denied it and accused Paul of failing to manage certain estates.
In the early declaration submitted by Colin, he expressed his hope that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian tradition has decided that the family is the most important choice. My Italian blood unit is the most important family," he wrote.
The costs of the case continue to rise, as well as several hundred-page declarations, e-mails, and company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Carter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and two-party fund-raising lawyers.
Ms. Dr. Rutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, have been immigrants to Italy since the end of the 20th century, and they have been operating a large-scale restaurant and restaurant, and in the early 1970s, they have purchased a store in Brussels.
They bought some supplies from the Corinwood industry, where Colin opened the family's first cow shop.
Colin said, "I read three times," and he created Westco there, "and Paul was still very young (about 10 years old). "
Anna, De Rutis, said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer property and land to their son.
"Louiji always told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court at last," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said that when Mark left, he paid $1 million to him and $26 million to Luk.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with their property distribution articles".
According to the post published by Eddie McGuire from 2015 on television, Colin was a member of the former AFL Club, but he has remained a low-level member.
" Fairfax Media " contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
But only Colin responded through a letter. He said that the case had been submitted to the court "I can't really say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very difficult," he wrote.
In 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother ' s demands.
He said: " Our father does not want to see such a dispute with Paul and me at the end of the debate " and adds, " he still hopes for a solution to the dispute. "
Friday, this hope seems ruined.
"Our problem will be resolved by the Court in the near future," wrote Colin.

Media time limits for the President's new presidential plan of Tranquil
Others have tried, but failed.
John F. Kelly might be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first one.
According to the U.S. political media website Politico, the new White Screen Leader Plan restricts the flow of information to President Tranpu — including the media report — with a view to ensuring greater stability for the boss.
The following is a paragraph by the journalist Josh Dossie:
"When John F. Kelly, the new president of the White screen, began his first day of discussion with senior officials, he noted that he was going to address a major issue of President Tranup's entry into the White House: bad news in the President's hands."
Kelly told these officials that receiving good information would help the President to make a better decision, so information would be required by his hand — either in writing or in summary form.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to wear it through monitoring the media time of Tranup, but eventually failed.
President Tranup's TV show has been coming for a long time — now in the White House, and he's still looking at the TV habit.
In February, ex-competitor Sam Naberg told Politico: "If the candidate is disappointed by the unfair report of the candidate Tranquo, then let him know that he has also received the correct report on the basis of his belief.
Tara Parmeri, of Politico, wrote at the time: " According to the experience of six previous contestants, control of the habit of spreading Trannut is the focus of ensuring that certain praise has been included in the media information received by him personally. "
It's all right.
But Tranpe's habit of coercion has been "indicted" in fact ridiculous.
Maybe these competition officials know something we don't know about -- that if they don't have their intervention, Tranup's move will even get more hotter.
We may never know about those twats that Tramp didn't send.
If his staff can save him in the fire, no matter how many times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Taron from causing the dispute.
Part of the problem is that in a white box composed of competing groups, people are promulgating their world views by sending reliable and unreliable information to Tranun.
Politico — all about this story — was well reported by the consultants in May on the provision of suspicious information to the President's strategically.
This is an example described by journalist Shen Gudman:
" The current representative and former Tranun-Pun official said that the reaction of Trannu to negative media elements such as firelights, in particular those with devastating information, would be crazy to find its source.
At the end of February, a copy of an article on GotNews.com's website by the web promoter Charles C. Johnson was posted to the President, who accused Vice-President Katie Walsh of being a source of great information in the White House," when Taranup was such an expression.
Even though John had been imprisoned permanently because of his harassment, no specific evidence was provided, and he had been excommunicated by a large number of misgivings and subsequently openly denied.
Tranun looked at the article and began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Gudmanja also said that at the time, Prime Minister Reins Pribas and White Secretary Rob Bot " had tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Tranunpur."
What's the result?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing, three months later.
He may be able to prove himself to be a more efficient manager of Bipribas, but Tranpu or Tranup of the movement, while his assistants are still competing and fighting for power.
These permanent effects will make it difficult for Kelly to carry out her mission.

Now these small towns, as tourists, appreciate the water of the mountains, read the culture of the desert, feel the important purpose of the desert, and will also provide important assistance for the most beautiful tourist destinations in China.
The relevant authorities of the Provincial Tourism Agency reported that, under the warmth of the small tourist resorts, cities in my province are now more focused on the creation of a personalized tourism industry, that new tourism projects and business conditions are not poor, that brings rich experiences to visitors and has won good results.

The car's on the way back to "The Rich Street"
Some of the richest business owners in the West Bank have repeatedly been involved in the fight against determined housing drivers, who have consulted a government-led robbery and have asked to return their land outside of their homes.
The owners stopped their 20 trailers in an airfield outside the Soliher Street of Pwawa, which is called the "Row Street".
The residents of the apartment were tied to the mats and tied to the child and driver's car crews, and returned after their departure in May, and the city-owned "Purity River" did not prevent them from entering.

The angry population strongly criticized the Solihull Council, saying that it "exacted badly when dealing with this problem".
One undisputed resident said, "They were there in a week's time, before they came to the town of Benesith and threw stones to the people of the past.
The Committee should be ashamed of them as they are, because they are in no position to deal with the issue.

Italy ' s strong attitude towards the rescue ship of migrants from non-governmental organizations
Italy's non-governmental organizations operating in the Mediterranean are being warned that if they do not sign new operating rules, they will have to continue to implement rescue.
When the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Marco Minniti, received a " press release " interview, he said: " If non-governmental organizations do not sign new norms of conduct, it is difficult to see what they will think they will be following. "
The day before the warning was issued in Mainiti, the Italian authorities had actually seized the trafficking of persons by the German Aid Organization on board a ship that had been suspected of "young rescue" and had helped illegal migrants to arrest them.
The assistance organization operates only for one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that "for us, salvation is now, and will be the most important thing in the future, so we are very sorry that we cannot now operate in the area of rescue. "
" After all the information has been collected, we can now only assess all allegations and situations. "
Since October, Italian officials have been monitoring the ship Iuventa, organized by the Youth Rescue Organization.
Its shipowners are concerned about the fact that the trafficking in persons is carried directly by small ships and allow the smugglers to run away and re-use ships.
According to the prosecutor ' s record, at least one such meeting was reported to occur on the seabed of the Libyan Sea, 1.3 miles [1.3 km]. It was published by the Italian media.
Its crew were suspicious of the clear lack of respect for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which resulted from humanitarian warmth rather than any other motive for monitoring rescue operations in the region.
In accordance with the rules of conduct, Iuventa was apparently required by an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the norms of conduct, namely, the Children ' s Relief Council, the headquarters at the Mal his immigration aid station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms of Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that they felt that the new provision was not necessary, but could be accepted, since these provisions would not bring any "significant change and obstacles" to their rescue operations.
A non-national physician (MSF) was awarded Nobel Prize in the organization that refused to sign.
At the same time, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has declined in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ' s coastal defence and the efforts of the joint local mayors have been effective.
The minister said, "In recent days, we began to see light on the streets. "
He announced the plan for a deep discussion this month: to discuss economic development activities with the Libyan mayors and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to suicide for sending a letter to Conrad Roy.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for murdering her boyfriend by e-mail and phone.
This year's 20-year-old Michel? Carter will serve 15 months and will be released for a full period of time.
In June, Carter was sentenced to an unintentional murder offence against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father would say on Thursday: "My family is desperate.
My son is my best friend."
During the waiting period for appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free of charge.
She had been in prison for more than 20 years, but her lawyer's mission thought she and Mr. Roy had a mental illness.
At the trial, Carter stood up, dressed in red and blue shirts, hands clasped, eyes covered, eyes on his face.
" Her act killed Conrad? Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life in order to live better.
She has no responsibility," the prosecutor said.
"She didn't mean any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer says it's "a terrible consequence, she's very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her "age or maturity and that even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of everything he has done for me and me.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, pointed out that because she realized that she could never participate in her brother's wedding or "beautiful" as his daughter.
"The loss of a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and my life will suffer with such pain." she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as the laws of the state of Masaiti did not provide for other persons to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead in a car with carbon dioxide; this year, he was 17 years old.
The letter of Carter showed that she was concerned about his suicide.
"She said in a few letters sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
At the time before he killed himself, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "what you're doing is start the generator, then you'll get freedom and happiness."
Judge Monize said that Mr. Roy's death was a matter of concern and ordered her not to benefit from any media in the case.
There are legal differences in this case.
She was accused of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and declared innocent two years later.
30-year-old Ms. Nox, quoted in a special article published in " The Los Angeles Times " as saying: " Michel? Carter is worthy of compassion and help, not imprisonment. "

The Director General of the Lassa Nett Soccer Club said that the success of the team had improved compared to last year's, and the confidence of the team members and the awareness of the competition had increased significantly. The exchange of athletes and other teams was also more comprehensive and, on the ground, more and easier.
At the end of the match, the Chief of Commands stated that he wished to work hard for the hidden gambling business through the experience of participating in the contest.
It is understood that in Beijing's competition, footballers were overcome by factors such as low oxygen and showed images of the constellation.
Despite the fact that the O.O.S. is a gold mine and that the miners have to go under the sky, the name of the field will be in the wind.
The car manufacturer is in shock, and Ody's gonna change it to 850,000 oil cars.
On the previous day, Ody announced that she would provide more than 350,000 vehicles with software upgrades.
The Prime Minister of Bamaja stated that "the Bamaja believes that there are more intelligent choices than no limits," meaning that European cities - including the headquarters of Bamajam in the country of Munich - consider banning or restricting oil vehicles.
It announced on Tuesday that Europe would be refurbishing 300 million Mesades vehicles to reduce their oil emissions.
No company declared this to be a call back.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have worked hard to expand the use of diesel vehicles to help achieve carbon dioxide emissions.
However, carbon dioxide emissions are considered to be causing carbon dioxide and may lead to carbon dioxide.
The cost of installation by the vehicle company is also increasing, so it is difficult to maintain the competitive power of the oil vehicle at prices.
As Germany's car manufacturer faces a review, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Marker was also accused of over-deploying these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These vehicles are trying to avoid heavy public coverage, that is, concealing their use of the so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions in accordance with the rules of the vehicle test and restoring normal conditions under normal driving conditions.
Many senior officials were accused in the United States and other senior officials were being investigated by the Atlantic coastal States.
Last month, Ody was arrested by the Heat Master before the Department of Motor Development in Germany.
The former Director, Zachero Giovanni Pami, was an Italian citizen and could therefore be tried in the United States without extraditable protection.
Earlier this year, Ody was involved in a criminal investigation involving the general public in Germany, and the Government of Germany alleged that Ody's system had been expanded only to the extent of the United States' investigation.
Ody's investigation may have a significant impact on the public: the Hhowwa car manufacturer has a share of the profits that are less than the share of the vehicle.
A film was prepared to show, from two years to a few years, but it was popular.
The film "The Great Sea" will be released on July 8th, 12 years from the preparation of the film!
"The Great Lakes" by the original authors, 21-year-olds from the University of Chicago's Heat-Effective Business, and a good friendly wedding, were created on the coast day, in 2008, with a risk investment of millions of U.S. funding from the United States of America, and started the film industry's women working "The Great Lakes".
The video has received many prizes from outside countries at the creative stage and has been collected by the French Modern Art Centre Pedua and praised as "one of the most outstanding arts".
For six years from creation to the production of history, it has been known as "the goddess of gods" by millions of first - century poets.
"The Great Sea" tells an amazing story that belongs to Chinese people.
"It's only been doing this for 12 years, now it's become a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited."
He said: "The old man wants to use one of the fifty budgets of others to make the same graphic effect as everyone else, and the team is going to be mad at me."
This "world factory" which has been dependent on the processing of goods and large-scale workers is focusing its attention on high-level people who can guide this city.
The high-level activities of the Government of the Near East City have been held on weekends, and the first financial journalist has seen that some powerful local companies are participating in the talks.
In the red background, they marked the wrong price on the top of the red wall.
Thus, China's Telecommunication Industry Association decided to develop the United Nations Telecommunication Industry and sign the Convention on Self-Delegation.
The Provence tree is threatened by climate change.
Clothing has become a symbol of the southern French city of Prunce, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
The continued drought and the presence of germs containing viruses has led to a decline in clothing that has left scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM), in Provence, said: "The wood-dressing of Ponance is facing a serious threat because the plant has been affected in recent years by climate change, and the rains are greatly reduced and the rains are raining.
It'll affect the life cycle of the clothes.
There is also a smaller body, one that can spread the particles of microorganisms, and in very harsh weather, they will appear. "
The key is its large number.
In addition to attracting vacationers, clean clothes were also used in the oil and fossil fuels industry.
Eric? José says: "In contrast to the many large flowers that can be cultivated, there are many long-dwelling plants, we have a smaller body, a poor development, a lack of or a weak one.
So our oxygen content is less."
The R & D solutions under consideration include better irrigation technologies and mitigation of soil water distribution, protective mixtures of soil and water that are growing on the soil, as well as the development of more colder species.
Compared to the scientific elements in the film, the two main actors showed that they were more attractive than the stories in the video.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the city reporters in Washington, D.C., continued to meet with famous people from many communities, and two voice artists, who were surprised that they were almost silent.
One of them is Berlin. One of them is a senior youth actor, and the first was the "mental crime" of Juan and Leviathan.
The danger of Mexico is serious. The press has been killed.
All members of the Riodoce newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to recall their reporting plans for the riots in Rio de Janeiro, which have been caused by criminal organizations, corruption officials and endless drug wars.
But today, tragic films are covering themselves, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They're told to change their everyday habits. It's important.
The two deep-rooted journalists discussed how much safer people are: they should actually take their children to the office (the office was attacked in 2009) or leave them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
These journalists were given names under each column — without evidence, observation and directness.
There are doubts about drug trafficking, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the list of governments, which has made the news of Mexico very dangerous.
Violence has not stopped, and there are more and more journalists throughout the country: according to the report of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Henrik Bennie Gutto's death in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least 7 journalists have been killed in 7 states this year.
The last one died was their editor and source of inspiration, while the co-founder of "Riodoce" was Javier Waldiz Kadenas.
Valdiz wrote a lot of books on drug violence, which he wrote in one of them: " The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist. "
Everyone could feel deeply that he had left, although he was not there — a large photo attached to the right side of the "Riodoce" office, Valdiz pointed out the word "justice"; and the two 30-year-old journalists, Alan Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, also showed his smile on the T-shirt that he wore his eyebrows or his distinctive Panama hat.
The seminar did not take place until two months after his death; journalists were discussing their common wounds, dreams, loss of sleep and misgivings.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010, only two persons were prosecuted in accordance with the record of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is unlikely that the killers will be brought to justice.
In Riodace, they kept reporting about the violence in the state of San Antonio, although they had already broken their hearts, although the land had been devastated by hundreds of thousands.
Ivara said that there was no information from the killer, no justice, so there was no great use for the holding of a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to take part in such a seminar.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On May 15 in the morning, Valdiz left the office "Riodace" in the capital of Cucuria.
His red-haired carola only opened up a few street areas where two men were arrested; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 guns and suspected that because of the name of the newspaper — translated "Twenty River".
The bastards drove his car away and destroyed it nearby.
Valdiz is 50 years old.
Stay with his wife and two grown children.
Kyria Cana's speech is four times.
But there's nothing more to talk about Waldiz than silence.
Since the last year of Guzman's arrest and extradition to the United States in January, the state of Znaniro has become the most bloodiest place in the country, and the killers of hostile forces are insane.
One or more people were shot every day on the streets of Zionaro, and two graveyards in the grave were filled with toxic waste.
The state of "silence" is temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and traffic routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz is well aware of the dangers of this work, 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director Ismer Poonche is no longer hungry for the protection of his friend.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
The first, 2 months were published by Damasso Lopez, who led a group of cartels fighting several of Guzman's sons.
The report may provoke the anger of these boys, and when the paper was sent to the report, suspect group members bought it.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not forced him to leave Mexico for his own safety after the arrest of another newspaper that reported the same story.
Valdiz was a fugitive from Mexico and abroad, and his death meant much to Mexico ' s violence against journalists.
His spirit survives, his friends and colleagues believe he's been with us.
In 2003, he was also a deep-rooted journalist of Noroeste, who, when he joined five colleagues in the year, created Riodoce, sold 50 dollars.
He said that in San Antonio, "The media can't deal with drug problems. "
With the passing of time, the report gained a good reputation because of the great truth and increased consumption and advertising.
Newspapers like to be able to report directly harmful reports without worrying about them, and readers like to publish stories that are not being reported by others.
"Riodoce" was awarded five years after the creation of Maria Moscapo, a country in the United States of America.
The International Press Freedom Award for Vardiz was awarded by the Protection of Journalists in the same year, which showed his courage to pursue the most real drug report in Mexico.
He said he was scared too.
He said, "I want to keep living. "
Later in October, in a local television interview at Rompevinto TV, he called it "in San Marino, where drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the role of reporters to your task -- either that's how you dress or how you dress.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you say something about what's going on?"
"Riodoce"'s entire staff misses Valdiz, and he misses him as an ordinary worker, and this friend who doesn't care about the recommendations, and this teacher knows how to live.
They depend on his custom.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar in front of the office is always sitting on the same table.
Now they will ask: "Did the custom of his day cause him to fall into ruin?"
His death also made them have to think about how to work well and live well.
"They don't like your problems with their women and children, nor do you like your influence on their legitimate company and the secret airport used to transport drugs.
They're all over their backline."
The result is that, even when it is safest, high self-review and self-defence are required.
Believe in your own ideas.
If you're in danger, get out of here.
"Riodoce" editor Andreis Viral says the problem is, "The air is a feeling of being deceived... and then it's gonna happen like Haveer."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to the state of San Marino — such as those no longer applicable to the state of Tamoripas, the state of Veracruz, the state of Grero and other states, as well as to the private streets of these states, and the situation of the institutions, the corruption of government officials, the smoke.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodoce staff are involved in security training, it is not immediately allowed to use the phone; it is said that just a few days ago, interstellar software sold to the Government in Mexico has been used to monitor journalists and activists.
In addition, two police officers flew under the tree and avoided 104 degrees (40 degrees Fahrenheit).
They are the government's offices to protect Riodace, which are located in a four-level building in the middle of the Kuri Canon street area.
Some journalists joked that they didn't know that they wouldn't belong to 50 per cent of what the governor himself said.
Newspapers have gone to the mountain areas for several months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
"Riodoce" reported three major events this week.
One of them was killed by the brother of Hurio Sesal Chavez, who had been shot by an ex-combatant in the state of Zhenoro.
The government funds of the governor's household are also disclosed.
As well as the kidnappings in a large dining room in Kurya, this restaurant's office is only one street area.
Officials have not published information on the kidnappings and the kidnapping process, so write down what they know about the city: that is where drug trafficking and official love is.
A journalist from public archives learned about the restaurant's registration under the name of a politician of the Party's Political Revolutionary System (PRI), who held political classes almost throughout the last century.
In recent years, several State party rulers of the Revolutionary System have been exposed to corruption in several cases of serious concern.
Viralil asked the journalist to write an incident at the scene, including an incident involving a son of a Mexican leader, Guzman, who escaped military attacks.
If it was a few months ago, readers would look at Waldiz's expertise and find the most powerful information on this kidnapping incident.
46-year-old Viral, because of his body's appearance, was called "smooth," he said, "we've already known what happened.
All of our sources of information are now broken.
Valdiz's office is now being used to store the marks and posters of the protesters, as employees are becoming what they would never want to become: activists on behalf of the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign from the room with his hand and went to the local prosecutor ' s office to attend a visit related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the murder of Valdiz in the western part of Michigan.
An official found a body that was burned and claimed to have been tested by DNA, which was his body.
At the national level, journalists are becoming more and more inflexible, and they are organizing protests, using the words "saving the media" on human roads and buildings.
On that day, the Chief of Staff was not in Washington, D.C., and he was trying to promote justice in the case of Valdiz and to seek international support.
On the second day that Valdiz was killed, Ramirez accused the officials of kidnapping journalists during a meeting with the governor of Zhannaro, and because they told the truth to kill them.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested her resignation from the position of reporting government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reaffirmed that Mexican journalists are organized crime and are surrounded by corrupt government officials and a society that is not interested in the desert.
In his last book "Drug News" he wrote that not only were the victims of drug trafficking but also on the list of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime and corruption.
The Media Monitoring Group, Article 19, will be attacked by over half of the journalists last year by police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they're letting you die to keep you silent."
Obviously, these killings are unheard of.
No one has forgotten six years ago that President Maria Elizabeth Massius died at the border in northern Tamoripas.
Her body had a word called "I came for my report."
Her hair was cut off and put on a computer key and an ear.
After Miroslava Brachi was killed in March, some advertising options were closed, such as El Norte, on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still on their way, but they are still on their way to El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened a public drug dialogue with an article entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or have even left this country.
It's a difficult option.
It's hard to find a job in flight, and they still need to be careful on the streets and alert to danger.
Sometimes they will be arrested and reportedly killed together with four women in a city in Mexico City three months after the flight from Velacross in 2015.
This is the usual stage of high-risk decision-making for those who remain behind the screen.
Ivara wanted to be a witch, and he recognized that drug trafficking made him afraid.
He said, "Mexico is becoming a hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday night, the latest newspaper had been printed, and the editors of "Riodoce" were drinking beer on the street outside the office, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of armed armed forces near the city of Masatran have been identified as 19 dead by the enemy forces and security forces.
The war was also under way, as a series of cartel information had been discovered in the region.
They're on the "Riodoce" website via the phone on the street.
The next day's head has to be changed.
The police are coming up nearby, and there's another gun fighting in the area.
There's a police officer standing there waiting to see if they're alert.
If they had any fears, they wouldn't show up.
The author of the newspaper had died and pointed out in his big picture where all of Riodoce's staff were expected to follow his steps.
"How could you even want to close it on the same day that Haveer was killed and the trainer asked me to send her to the street to report?"
China's 2020 market size or breakdown of millions of dollars from the journey of cars
[A summary] In the context of increased consumption and free movement, the country has been encouraged by national policies and the growing love of consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-sustainment market, which is expected to destroy billions of dollars, is also facing two challenges.
In a large context of increased consumption and free movement, tourism has been encouraged by national policies as well as increased consumer love.
At the same time, however, the prospect of millions of self-sustainment tourism markets also faces two challenges, one in which the development and market needs of the tourism industry are unfair, and one in which tourism companies, such as the tourism club and tourism companies, are faced with very low difficulties; and one in which infrastructure and services faced by the tourism industry are also at an early stage.
As a total of 60 per cent of domestic tourism, market sizes are expected to destroy billions.
Over the entire period of 2016, 44 million people were expected to break down into millions by 2020 from 60 per cent of total domestic tourism.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Railway Association on the number of passengers from motor vehicles, there has been a steady increase in the number of passengers from five years to more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support have been expressed in regions and at the national level in this emerging area of self-sustainment, and the policy framework for self-sustainment, travel and leisure travel has been set up between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Agency, eight sectors such as the National Sports Directorate-General, published "Development Plan for the Development of Vehicles in the Field of Motorcycles"; in the same month, UNMOVIC, 14 sectors such as the Ministry of Finance, "Promoting Rural Tourism Development Upgrading Action Programme (2017)" focused on rural tourism.
Policy exhibitions provided opportunities and policy guidance for domestic tourism development.
It's a big deal. It's a key to the whole industry.
While the potential of the domestic self-sustainment market is enormous, national policies are actively guiding, but the self-sustainment industry remains at the primary stage.
According to "The 2016-2017 Annual Development Report of China, the number of people in the National Sports Clubs, Car Clubs and Car Clubs is estimated to reach thousands of people, but the percentage of self-help schemes for the Travellers is mainly based on their travel arrangements, and the participation of visitors from different types of institutions such as the Sports Clubs is about 15 per cent.
At the same time, self-sustained tourism companies and traditional tourism companies are also indicative of the fact that many are sold on the online tourism platform only by suppliers, and some are important suppliers by self-sustainment clubs.
As part of the organization's tourism activities, it covered "food, housing, rent, renting, buying, shopping" in many ways, high levels of breakdown, high flow supply chains and high organic consumption of tourists.
The founder and CEO of the Bicycle Club of Beijing is considered to be the same in nature and the travel company of the Bicycle Club, and the early main lead model is under-line activities and the core is from tour-line products and team services.
Now, however, the quality of street products in the area of tourism is being severe, and the level of mission services varies, and the needs of the R & D club are being re-transformed.
It can be seen that self-sustainment is not an independent industry itself, but it has created a cross-regional environment, an ecological circle of the industry, and a perfect industrial chain.
The experts noted that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, testing was a more important component of consumption.
Therefore, the development of self-industrial development should be enhanced, the development of self-sustainment+ theme and the IP of self-sustainment products.
It's not just a road. It's not just a parking lot.
In the face of self-resurrection, the basic components of the journey are also more primitive.
Leighe noted that the tourist environment is not only a road but also a need to integrate transport with tourism elements inside, but that the road and tourism sectors themselves are responsible for increasing tourism elements and also staying in buildings, advisory centres, advertising stations, and not high links with tourism.
Building experience is worth taking into account the "66 U.S. road" of the famous self-trafficking road.
The design of the spectrum is no longer the fastest route between the destinations, but is based on the design concept of "tested car interests" and provides the best access to the road map for self-sustainment visitors; the perspectives can point to the connection of the tourist perspectives, preserve the historical value and cultural value of the border's ecological resources, and provide a variety of thematic activities to enhance the participation and tourism experience of visitors and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the views of the camp, the camp is an important accommodation for self-governing.
However, few of the self-sustainment tourists known by New Tokyo reporters choose consumers who live in the camp.
They believe that many camps are preferable to infrastructure, only to meet the needs of food, archipelago, products alone, which include many elements.
There was a lack of openness among businessmen who said that many of the companies that worked in camps years ago had been unable to follow up on the infrastructure and services of the latter, while many of the operating situation had been lost and there had been no late financial inputs and it was difficult to make some corresponding packaging products.
Consumer groups
According to data published by the Chinese Railways Association in 2017, since the age at which the group has concentrated from 21 to 40 years of age, including 31 to 40 years of age, this group has a certain economic base and a higher demand for personalized tourism and more for child tourists.
According to the housing survey, the population of tourists prefers non-standard accommodation.
From a self-sustainment type, around it is the main type of self-sustainment, which is 84.32 per cent.
It's a lot of people's way of leaving, but it's smaller than that.
At the same time as consumer demand increases, visitors from the "Visual Point of View" in the past began to change their views, not "car pictures," but rather more attention to the test and process of travel.
Terroron uses fake clothes to avoid enemies.
Look, it's terrible, but it looks like a beautiful picture.
Researchers have published the first study on the size of the canals found in Canada's mining industry, with an unintended biodegradable result, indicating that the fossil remains complete and therefore have been described by experts as "Monalysa of the Terona border".
This respectable stone has been preserved very well and can even determine the color of its skin as red. This means it has some "dangerous experience".
A related report in the journal " Modern Biology " describes it as " the best preserved humour found in history, as one of the best examples of terrorism in the world " . "
The diamond is a new species of fungus found, which lives between 1.1 billion and 1.12 billion years ago.
Its storage condition is very perfect and surprised by the researchers who describe it as "very exciting to look forward to".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this type of landmine has been the most perfect conservation of the same type since history.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk found this concrete stone when it was mined at the Sungor Million Mine mine near the north of McMurburg, U.S.A.
At the time, he was confronted with something that didn't look like a rock around him, so he decided to look carefully.
After that, he discovered that he was sent to the Royal Canal of Terrculgo biobiology.
The 6-year period when the study personnel were lost revealed the real sight of this wild animal hidden inside the soil of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
With such hard work, the final results can now be published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said King Taylor's biologist, first author, Caleb Brown.
"It will become one of the most beautiful of scientific history and preserve one of the most perfect characters of terror -- Mona Lisa in the terror zone."
By studying its skin, researchers have discovered that although it is toxic, it is like walking tanks, but it is likely to be threatened by a major threat from the meat trolley.
It is used by many modern animals as a means of avoiding the use of such heavy-boiling terrors to avoid predators and to adopt so-called anti-smoothing techniques.
The expert said that it could be better integrated with the environment in such a way and thus avoid the enemy, indicating that it had been captured by a larger terrorist.
This 1.1 billion-year-old-old animal belongs to one of the family of the Red Cross, which was the first newspaper to be released in May and is currently being shown at the Royal Museum of Biologicals in Teresergu.
Mark Mitchell, one of the team's team members, spent 7,000 hours carefully studying the faces of the giant and calling it "Boreelopelta markmitchelli".
The model was well preserved and enabled Dr. Michel, as well as the international scientific team, to record maps and shapes of the bees and bees.
They found a "reconnaissance" that is a common way of protecting the animal environment, which means that the back of the animal is darker than its face.
Despite the common occurrence of anti-cancer techniques, the results are surprising because the body of such a virus is far more than the existing animal that uses anti-cancer techniques.
Such terror is faced with pressure from the killing of meatthirsty terrors, thus moving towards a positive direction, enabling them to hide in the pit as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals, such as rats, horses or other animals, are as small and vulnerable as animals, indicating that the animal is facing real life pressure.
"The great catch of fatty livers shows how dangerous the white blood cells are," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their shells likewise shows that the hormonal skin color is red.
Scientists are continuing to study the lifeline of the animal, including its preserved nutrients, in order to find food that is finally available.
They believe that when he died, he sank into the river and was then thrown into the Great Sea and finally drowned in the bottom of the sea.
At that time, the climate in the province of Eberta was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may now be deeper into the land.
Brown said: "It's really amazing that this end zone is covered by a fully preserved skin, and so far it has been preserved in space so that its original form can be preserved. "
"Therefore, the shape of that organism is almost the same as that of the White Age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The White Age was a time when large-scale foot-and-mouthed horrors were on the surface of the earth.
Despite being the king of terror, it appeared only after millions of years of terror.
They include high-density, a 6-tonnes, 38 metres long (11.5 metres).
The latest research has found that scientists who now believe in the journal "modern Biology" believe that after the end of the cycle, it was thrown into the sea and then formed a tree in the soil.
On 21 March 2011, Finnk landed at the thousands of mines near McMerburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-manufactured hormone, and it's perfect for skin and tissue in areas from the nose to the bone.
This biomedium is about 18 metres (5 metres), with a height of 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20-inch angles, rising from the edge.
Researchers believe that this landmine virus is now active in the western regions of Canada and then flooded into the sea by flooding.
However, such a graveyard allows its remains to be preserved completely.
Such a special sample of fossil remains perfectly preserved and remains the remains of the remains of the remains cover an inequities of the skull of the thoracic head.
As Michael Greshko wrote in "national geography" magazine, this level of storage is just as beautiful as in the Middle East.
I think it's hard to believe.
The remains of the skin ammonia are still covered on the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of
Its right front is on its side, five feet up.
I can get his ammo statistics out."
Newspapers were aware that the addition of natural or plant-based marine oxygen classes, corpus acids and acidic acid supplements to the production of carbon dioxide can have a positive effect on traditional compounds, which are formed by hydrochloric acids, carbon dioxide oxides, and carbon dioxides that are used more commonly than 5 × 10 percentage points.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for crop growth is clear, especially the quality of the BB.
The total number of security personnel is more than twice the number of security personnel in London City in 2012.
To ensure the security of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil will launch the largest security coalition plan in history.
In the past, the Government of Brazil indicated that there would be a total of 850,000 military and police personnel working side by side, including 20,000 military personnel and 650,000 police officers.
Most soldiers will be responsible for the protection of Oo transport station, while the new 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for international airports, railway stations and street security.
The police are patrolling other parts of the city, including the streets, the public and the streets.
It was reported that 6,000 soldiers had now arrived in Rio to serve as security services for Ombudsman.
They are also responsible for patrolling the main roads of airports and airports and O.A., in addition to the four major areas of Rio de Janeiro.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service sector was not a new matter, and it was important that the evaluation mechanism should be effective and that it should be more effective and non-transparent.
How do terrorists learn the answer to the question: "Who's way?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Farrell was shocked.
On the first day of his visit to New York City, this Saint Louis sat on his favorite bed and watched his face on the phone.
She sometimes found a high-end cat.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he was lying on the street."
She found no one else to publish this information, and she's very confused.
A @TheePharoah user keeps sending her a motion message.
Michael Brown was an 18-year-old black man who was not carrying weapons and was killed by a white police officer in Florence, Missouri.
He posted a picture of a bronchial missing body on the street and his body hung on the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrel thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her phone until that evening she reopened the tract and read a text about the gathering of the people of Kampfield.
There's a picture of the police and what people call a scream, and there's a picture of a man named Brown's father, which says, "The Frogson police just killed my innocent son!"
She saw a message from a local police station with a dog stand in front of a group of protesters.
She said, in another video, another cop picked up his gun and called out: "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrel recalled.
"It's not what we're used to, it can be called a typical murder. "
At that moment, I felt so tired.
I'm angry. I'm crying."
She's on her way back. She's home the next day.
At 11:00 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
For the next three years, what happened to Ferrel and Förgson was the theme of a new film "Who's Street" that appeared at the theater on August 11.
It is a story about living and protesting, love and loss, power and strength from people living in this community that meets the demands of the big street.
Férel and his daughter (with flowers, with ornaments) drove to Förson, and again discussed their discussion several times before that morning, "The experience of black people and the situation of black people".
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people must fight for their faith?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, that's not right.
I have to take her, "Ferrell later.
"The thing that's happened today is everything that's happened...
She wants to know, see and wake up from this thing.
She not only needs to develop well in terms of promotionalism and organization but also to learn about different dimensions of the experience of black people and the situation of black people and what we must do to gain freedom and freedom.
Even though I'm happy to provide her with the experience of racism that she has not experienced in her own body, she has nothing to do with other black girls.
If I protect her in this thing, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first station in Förgson, a place facing the South Carolina police station, where passengers were forced to wait until the result of the last prosecution of police officer Darlen Wilson became their camp.
Férel and her daughter contacted a local business boss who made lunches.
They've got a bag ready to deliver it to the protesters.
Gradually, Ferrel began to form a new type of activism.
She said, "My enthusiasm for progress has changed completely after 9 August. " When Louis University of Missouri, St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Minority Hospitals and was concerned about food justice and health gaps in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met with Sabah Foleyan on a night's tour.
Foleyen says what happened with her film director Lucas Alvarado Faler "just wanted to record."
"Are you going to record or want to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people -- usually white -- enter a community to benefit from their suffering and perseverance.
"We have heard that the people of Förson are not focused on their voices, but we want to do it in different ways."
Forlejan is already in contact with a joint actor, Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his campaign against the perpetuity of dead prisoners.
His participation led to the "Who Street" project team, which had not been left unattended for several years after Brown was shot together with six other locals.
"This record is not spoken to us or to us, it is our speech." David said.
"I'm particularly concerned about how these people appear, because it's also the way I'm shown. "
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrel's experience – but to show this movement "not about the world's leaders, but about community involvement," Foley says – the fact that she is the most open of the film participants.
As a result, "Who's Street?" Surprisingly recorded Ferrel's personal life, such as entering the river of love and getting married.
"I feel like I'm ugly," Ferrel laughed when he first saw the stuff.
" But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people must have certain vulnerability. "
In addition, Ferrel ' s story reaffirmed and re-established the role of black curvature women in a broader black life event.
Two of the three authors of the campaign -- who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 Black Young Trevor Martin shot in 2012 -- were identified as cool.
"The black and black women in the leadership are all involved in this campaign," said Ferrel, "that is because we are constantly fighting on many lines of war.
The black and white women must accept all of this. "
Félejan agreed and referred to " The movement has truly received support from black women and many black women. "
Because of her identity, Ferel was selected as the center of the video, but she insisted that "this is not a certain action for things".
"She's a man of power," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence because in the life of these cross roads, as a black whore woman, you've got a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
At the same time, in Frgson, the media have already disappeared, but there is still a strong racial relationship between communities and police.
Because of trying to block high-speed roads during a trip, Ferrel was sentenced to more than two and a half years ' imprisonment.
She described the social political environment of the area she called home: " A bad group. "
Nevertheless, since she had been on the streets of Försen three years ago, she has been holding on to the sacred songs she has been trying to remember.
"We have the responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must support each other.
We're no longer lost, except the locks on our bodies."
In fact, online translation services had already been provided over the past decade, and in fact earlier, the argument "mechanicals are about to replace human beings" had never been heard.
Similar: DNA created by the artist Chelsea Manning
In the center of New York Freedman american exhibitions there are several fronts: white, black and red, and there are similar similarities between each side of each side, and these are lined down from the ceiling.
This 30 film was created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg (Dewey-Hagborg) using Chelsea to send her face prints and haircuts.
Mannin was released from the prison in Liverenburg and was sentenced to 35 years in prison by secret diplomatic telegrams via the Wikidz-Qi.
The exhibition opened on August 2, entitled "The same place".
This is the result of a two-year message from Haggburg and Manning. Duweh Haggburg combines his education with his own technology, computer science and art, while Mannin is a well-known diverse political observer who has entered and completed a sexual operation in prison. The former U.S. President Obama has three days before his appointment and has forgiven her of the rest of her punishment.
Its comments are both multiplicity for DNA and the concept itself.
The name Bradley Edward (Bradley Edward) who was born in Manning was publicly recognized as a woman during her teenage years. In 2013, he was convicted of 20 allegations, including 6 interlocutory offences, computer fraud and theft.
In the prison, her image was framed, with only one picture, a black picture of a black man who had a scarf, seemed to be obviously uncomfortable, sitting on a chair, wearing a golden fad.
In 2015, Histerdouwe Habog achieved great success in her 2012 project " Stranger Visions " .
In that work, she used a paper from the middle court of tobacco and oral sugar to create similar 3D human imagery from DNA derived from fragments.
That's an e-mail from paper magazine.
"They want to meet in prison with Cheri Manning and need a picture," Hessedow Habog told the media at the opening ceremony.
She couldn't watch it or take it, so they contacted Cherie and asked if she was interested in making DNA photos.
Thus, this artist and her prisoner, José, became an impossible friend and exchanged many letters in two years.
They even created a film "pressure film", drawn by Shoili Kanungo.
And Obama asked her to be released a few days after the publication.
In addition, there is another deep interest in this event, because in the United States of America, the Government of Tranquo continues to declare war on government secretaries and mutinies, while finding new ways to do so in the form of promotions, which is to bridge such divisions.
When asked about all this special time, Hesterdow Habogg said, "There is reason for anything that happens."
In an artist's statement on the wall, Manning's super-significant signature is below (the name "i" is drawn from a heart) and calls for the end of "by sex, sexual orientation and culture-based parties. "
On the front wall is her cell DNA sequence, with a cross-sectional twist, Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nuclear acids, a complex scientific dictionary for each artist), Hessedow Habog wanted to express at least on the physiological structure, and everyone wanted to do so.
"I hope people will get out of this situation, our genetic group will not care who we are, how we read the public genetic data, how they are, how they are, how they are, how they are, how they are, "and how they are the subject," said Hesterdow Habog, his 2007 film production "a false memory" was also being shown.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so it's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in one room, comes from a page in the front cover.
The U.S. soldiers showed up under the expansion machine, which was designed by Kim.
"When they stop your talk, they win," wrote on the wall.
"So don't shut up. "
"These items came from her letter to me," said the artist from the city.
"I'm scared again. I'm still going to say it."
Mannin has not yet seen this show herself, as predicted in the film, but when she does, she will be welcomed by her own DNA camera, like a group of protesters at the center of the exhibition.
This is also intended, as is the case with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of her genetic data collection (2.2 meters, Mannin's body height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I hope they think they're like a group," said Doweh Haggburg about the picture.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters with Cherie, just like people were going to release her. "
Professor of the University of North West and staff of the University of Oxford were arrested for murder.
The police indicated that a man was found injured in Chicago City, where a professor of the North West University and a staff member of the University of Oxin were subsequently contacted and is currently looking for suspects within the country.
The record of the Cook Court shows that on Monday, 42-year-old Wendm Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen had been ordered to commit the death of Metrenton H. James Conner Dolanlo without a warrant for murder.
According to the document record, 26-year-old Conner Duranol died of multiple injuries.
The community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body was found on 27 July.
After the police got on the phone to the Grand Plaza apartment, they found how much damage was done to the victim.
The police claimed Conner Duranlo's death and were investigating his murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007, Lesem has been a professor of microbiology and immune sciences at the University of North-Westphalia.
In an e-mail statement by the Deputy Director of the School Relations Service, Alan K. Kobechi stated that Lesem is now out of office and has been banned from entering the North-West University.
Kobechi said, "This is now a criminal case where the relevant authorities are investigating and the University of North-West is actively involved in the investigation. "
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail statement, the speaker of the Samuvir University of Oxin stated: " We have kept contact with the British police and are always ready to assist the United States investigative body as necessary. "
The statement adds that Wallen's colleagues were deeply shocked and wished he could vote for himself.
The chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Gollermy, strongly encourages suspects to take the lead in the authorities.
Gorelmi said that "The police have already had an idea of their fate, and we are trying to establish a possible location. "
Gülermi stated that local, regional and national authorities are working hard to assist in the search for suspects.
Gülermi stated that the police had received a call from the Director of the Grand Plaza apartment, and he had just received a secret statement that 1008 of the apartment had occurred.
The police said the situation was terrible.
Gülermi stated that it was still unclear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July.
He said, according to the security picture, he confirmed Lesem and Warren at the time in the building.
"We believe that Professor Leesem and the victims have a certain relationship," Gorelmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the population that " police are currently investigating the timing and background of the cases of the victims and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents " .
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the world's path map in the near future."
The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, said that the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Fraud Body (RUSADA) would not take too long.
" The implementation of road map standards has already been carried out at a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test plans and tests in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutt.
In commenting on the second part of the World Roadmap "compliance with the provisions " , the Deputy Prime Minister Mutko set out the criteria for restoring the rights of RUSADA and recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutoko, the criteria do not include any of the things that may cause Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be declared and everything will be implemented.
And in the near future, the results will be submitted to the International OIC and WADA. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list was that Russia's anti-emergency agencies must publicly accept the results of investigations approved by Canada's lawyer Richard Michaelon on WADA in support of the use of amphetamines in their national sports campaigns.
In this regard, Mutt said: "We are investigating that our immune system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not recognize anything that does not exist. "
Mutko responded to Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Fraud Commission.
Smirnov recognized the existence of Russia's anti-stimulants institutions in the Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added: "We have said many times in various places that the report contains positions and provisions of dispute.
No one planned to accept the report without conditions," Smirnov said.
In November 2015, following the outbreak of amphetamines, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out an antipsychotic inspection in Russia.
However, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate checks under the supervision of international experts and UNHCR.
WADA, Director-General Olivia Niggrey, when visiting the organization at its headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "in the right direction", trying to restore its rights.
For computers, whether gambling or national gambling, the defeat of humanity has not been under way decades ago.
Daww-Suk, President of the Croatian Federation, said that China's participation in the interview was significant for Croatia's football, and China's prize numbers were very high.
We don't have to buy any more than 8,000 products.
The Department of Commerce, in its regular press release on 11 January, stated that there are currently 15 self-trafficking agreements that have been implemented by our country, involving 23 countries and regions, covering over 8,000 zero-rate import products.
At the same time, imported goods, third-country fishing, Chinese red wine, Asian hot fruits... you don't have to buy these products for money.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have been implemented and over 8,000 imports of zero duty are covered.
For example, with the implementation of the trade agreement, consumer products can be obtained from different sources for a four-year period of time, with quality and priced agricultural products.
For example, the Astana roses, the roses, the hot fruits such as the fireflowers, and the import tariffs fell from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
(a) The import duties on third-country fishing in Iceland fell from 10 to 12 per cent as zero-rate;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs fell from 14 per cent to 30 per cent as zero duty;
There are also higher taxes on special agricultural products, such as beef and milk products in New Zealand.
Industrial goods, for example, were reduced to zero by Switzerland ' s partial import tariffs;
Substantial import tariffs fell by 50 per cent and would be reduced by zero tariffs several years later;
Korea's electric fridge, electric kettle, molyknee and sweeteners have reduced their import tariffs by 40 per cent and will be reduced by zero duty several years later;
There are also higher taxes on electronic products, such as consumer goods.
At the same time, zero-tax products under the trade zone also included the intermediate and raw materials required for the production of domestic end- consumer products, as well as the structural increase in national consumption.
The Department of Commerce's press speaker was very proud to say that almost one third of our total imports could benefit from the treatment of preferential tariffs for trade agreements, most of which were final consumption and brought real benefits to consumers.
Further reductions in import duties on consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, our country has adjusted the import duties of certain consumer goods and has further reduced the import duties of consumer goods, covering food, health care, drugs, daily supplies, shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and various types of consumer goods, including 187 8 taxes.
The average rate of taxation for these products will fall from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost by "floating"!
Since 1 January 2018, our country has also made partial adjustments to other import tariffs.
(b) Import duties on processed textile products, including beet, glasses and water, fell from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
The reduction of tariffs means that consumers do not have to buy and that there is no longer a need for foreign products that are preferred outside the country of old age.
The 2018 import of goods: imports of red wines, cereals, fruit... are easy!
Outlets: U.S. marketing regulations vary widely.
New Internet Power 29 December
According to the U.S. "World Day" report, the Christmas season is just over and it's over.
According to the U.S. Broadcasting Company (ABC), over half of the goods sold last year were returned.
In addition, a number of readers have been deceived into buying explosives networks and consumers need to be more concerned when buying non-formal websites.
In general, large purchase companies have formal and reasonable disposal procedures, but if they buy gifts or electronics from some small shops, they must be careful.
Ms. Rolang's local sister bought an outlet on a web site that was sold on 1 December, with more than $60 (US$, respectively), resulting in no delivery.
She sent a mail to her client, and she couldn't answer it.
There are other Web-based explosives, last year's U.S. travel, buying a cell phone to third-party sellers, where it was found in a box of leather.
Upon being deceived, the website's application for a rebate was requested and full rebate was received.
However, there are also clients who believe that the site's retirement service is not one hundred perfect.
A North American resident king said that he had purchased twice a site ' s emergency delivery service, once a four-time service, but had not been sent in time.
After that, the application for reparation had not been answered.
Large markets or purchases have better returns policies.
Macy's spent most of the goods within 180 days.
But the goods must keep the original "like" and buy certificates such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no evidence, customers can also obtain a market share and can be used to purchase other goods.
Target is normally 90 days for general goods, and electronics are usually 15 days.
However, electronics purchased during the period from 1 November to 25 December 2017, the period of withdrawal of recreational goods was up to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day retirement period begins on 25 December, which is to be reimbursed by 25 January 2018.
It's very expensive. It's a new generation of commercial purchases.
More than ten years ago, our country was also on the market in general, with limited choices and needs.
However, after decades of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the market to the market for buyers, and now consumers are enjoying a better taste, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "hand hand-held delivery" of goods.
As a result, how consumers were given a very high purchase experience has become the next point of competition for land-producing developers.
However, the impact of the shopping centre in the business circle is of the greatest importance in many factors affecting consumer procurement experience.
See how city-builders are focusing on the acquisition experience.
There are no two completely the same plants in the world, no more two completely the same shopping centers, and a well-known shopping centre must have its own features.
For example, Kanyon, a shopping center known as Turkey, was inspired by its unique construction of a well-known bogeyon from Canyon (Canyon), so it was named Canyon, so it was located within a 200-metre walk of the canyon's central minister.
In addition to the design of the canals, there is also a large-scale circular exhibition site in the centre of the shopping center, which is unique and often features special performances.
As an open platform design, it allows visitors to travel at every level to watch the activities carried out in the "Chief Hall" and have the effect of changing perspectives.
In the country, the South-Westphalia Business Street, known as the leading Chinese forest pro-consumption, will bring together the goods and the environment and will be perfect for children.
7000 square kilometers of land, 3,000 square kilometres of water, a project consisting of 9 units of buildings, a combination of space between buildings, and the entire basements designed to remove the French grasslands from the ground as a platform for building, a watery area of the house, and to create a sense of forest.
Walking into the woods, like a bird that accidentally dives into the Elyssey's memory, the trees around the trees are built around the building, the trees, the leaves, the leaves, and people into a forest filled with organic and alive.
It is also in the process of rejuvenating the well-being of the Red Sea, planning hundreds of businesses, planning for the future to enter more than 50 international-level special retail shops, and more than 100 international-level cards and 500 foreign-named cards from abroad, which form a collection of services industry, thematically distinguished commercial centres.
In addition, the well-being of the water industry will also be integrated into the building, leading to the public transport of TOD, the collective purchase of goods, services, food, entertainment, education and the movement together, while bringing consumers to the experience of highly purchased objects, and lead them to enjoy a unique "water culture", which will bring them together together with water and recreation.
In general, a part of the room has now been discovered in this new urban business, while business people have indicated that it is focused on consumer testing and how consumer models combined with testing will also be the main focus of future urban development.
The current trade circle is not only a collection of goods, but more is an integrated culture of art, a complex place of creative themes, and also a responsibility for people living in the city.
Therefore, while consumers are satisfied with the need for a steady exercise, the largest transfer of cultural art and living needs, which are essential for future business development, must be high.
On the resurgence of the famous North-West Bank, on the north coast of the country, near the sound tower, near the world's business fair, around the world, around the edge of the globe, one piece of card collection, and close to the international time.
It's going to take a walk here, and it's going to be a great world.
The East Bank has a better purchasing environment, and the East Bank is located near the South Bank, enjoying a four-dimensional system of transport that is even the leading country in the West.
(a) In addition to the benefits of the work path and of the two-way greening of the countryside in the Wadda districts, there has been a recorded improvement in the landscape, the cultivation of approximately 300 acres of tomatoes, the transformation of the area of 40,000 square metres and the expansion of the South-West Chamber of Commerce;
And the Red Sea is nearing the first low-pressure water trade point — a nine-circuit water cycle, surrounded by nine parks, a low-pressure, open-up area of the commercial street, making people more willing to stop, stay, enjoy the goods slowly, rather than rush into the front of the people who are behind, and actually achieve "progressive purchases".
Today's commercial competition will only become more intense, and how to kill a bloodthirsty in a highly characterised market, gain the glory of the "purchasing holy land" in the hearts of future consumers, which is worthy of serious consideration by all real estate producers.
The single detached strategy is not far enough, but only those who really put consumers in the heart of the consumer, who are in a hurry and think that what consumers think is possible for the development of very, very short purchases for consumers can laugh at the lakes in the markets in which there is a storm.
Of course, by the end of the day, I would like to have the most happy or resuscitated people who have such a good purchase experience and business circle and no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Materials: Consumerism has hidden real environmental prices
It is $182 million, which is the sum of the consumer's consumption in 24 hours of "The World Fascism of Christmas" on 11 November 2017.
In particular, after the "two 11" is started, the short three-minute delivery of the baby will break into 100 billion, 6-05 seconds more than 200 billion dollars, and 9 hours will destroy 10 billion.
On that day, global consumers reached 148 million dollars by paying the total amount of their valuables and 41 per cent more than last year's growth.
These consumptions will bring back an estimated 812 million items.
And whether it's a satellite platform or a payout platform, it's all part of the Ali group.
Ten years ago no one would have thought that on 11 November, a single youth from a culture of self-contained "light" will be eccentricly collected as "two 11" purchases at the present level.
On 11 November 2009, Al-Bababa used the first commercial head of the "Chief of the Light": no one talked to you about love, so let's buy "one dog" quickly.
As a result, this day's treasurer city (formerly "the sky cat") fell to $52 million, 10 times that of the daily transaction.
Since then, "Two 11" has become a popular purchase party made by Arbaba, from the start of the domestic buyers have become self-sustained, to the present day of the global trade, nine years ago, the "two 11" billion-dollar transactions have been more than 3200 times that year, ordering "Fifth Black" to watch the Moss.
There are a lot of electricians who are the most powerful of them.
"Kinoth" has its own purchase segment "6.18", but no "two 11" has a significant impact this year, from 1 November to 11 this year, "Kinoto" has a total sales volume of $127 billion.
And after "two 11", the next thing that's like "two 12" is crazy, the New Year's shopping archive.
Over the next year, China's consumers were waiting for an annual procurement period before the spring season, for lovers to buy, spend, and not leave.
The environmental problems resulting from long-term marine consumption have caused concern for professionals and institutions.
According to The New York Daily Telecom, the normal standard for each pack of 0.2 kilograms in the business is maintained, resulting in at least over 300,000 tons of waste during the "two 11" period of this year.
The head of the Greenpeace Project Project to Combat Pollution in East Asia told the interior dialogue that this year only 160,000 tons of waste will be collected by the scheduled units of "two 11" only on Sundays.
The National Post Office has issued a report in 2016 on the rapid increase in the period "Bi11" (11-16 November 2015), using over 300 million packages, 99.22 million packages and 169.85 million metric tons, with a length of 425 square metres.
This year, the National Post Office is expected to have more than 15 million operations on "two 11s".
The head of a gas station in Beijing told Newway that the wastes that entered the "two 11" every day were more than 2000 tons and more than the processing capacity of the gas stations.
Fast shipping companies have already realized that environmental pollution caused by rapid delivery is not visible.
Before "two 11" some commercial enterprises, including the Sun, launched a re-use of recycled plastic boxes, which could be re-cycled as packs of goods and wastes, but which did not increase consumer acceptance.
The mahogany also supports "green packaging" and "green material" in the micro-biography industry.
It's got more than 68,000 "Wows".
What kind of move do the Germans want to pay?
Winter: Movements launched in Germany are not expected to pay for the war.
Micro-credit payments and precious payments have moved the battlefield into Europe, the competitors have not changed, the capture has not changed — Chinese, is it globalization?
There's a rich place to pay. There's got to be a small loan.
In accordance with the agreement of the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, micro-mails were paid to Germany in November of this year, and were gradually operated by traders within Europe.
This two-year-old national reconnaissance took place in Europe.
For a long time, payment of wealth and micro-credit has been paid on the way to globalization.
With regard to the globalization of China ' s migration, the "Third Third Party of China 's Industrial Payment Studies 2017" summarized two types: one through strategic investment, experience in export, unit membership and support foreign land movements.
The second was through the consumption of Chinese tourists and the promotion of services to foreign traders, which changed the awareness and acceptance of foreign land payments to Chinese movements.
Of course, Chinese have to get under the sky.
China's economic development is rapid, as is its population base. China's tourism in Europe is one of the most expensive.
However, it is also noted that this time China's movement in Germany was not expected to pay for the war.
The payment of micro-credit and the payment of valuables has moved the war scene to Europe, has not changed, has been stolen or has not changed — or has it been globalized?
A more expansive survey is that China's movement is able to pay for landfilling in Europe?
For example, in Germany.
The "new sale" of magic.
Zhao, Zhao Qao: Amazon declared military stores and vandals at the time of its entry into the global retailer, whether on time or on the motif.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first entity library in West Asia and then opened two libraries in Portland and Santiago.
In Ibe 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and planned to have at least 8 shops by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that no one under the flag would be able to run the Amazon Go test, that customers would not need a series or an account, that would leave the goods they wanted, and that the purchase would automatically be removed from the Amazon account of their customers.
In the case of Amazon, it has been a very rare thing in recent years that it has been unusual to act in an entity store.
As CEOJev Betzs, in his 2007 "public letter to the shareholders", stressed that it would not be easy for Amazon to open an entity store unless it met the following four conditions:
1. We must be confident that this new opportunity will enable the shareholders to return their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the entire company;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make a difference to customers.
The bookstores and counterfeits are the most popular category of wanton sales in the two entities, as well as the first opponent after Amanda's awakening.
Amazon announced that the two entities marketed at the time of its entry into the global retailer, whether on time or on motive, would be fun.
Amazon's practice and the assurances contained in his letter are against each other?
The other side of the planet has heard similar voices. On 13 October 2016, the President of the Board of Directors of Albania made a speech on the theme.
He said: "From the beginning of next year, the expression 'electronic commerce' will no longer be mentioned.
The age of pure electricians will soon end, and in the next decade, 20 years will have no electronic commerce and instead will be replaced by ‘new retail’.
There will be a new sale under the line and a combination of materials. "
On one occasion, the three words "new sales" were used as magic, often by businessmen at the mouth.
But what does "new sales" really mean?
If it's just linked to the line, it's not new.
In 2016, eMarketer followed up with 180 largest electricians, estimated that the total sales of electricians amounted to about US$ billion, with the largest 25 of which amounted to $1590 million.
Of these 25 families, 18 were traditional retailers who started on the line in the last five years (e.g. Messie, Nordstrom, Target, Gap etc.).
And there are 283 million of the Al-Aribaba groups in the Sunni unit, as well as in the course of the event.
From a global perspective, retailers and electricians are moving from one channel to an entity-covered store, electricians, mobile and socialized media.
Is the "new sale" more a summary than a future prospect?
If not, what's the difference between the concept of a whole channel?
Maybe the key to the problem isn't online and it won't be integrated under the line but how.
Recalling the past 20 years in the retail industry, the rise of electricians, such as the rise in early years with retailers, focused on prices and facilities.
Depending on these two pain points, the electricians transferred high standardization products, such as books and CDs, from the line below to the line.
As the online custom of consumer cultivation and customer experience continue to increase, electricians are also exposed to other types of goods and begin to increase efficiency.
With the encouragement of Albania ' s CEO, "Utilizing Internet ideas and technologies to fully reform and upgrade the total number of existing social retailers, enables China ' s increased consumer consumption needs to be effectively met and the process of production, communication and services across the world is becoming more effective because of the Internet and the widespread use of data by China ' s consumers. "
Thus, the path of the electrician is a light-looking asset, a path of real-time assets.
"Little" means fixed assets, staffing, management processes without traditional retailing; "best", means a huge investment in materials and storage.
The change in the mode of movement guarantees the efficiency of the electricians.
According to the Chinese Government Network, the Prime Minister of the State Department strongly chaired the holding of a regular meeting of the State Service on 28 April, which held that increasing domestic consumption needs was an important initiative for structural growth.

On 18 January, on the occasion of the reconvenement of the Conference on the Eradication of Electronics From Poverty, Al-Aribaba announced a new "Internet + Eradication of Poverty" model to facilitate the rationalization of the eradication of poverty and rural life.
This was followed by a rural strategy to launch rural mining projects, an online poverty eradication platform, and the establishment of the Al-Kali Poverty Fund after the establishment of the Al-Babaat Fund, and the "guarantee" for the fight against poverty.
Eradicatement of poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total eradication of poverty in China has never been achieved in the past few thousand years.
“Electronic poverty is a new innovative initiative for the development of poverty eradication, an important key player in the eradication of poverty.
The central importance and point out that the Internet can play an important role in helping to eradicate poverty, promote the effective eradication of poverty, eradicate poverty, and enable agricultural products to move out of rural areas through the Internet. "
As a result, in 2014, Ali proposed rural strategies to calculate and globalize large data gaps and to be listed as a three-year core strategy for the future 20 years of Ali.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural mining project to recruit "Little II" in rural areas, bringing farmers to poverty through the e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali, in cooperation with the commercial sector, created a growing channel of poverty, which currently covers 13 provinces across the country and 120 national poverty zones.
There are 2118 beautiful villages on the Ali platform.
Nearly 400 out of these countries are poor, 33 out of 13 countries are poor.
In 2017, the country's national value-added village sales totalled $1.6 billion on the Chinese market.
He expressed his courage to face a national strategy to eradicate poverty, and Ali had been thinking about how to use the best technology for Arab economies, large data and computing innovation to get out of poverty a new way.
The village was the main platform for the removal of poverty by the Ali electrician, and a direct-destruction Internet route was channeled out of the poverty line.
In the plant cycle, rural and mountain-based clothing is jointly supported by agricultural materials and small loans.
In 2017, 795 of the 832 national poor-level poor people served as goldsmiths, providing them with an easy payment, credit, etc.
The food cane is managed by storage and flow, which is responsible for sales, which is directed by large data sources of rice to agricultural production, which further improve supply standards for agricultural products, quality and market competitiveness.
The development of electricians from poverty not only requires products, sales routes, industrial planning, but also requires people.
Ali, through the opening of an electrification course at the University of Wyoming, has taught farmers standardization, qualityization and scaled-up farming methods and has achieved a combination of "poverty and caring" to enable farmers to overcome poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of the national poverty line.
And the "good-willing attitude, commercial means" approach to poverty can also guarantee that Ali will make "the most miserable" when he is in poverty.
The President of the Governor-General of Alabama stated that poverty eradication should be divided into poverty eradication and poverty eradication and three phases of prosperity.
Poverty is the allocation of fish, the removal of poverty is the allocation of fish and the creation of a "fish" for farmers, making it possible for farmers to feed.
The industry's powered against poverty is the production of fish.
In terms of industrial poverty, Ali, in cooperation with the Sierra Leone River, has been promoted as an example by the relevant sectors in national copying.
Ali has also been approved by the decision-making level.
E-enterprises represented by Al-Aribaba have been sent online to ensure increases in agricultural production.
A number of small and medium-sized mining and mining workers were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in the eradication of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme Office in China has been working with rural communities and is implementing the e-commerce industry in the same area as Anguilla.
The new financial message was held on 16 January at the Institute of Ari, in which China saw the "third New Economics Conference" held jointly by the Ministry of Commerce, which was attended and spoke on 16 January.
She felt that our globalization had actually ignored the most important issue, namely, the physical and useful issues of globalization, as well as the phase of globalization.
Many people feel that globalization has stopped, and many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, are different from those of the model.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what is the extent of the medium-term restriction of globalization?
The restrictions imposed by the economic environment base are because of changes in globalization.
In the view that the global economic adjustment was essentially completed by the end of 2017 and that a new cycle of growth would be introduced after 2018 and the next cycle would be the production slow.

In addition to Ali's box, Ali's life, the eternal super-species, the Susin's life, the U.S. fishing farm, the "new retail shop" began to build and even at the price of innovation.
Where has the new market become a phenomenon in the field of opium?
"In 2018 we will soon enter the country, before spring, in Beijing, over the sea, and the state will open a large store."
The "new method" of 2018 was released at the second New Market Conference on 10 May 2018.
" Since 2018 the box has been not only a live electrician but also a living-class electrician who serves consumers.
Under the core model line is inflation, testing, real sales on the line."
Unlike traditional wholesale shops, supermarkets, boxing in many consumers' eyes are a "net store", even some middle agencies have opened up the concept of "boxroom".
The telecommunications platform and retailer under the line have various advantages, while consumers are in many channels, so both parties are trying to complete the channel model.
In the business, it is believed that, in the large context of increased consumption, the "class of horse" portals in 2018 will increase.
The box, on the other hand, has continued to explore more areas of consumption from the first generation to the new year, and the retail market is expected to be more innovative.
"For example, the online mode of operation attracts consumers' eyes, and the open live supermarkets are called good."
"But these relationships are more and more useless, and I finally realized that you didn't bring a good test to consumers, and I tried to buy a list. "
It appears that under the new retail environment, consumers are accustomed to changing habits and purchasing demand.
In the original line, the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is broken, and the line is attacked, now it's joined, because consumers are no longer separated from the line.
The fight against capital has led to the fact that new fossil fuels currently represented in the capital are being spent in the capital market.

Total sales resales of records increase speed back to accelerated routes
Since 2006, we have been able to say that our sales on the Internet has grown too fast and that it is expected that the child will think that the Internet is new and that there will be no way out of the door to buy something and it's cool!
Since 2013, however, online sales have started to decrease to less than 50 per cent, and in 2015, the first time the increase has been 40 per cent, and the increase has become 26.2 per cent in 2016.
However, this year's situation is not the same. The net sales rate has doubled, and this year, from 1 September to 34.2 per cent.
The growth rate for 2016 was higher than in 2015.

Amy Erett once wanted to create the happiness of the company's investigators in her early e-commerce, but the investigation had nothing to do with it.
The response received is often unnecessary, useless, and even worse than false.
Despite her commitment to the use of nameless forms, some workers still do not believe in this process.
Eret, responsible for managing the 75-year-old Banking Electronic Business Supply Company Madison Reed, stated that "the lack of consistency and objectivity in the response received".
So she called for help outside.
A number of new human resources companies, such as the rain and rain, have been created to help companies understand the feelings of workers.
They designed and authorized software specifically for measuring the participation of staff, thus enabling companies to carry out rapid civilian testing for specific groups and groups of people, provide staff with names and complaints lines and, in some cases, allow journalists to report directly to the Board of Directors.
"Now, you can track your health status through tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit from company?" Glint's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Banett.
Eret said within three years, she had received more opinions on the ideas and feelings of staff members using Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and civilization of the specific team, Glint also provided a map of the company, which units were at the top of the complaint, which of the managers were low in number of approvals, one of which made it possible for her to understand why.
Companies began to realize that they had to be trained to manage their company's job culture so as not to be a next priority. A blog post described the disturbing environment prior to its work was published, and the speakers were punished by the company, and the advantages were later distorted.
For a company like Glint, the company's desire for supervision is an enormously profitable business.
According to data from the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020 the value of global governance, regulation and co-regulation could exceed $1.187 billion.
Convercent of the original creation company in Darfur, Colorado, committed to helping companies to prevent and detect misconduct and saw an increase in interest and activity in this regard during the early years of well-known losses.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including his favorite, soft, and tesla.
The advantage of the recent contract is to become a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can send a structured "research" investigation to the company and collect confidential responses in time to look at the map of its problem region.
Convercent also provides an anonymous letter hotline, making employees report bad behavior.
If the Director is contacted, the complaint will enter the Board directly.
The founder and chief executive officer of the Convercent said: "The Court has denied the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company has been found to be ill-treatment workers or to show misconduct against employees, even if the regulatory authorities are not involved, it may also face consumer restraint, with high consequences for the loss of workers and for the involvement of the proceedings.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant with over 500 locations and over 25,000 employees, which has been used for over a year by Converter to ensure that workers understand working standards and work procedures and provide easy access to company headquarters.
In the meantime, if staff members want to report problems, they must find a telephone number or e-mail at their headquarters and submit formal complaints and wish that Headquarters could deal with this with serious concern.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, and Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser, James Vitlano, said that he felt there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.
But now that the company uses Convertert, it will be able to find and solve problems that are unknown to city or state authorities, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay.
"I can be closer to 360 degrees fully aware of work experience," said Vitrano of the ruby Tuesday Risk Management Team.
" We are protecting our units from being subjected to employment proceedings. "
Künland stated that since the closure of the Andor accountant's services because of the security of information in violation of the moral standards, companies have begun to focus more on morals, values and employee employment since 2002.
But until "Social Media enters its own world", companies realized that they could not prevent their explosives from spreading on the Internet.
"Before the use of technology surveillance, people viewed hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Converternt both provided their software as a service and collected regular costs for companies to collect products.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by risk investors, who have provided support to these two primary companies.
In February, Convercent collected $1,000,000 from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whose total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $1,000,000 from Bessemer Venture Partners, which totalled $6 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, cultural and risk investments, these investments are not surprising.
A growing number of studies show that staff are higher than expected in the workplace today.
High-paying and interesting projects in highly competitive markets such as Hong Kong are just a little bit of a joke.
Staff members wish to feel accepted and valued and feel their time spent on a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voice is heard and their work is useful, they will be more committed to making it a success," said Vice-President Nina McCartney of the Global Welfare and Staff Experience.
Investors are able to make a return on the good performance of their investment group companies; the company is good when it is loyal and respectful to employees.
If third-party analytical tools are committed to increasing the integrity and integrity of workers, they will also be unable to find financial support.
The cultural experts at the workplace say that data on staff are very important.
However, these data are of no use unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If the change is not rapid enough or there is no progress, it may lead to disappointment and to the separation of employees from the company.
"If you want to look for 4000 recommendations, you need to prepare for 4000 dialogues." He saw errors that some companies were too dependent on data collection.
"Because if it doesn't work out, the staff will think, 'Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?"
Eret stated that Madison Reed is now conducting a monthly staff survey and has been able to take action on the day of Glint's report.
After gathering staff on their feedback about their decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to address the problem through the reorganization team within the company to increase communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is receiving new views on its staff, and from a long distance away they hope to be able to move into the so-called high-performance industry and better retain workers.
"If you don't want to create a transparent culture, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
"If you lose someone, you will lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAA Cancel training twice a day and extend training time for the white bear.
At about 11:00 p.m., a team of football team members from the University of California met at the new campus.
Some of the members of the team have left the movement and have revealed the body that they are trying to train behind the back of the train on the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, it's a few minutes of rest.
The members of the summer course will return after three hours of training, after which they will return to the final test for the accommodation period and return to the Waterman Football Centre at the meeting on the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days is a match for these guys," the team coach Jim Mora said when he was about to enter the second week.
NCAA has abolished two daily training (with a view to reducing the burden of gambling), but actually extended their training time in white days - at least before the end of Friday.
That's why the first three classes of the University of Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adapt to the schedules that have already been set up by the players.
From one day to more than one day, two day training took place, one week earlier than the previous season, and the first time in the six season in Westwood was training in the summer school.
They planned to start 18 training courses from August 20 and then to start an official race for the first month of the Warde State.
Mora said he supported the adjustment of NCAA's rules, although this would also increase the work of the players.
"In three or four days, we will give them a great amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just adopted, they're training, they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday, we'd have more time, really great."
At the end of the camp, the University of Los Angeles will stop training. In view of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center's clean-up line, this is not an easy task.
At the end of this week, the team will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that when these rooms are aired during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really disturbing problem, which is that someone might rent a room and sit in a training area in the room, which is not a strong idea.
If you have a training video, it's good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures at the 8th stop.
We'll use the available resources and do the best we can.
That's what I'm not worried about.
We have a plan."

On Thursday, the facebook announced that more potentially malicious articles would be sent to third-party testing agencies and show the results below the back.
In its statement on its website, the face-to-face company indicated that the face-to-face will start using updated machines to study the possible drawbacks and send them to the verifier and may show the actual results below the back.
Facebooks were criticized as one of the main sources of so-called false news, and many believed that it affected the 2016 US Presidential election.
This issue was also a major political issue in Europe, which was the subject of widespread corruption of false story before the May elections of the President of France, and Germany had adopted support for the sanctions plan before the September elections, and it would be punished if social media networks were not able to eliminate hate in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook indicated that a new fact-finding test was under way in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, the author of the Facebook release of products, Sarah Su, said: "In addition to seeing what stories have been questioned by third-party verifiers, more background is expected to help them make a wise decision on what to read and share.
She added that the face book would continue to test its "relevant article" function, and that other changes would be made to its information in order to reduce false information.
Create a map: The story of England's castle
Recently, small Scotney City became the capital of the printed music video and once became the refuge of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.
But Scotney's 700-year-old motion history has been on the right place in the Beckle River, Kent, and now it is a source of inspiration, written by Jamie Rhodes (a special love for history documents, and remains a leading Yorker).
"You can see the signs of the ancient 300 years ago, I find it so beautiful," he said with his eyes wide open.
"What kind of person it is that makes this belief fall in my hand."
Over the Middle Ages until the time of Edward, "An English castle" had been recorded by families living in Scotland, each with different stories, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book on the archives of Rose: he also wrote "the teeth and other stories of the dead in 2014, a book published by the British Library, a work completed by him by the creation of an uncontrollable spirit.
He said: "It is impossible to force my writing to take effect at the moment I see the fingerprints left behind by the letter, which was written by a double agent working for the 18th century for Yabbe. "
"That's his finger!
And the message has always felt like a piece of smoke, because then you need some light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel like they're with us.
Oh, I like the text of the file!"
For those who are driven by old newspapers, it seems great to have the support of the British National Commission on Trust and Art and lived in the castle for nearly four months (the "actually, my time is short").
Rose spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castles, refurbishing archives, researching many of the treasures and toys of the garden, such as on the walls of the sheepfolds, and several centuries of bottlenecks.
He walked on the ground and wasteland of old castles, chatting with fans, gardening, and sometimes painting artists in his book.
And then at night, he'll be "drinking whiskey, then writing."
The history of Scotney's secret history is still unclear, since the British National Trust (National Trust) went into full entry only after the last successor, Elizabeth Hessie died in 2006.
After ten years, when Rose arrived, staff began to process the file, which he described as "The people of the past hundred years are going to go: "Oh, put it in the building." "
The newspaper, a letter from the British Empire, describes the map of various countries: "You would think the land dispute would be a bit of a joke," Roz said, "but two families would make a big deal of it for a white tree.
Let go, guys!
Some of the stories in the work are starting as a starting point and are being studied more widely in English history, including "The Laborer" (The Laborer), which is the line of those who left the new building to participate in the 1381 agricultural survey.
The story of "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" recorded an explosion in the city in 1380 " , says Rose.
"Agricultural farming begins in that area, and I think it is a good place to start farming.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as "The Priest" (The Priest), which tells the Darrell family's story of a seven-year period of religious reform during the British Church.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story, was 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was considered to be the one who held his funeral with a stone-full of stones (his remains were discovered on the ground several years later).
"The Darrells" is the most popular Scotney castle family in Rose: "These men seem to be too busy to borrow money and spend more money on things they can't afford.
I think that the Darrell men of the second century were supposed to solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy women, and I think they should be a brilliant young man and understand how to pursue women. "
As he finished his assignment in the castle, Rose began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a painting for two weeks in the wilderness of Finland, which is about "El âm ânm? âki", a 20th-century early hospital, which was subsequently abandoned.
But Scottney has a special position for him.
"I'm sorry to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to go face to face in a real life."
According to news reporters, the head of the Smart Car Team is located on the coast, and the operator is implementing the Deputy Prime Minister's lead for the promotion of communications.
Who's the richest member of the global energy company?
Last year, a well-known PFC energy company published a high-ranking energy company in 2011 with an estimated $40.3 million in value for Exson, U.S. natural gas producer, followed by China's oil and the Dutch royal gold medal.
In this list of PFCs, medium oil has been questioned twice in 2007 and 2009, and the other year's lead position is occupied by Exson.
Among the 50 strong lists in 2011, there were three companies from within China, in addition to the 2nd grade of oil and 9th of China's oil mining and 15th of China's marine oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, although the current oil price was far higher than four years ago, PFC Energy Company CEO noted that there were many factors that led to a low market value, including the decrease in natural gas prices in North America, and the decline in global stock markets.
According to The New York Times, the temperature increased from 16 days to 19 days since the recontamination of the Künzin and the surrounding areas, and the North Sea rocks, which were gathered together and there were "explosives" in AQI.
U.S. Amendment of the Blue Card
The media appealed to President Donad Traunpe ' s statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to modify the provisions of the Blue Card.

The new provision was submitted by the Communist Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two Chambers.
The U.S. media called on Tranquo to " This law would reduce poverty, increase wages and save millions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the U.S. distribution of credit cards to other national citizens.
The Act will replace the current programme to reduce the number of migrants.
This new application process is in favour of speaking English, having financial support, and having an applicant with skills for economic development. "

For the environment in the optimization area, construction of the United States of America, recently "636 " Voluntary Service Team " has been conducted "Den Mountain Forests, Preservation Camps" environmental security activities.
The activities not only received support from the Ministry of the Whole of the Ministry of the Interior, but also attracted the Ministry of Retirement, one of the employees and one of those involved in environmental security practices, three-year-olds ' hard work, mining, cleaning waste, and dedicated their own strength to building the "Mélynja" .
This volunteer service activity is designed to protect South-South perspective resources, to promote the concept of volunteer service "to care for others, to care for society, to care for nature" and to enable the next generation to receive and distribute voluntary services from smallpox.
Since the establishment of the "636 " Voluntary Service Team this year, 16 members of the Joint Development Group have been visited by poor vendors to help the tobacco industry, a series of voluntary services activities such as the earthquake in Yaan's country, and become a volunteer force for the transfer of energy from the heart.
In the eyes of reporters who regularly reported on the project, the "Hide" post section had become the potential of the next Lindan.
According to the Department of Public Information of the Ministry of National Defence, the two Central American parties had a friendly consultation on the success of the transfer of unmanned passenger aircraft in the South Sea on Wednesday, 20 December.
In recent years there have been armed competitions in the field of human wisdom (AI) such as Hong Kong, micro, Amazon and Facebook.
The sex organs are getting excited, but we should be careful.
As soon as you think it's no longer different in 2017, a new technical development report has been published in the area of sex-eating machines.
Yes.
Now it's a big deal.
Recently, FRR issued a report that looked forward to the development of the next five to ten years.
Thanks to the professor of engineering and human wisdom at the University of Field and FRR and co-founder Noel, we need to start with the rise of serious sexual emotives.
Customers can choose the eye color of the machine, the form of the milk and the type of the ring.
When Shaki released his new report, he said: "People are laughing behind the back, but big companies have actually introduced a lot of sexual fans, and we will see more. "
Modern love plants have evolved from the air bubbles into machines, they have their skin, they are warm and warm and, in particular, the use of human intelligence has created a sexual response to human waste.
Users can also "definite" their machines to satisfy their own taste, from the eye color, from the form of milk to the type of ammonia or color.
But it's even more disturbing that a lot of "personal" machine owners will make "copying" look forward.
Modern love equipment has evolved into machines with a nylon skin.
For example, RealBotix machines can be self-defined based on what users consider to be attractive, such as shame.
There are also Roxxxxy Gold sexual admirers developed by the True Company, who can predetermine their characteristic features, including a slightly decoy of "fractional" and "dangerous venture" .
"Roxxxy Gold machines have the same personality as you could," True Company website said.
So she loves you, she hates you.
She's got little affection like normal people in those days!
She can breathe, she can talk, she can say, and she can say, "Sexual"!"
The rise of sexual organs has brought a lot of insecurity — not only in exchange for real human relations — but also in the female characteristics of breast cancer, as well as in the cold (read as: refusal) of rape on Pharaoh's body.
True Company puts Roxxxy on its website as a threat to men.
The website says, "If there's a threat for a woman, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?"
However, these sexual organs are not a simple charm, nor are they just a sexual attraction.
Their appearances and their growing skills point to more darker and deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality and going to the ministry to add to the choice of sex.
Of course, most men do not have sexual anesthesiologists, and although FRR notes that sexual anesthetists are increasingly welcome, they are still at the edge of consumer culture.
But something that comes from across borders can give us insight into the process of our time.
Many people were not prejudiced or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become such.
These specific sexual organs are at a time when the rights of a global woman are threatened, and there is also a presidential lie against sexual violence against women, which is not consistent.
The TV drama "the story of women" is the most exciting part of the world, not the real face, not the body with the covert body, nor the eyes with the two eyes hidden, but the very real idea.
The Republic of Chile is a leap, but it does not seem to be far away.
The aim of these sexual educators is to create as many as possible the body of the most real woman as possible (even though it is a proportion of the sex star).
The Creator of these machines wants them to have human touch and to model real human activity.
But frankly, their "personality" cannot represent real women.
They can't break up or leave.
They have no assistance agencies or follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no full-fledged idea of slavery.
In other words, they're loving slaves.
Or according to the 2017 regular statement:
"The Long City" has been described in ancient times as a story of a Chinese superpower protecting humanity and a war of death in a long-standing city known for its fame.
The last part of the fourth cycle of "Runaway Brothers" has been recorded, "The Chief of Men's" received on May 30th, the news of the Day of the Day, and the micro-confessed interviews of "Runaway Men" in the "School" to "School Angels", and "Funny Men" and "Smoking Men" and "Smoking Over the People" are constantly changing from "Strengtheners."
"The same thing I'm not going to do, and keep up-to-date."
The great success of Tramp?
Mitt Romney is the most famous film ever made.
Political differences have brought two extreme divisions of U.S. voters, and from a micro-spectral point of view, they have destroyed the United States family and family, which has been uniquely seen for the first time in the Tranque century.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, U.S. newspapers are full of fears about how to respond to the voter's family.
We usually think we're doing our best to break our "survival."
Less comments are made about the power of Tranup to bring the family together.
I mentioned this because of my sister, who lives in Chicago's left-wing country, who has been out of business with our family, and he's coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminds me that solidarity and mutual opposition can have a powerful effect.
Because of her collaboration with Tranpu in the White Cross, all she knew, including her fellow party relatives who had been in political conflict for decades, now suddenly and unexpectedly stood on the same line of war.
If it's all on the table, it's a good thing, but I'm surprised that, from a broader point of view, it's going to cause a great risk.
Although left-handed people have been subjected to persecution from Tranpus since, he has been the presidential influence that has moved us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trannon, we mean the possibility of anxiety, that one day his excrement might stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term perspective, which is the relationship between right-wing parties and right-wing parties, which has been contrary to Mr. President's standards before, and which is now suddenly seen as a sign of rationality.
I have discovered that I have recently discovered some strange memories of Mit? The old Romani version: the price of dogs on the car, 14 per cent (but at least we know his tax declaration), which seems to be very small in comparison with Tranpe.
In the past century, the next joint party candidate needed only to achieve a reasonable level of quantifiable improvement.
When my sister was living in the city, we took her to New York Park, which is the largest railway ride operated by the central park administration in New York, and if you don't need a coffee, these three-dollar tickets are the most expensive for you in this city.
Timma's voice is as large as herrings, and the central wall is designed as a bottle of tea, and all small and animal hair is crossed, and the horror and danger are seen as hers, and the music that makes her sound is strange.
The city of too many villages is disappointed: from the perspective of the high walls, the skyline has become too familiar that it cannot provide too much motivation, and the reality of the city has not given rise to a dream.
35 years later, I have not completely forgotten the day when I found this "Swiss House" was actually not a Swiss House, but it was a place in the theme bar "Ye Old Swiss Cottage", which I don't remember, but near a border street in northern London.
However, the rotation of the central park continues to be a magical experience for two 2-year-old children, one 11-year-old child and two 40-year-old girls to participate in activities that each of them enjoys.
If I can evaluate the rotation of the train, I'll be satisfied with it, but I'm glad no one's asked.
But this week, before I print a credit card, I was asked to conduct a five-star assessment of my transaction "test".
In the coffee shop on my street corner, it's the same way. You can also choose 15% of the minimum cost for an evaluation, which is to buy something on the table.
The effect of doing so is not only to reduce the current pace of central transactions but also to bring pressure on service providers to add personal factors to situations that are not necessary.
The poor woman in this hundred store was so sorry for having laughed, and I was tired, and she was awarded five stars by a credit card deal.

Did meat, milk products and chocolate help alleviate infectious disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like your system's dream.
A new study, however, showed that eating foods of meat-containing protein and dairy products could help alleviate the related symptoms of pathogen patients.
Such maladies have a life-threatening effect on about 130 million Americans and some 300,000 British people, resulting in obesity and fatigue, frequent or bleeding, physical and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University usually recommend that patients avoid access to food and milk products to relieve their symptoms, but researchers find that key protein-squarety acids help to promote the growth of immune cells, which can enhance the tolerance of pathogens.
Dr. Marco Colonna explains that the immune cells will patrol the path and ensure that harmful microorganisms that are hidden in food will not penetrate the body.
Balance is maintained between the cells that cause infectious diseases and the cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body and not harming vulnerable organizations of all types.
If the balance is too positive, infectious diseases may occur.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity appeared in a small cell with special bacteria.
To form a cell, the cell needs coloric acid (one of the protein components).
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a group of cells (the normal part of the microbiological cell), and a group of cells that can promote sustainable development.
The number of protein proteins absorbed in food increases, and their immune cells increase.
He suggested that the use of the same methods, i.e. the combination of rheumatic acidic acids and rich in fatty acids, could create a more sustainable and less
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that enhances endurance when she found a group of studies that had such a small cell, but another group did not give birth.
She suspects that this difference is related to the microorganisms of the small white shark (i.e. normally living in the pathogens, viruses and bacteria).
The DNA sequence of the complex cells of the tiny cell reveals that there are 6 genes in the cells with immune cells, but there are no proteins in the cells.
Small whites are fed into non-fertilized environments, so they lack pathogenic microorganisms and cannot produce such immune cells and the presence of pathogens produces immune cells.
To understand how antibiotics affect the immune system, researchers develop a pathogen in the fluid and then transfer unsaturated microorganisms to unaccompanied protein cells.
The immune cell develops into a strong and patient cell.
When the activity is eliminated from the fluid, it can prove that the activity component is a sub-product known as oleoic acid-3-tetrachloride.
The number of these cells increased by approximately 50 per cent after the conversion of the number of colouring acids in small white cells, but the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same cells that promote endurance, and most of us exist on our pathogens.
It is not yet known whether human beings can develop a cell-related genetic defect in patients with pathogens, such as white blood cells in the test.
She said, "The development of these cells may be the result we want to get, because these cells can control the reaction of the immune system.
It can be said that the high level of chlorophyll in the pathogen may lead to an increase in the number of these strains.
José Murinoo thinks Manon signed the "Gene Nemania Matic.

Martic came from Cherry, with an amount of $40,000 in cash, and on Tuesday, the last week of the European summit in Berlin before the Royal Madrey, won the crowns of Paul Boggba and Andreas Perela.
However, during the pre-Brussels Sieia Round, the situation of Maticibis was very poor, and only 45 minutes of time was completed, and Murinio recognized the need for improvement before the start of the British Summer season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom, and a way of thinking -- he's thinking about football," Murinio said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Murinio began his lead at the beginning of this season, and like Matticic, the new contractors, Victor Linderoff and Romelo Lukaku, started the competition at the British Sports Centre.
In an independent report this week, Murinio still wished to introduce again three contracting members, but he insisted that the club "work" was excellent", and in his heart there were four leading contracting members, and the club had introduced three of them.

"If the club could bring in all four members, I'd be happier, but they've done a lot of work for me."
Will China fall if it doesn't build this army?
With the publication of a new defence plan by the United States of America's United States Coast Guard, the UN Coast Guard had become a focus of concern during the night when Japan had identified two new defence defenses in its 2018 budget and had finally brought Japan's DEX defence plan into a material breach, after which the United States had recently released the latest programme of the U.S. FF. Defence Guard Plan, so why would China's new defence defenses have gone away?
As the latest 054A protection shelters were built at the end of 2017, the 054A protection shelters had been built more than 29 highs, and the total number of protective protections had been approaching 053H, and the construction of the first 054A subwater from 2006 to now has been in progress for 12 years, even with the creation of such high-quality protective protections throughout the world, except for China, only the United States of America, during the last seven and 80 years.
And why the construction of so many054A is so simple, that it is useful and useful, in addition to supplementing the many years of sea forces.
054A has been awarded a higher sexual price and good fighting force for years by the Chinese Navy, with a total of approximately 4,000 tons of drinking water, including a 76-mm tank headboat, 32-pound and 8-pound anti-optimal launch systems, 8-pounds 83 and one-H9 helicopters, although the design time is much earlier than ever before, and even today it is not too bad for the entire world to be able to reach the level of protection.
However, this is a well-designed 21st century belt, which is placed on the one hand, and its power system and electronic radar equipment have already existed much more than the current world's main protective belt, as Europe's same type of protection has already been equipped with all electricity, and small multifunctional control of Farreda, in the case of large-scale helicopters, has also been developed.
So it says how China's new protection should develop, which is directly related to its future position and strategic approach to our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy must be entirely a blue-water army, and the future must be a move towards the oceans, with rapid deployment of areas of interest-related concern in China, demonstrating the presence of forces and, where necessary, having the strength to fight to ensure that China's sharp interests in the region are not undermined, so it seems that the new wave of floods will face major diversification and distant development.
In view of the situation in the future chain of China's Navy, the future Chinese Navy should meet in the same way as the United States Navy, with the exception of the necessary nearby coastal guards, other superpowers would form a fleet of combatants or two combatants, as necessary.
The role of the new protection guard in future combatants should be the position of the anti- potential and of the region close to space, and the two attacks should be the protection guard group, which, in accordance with such needs, requires the new protection guard to have strong anti- potential and good medium-sized regional airspace capacities.
On the basis of the above-mentioned position, large-scale projections can be seen as a major example of the protection of future motherhood.
Firstly, there will be a significant increase in the amount of water in relation to the current 054A protection system, which will estimate the amount of new protection water will reach approximately 5,000-6000 tonnes; the power system will use an integrated power forwarding system of QC280 to improve fuel engines and two oil engines; the highest speed is expected to reach about 30 sections, and the highest speed will also increase significantly; with regard to weapons configuration of 76 mm tanks and 1130 nearby defenses, an increase in a 10-inch rocket launch system, followed by a 32-48-pound upgrade and a total of 16-pound launch systems, which should be included in the rear of an 8-16-pneutron launch system, which would also be capable of increasing the range of suspension and storage of two 10-pneutrons; and a four-ply-ray-ray-ray system, which could be used in a four-range range of high-point A.
Such a new level of protection will reach a global standard, even if it is not more than the United States's FFG.
Of course, the concept mentioned above is only the notion of a new type of protection for national property, and it is precisely how we can wait until the new type of protection falls down and let us look forward together.

In recent years, my city has encouraged companies to participate actively in countries, industry standards and regional group standards, to give $300 million to enterprises that are owned or involved in the development of the standards for the production of textile groups, and to promote the participation of companies that are certified through the production of cotton, which is at the highest level in the province and stimulates the enthusiasm of companies to participate in the target.
A day ago, during the production of the Royal Group, the group's head of health and staff were packing a secure door-to-door package for the prevention of theft as a standard for participation in the production of branding groups, ready to be sent to the Quality Test Centre.
Just two days ago, the King had adopted the existing audit of the "Court-making" team of certified experts.
Health indicates that the professional team composed of industrial technology experts and quality certification organizations is highly praised for its achievements in the core of self-innovation, and that it is agreed that the kingdom will become one of the first companies to adopt that standard if the product is tested.
The Royal Group is just a reflection of the standard industrial transformation.
My city, along with its synods, is also a step forward in the work of brands and brands, which builds up groups.
Since last year's establishment of the standards for the manufacture of lead-making teams developed by my city's security portals, many new companies have also been actively applying for targets.

Is China's family debt closer to the United States than it's more terrible to buy houses?
In recent years, what recent changes have been made in the area ' s property policy, and are it not time for the real estate policy to be relaxed?
However, when we are concerned about the prices of property, the macroeconomic constraints, the concerns of the future trends in the real estate market, the " People's Day" reprinted, and the last time we specifically discuss the definition of the "People's Day" comment on the ownership of property, and now the "People's Day" paper is a more serious topic than the purchase of houses, is it even if you buy houses?
Today, we're going to talk about more serious issues than housing: credit.
I. A growing debt crisis in China
In addition to the "People's Day Journal" issue of 17 January, comments were published on the award and the pleasure and pleasure of young people," according to data from the paper, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Society of China, the National Institute for Finance and Development, the National Property Liability Study Centre 's report on the Third quarter of China, noted that the population sector's call rate continued to rise from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017 and that 1.3 per cent in the three quarters in the preceding quarter of 2017 had increased by 3.8 per cent.
The population sector is larger than the debt in the entire entity economy, and the rate of inflation is faster.
The related studies show that the family of China is head of financial institutions with consumer loans, about 2/3 of the population's liabilities, and about twice of the operational loans.
Among them, the average long-term loans for housing loans amount to around 8 per cent, but from an increase in consumption loans, short-term loans are faster and higher than long-term loans.
In addition, the family debt rate of China is only estimated by the family sector as a total of credit received from financial institutions, while the Chinese family also has a number of civil loans, including loans to relatives and large-scale debt.
In view of such data, there is no objection to the fact that, according to statistics from the Susin Financial Institute, only 3 per cent of Chinese population in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, but the population population population rate has begun to grow rapidly since 2008 and has doubled to 36.4 per cent over a short period of six years. By 2017, the population rate has risen to 48.6 per cent.
In addition to one data, last May, the Bank had published a cross-9 countries, which approached the survey of nearly a thousand people.
The visit to this report is aimed at young "Millions of Youth" from 9 countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report noted that 80, 90 per cent of young people living in China had a high rate of 70 per cent, and that the second foreign leader (46 per cent) was also twice the U.S. indicator (35 per cent).
These data inform us of a very likely problem that is more likely to occur than the purchase of houses. The largest possible "grain cow" in the current phase of China's population is still no longer in debt.
Second, why is the housing crisis the most serious issue?
As our analysis has shown, although we have been saying that China's house prices are higher than other countries in the world, does China's housing rate really have a high rate, so it is not going to be able to buy a high price for it, and is it afraid that you will now have to ask a lot of friends about credit?
We look at the world-wide real estate market, and China's real estate market has not yet faced a major real estate crisis, except what we said earlier, but the United States' real estate crisis was the origin of the global financial ocean in 2008 before the decade.
The causes of the U.S. real estate crisis are confined to two rooms: the rooms and the premises.
At the time of the gold age of the United States, the real estate company sold the house at a very low price to a low-income group of people in the United States at the time, and when the United States economy improved, the real estate market was also a source of prestige, but it was not long before the United States economy had stopped its growth and resulted in a fall in the income of the buyer, resulting in a significant drop in household consumption.
However, the situation in the United States was then part of the United States family assets and property assets, and almost all of the United States' low income groups were property assets, while most of the previous 20 per cent high income groups were financial assets, which resulted in a higher debt rate for those who were poorer in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are both houses that were bought in a better time of economic growth, so that the money paid for renting was also calculated by their better income, and when the income appeared to fall, the pressure of the rental was not only reduced by the fact that some of the loan plans became more mobile, so that the issue of the property of these United States households under their chief was thus gradually becoming a crisis of property.
Thus, there was a decline in the price of the property due to the low-paid income, which resulted in the bank starting to recover property, after the bank recovered property from the leased owners, resulting in a very low price decrease in the price of the premises in the region, which resulted in further downsizing the price of the house and creating a poor circle of housing, after falling to a certain extent, more buyers found their house value even lower than their own loans, resulting in more people to stop the repurchasing and more poor accounts.
So a huge evil cycle is formed in this way:
"Economics -- income down -- some people don't pay rent -- banks sell low-cost mortgages -- more people stop borrowing -- banks sell -- and low-cost and low-cost housing --..."
And the problem is not so, because the price of the house is constantly falling, and all of you are not obliged to stop crediting the house to the bank after it has been sold. If the bank is not paying the money you owe it to the bank, then you still need to pay for it, simply assume you're in charge of a set of $600,000, and $240 million at that time. When the price of this house falls to only $2 million, you don't credit the house to the bank. After the sale of the house, you lose not only your $600,000, but also your bank's debt, and you still have to pay it.
Thus, under such a vicious cycle, the United States' economic pace has deteriorated and ultimately led to the financial crisis in the United States in 2008.
Thus, the high level of family debt in China reached 46.8 per cent of the current stage is a very need for caution, which is currently seen as or below the level of developed countries, but the beginning of the issue has begun, and since the beginning of last year, countries have repeatedly stressed the problem of gambling, which is a very clearly predictable decision that if the rate of family debt continues to rise, there will be a great risk of serious financial risk.
Thus, the houses were then used, not to be used, and the countries were more likely to create multimodal supplies, multi-way security, procurement and multi-measures, to further address potential risks.
For our individual families, it must be necessary to give up thinking about the investment of property and to make the best of the time to purchase houses and avoid the overwhelming burdens of their own families, and only reasonable assessment of their income and their level of debt is a healthy family rich development path.

According to a military record published in the "Times" magazine, the White House decided to transfer a military helicopter to South-Westphalia to the Great Treasurer of the U.S. manufacturing industry to $24,000 a month ago.
Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Navy Army Force No. 1 when the President met) was an important demonstration of the project building activities in the United States on 17 July.
President Donald Tranpe, Vice-President Mike Jones and High-level officials from all 50 states have been monitoring the production of products.
The exhibition consists of helicopters made from the state of Quechua, a bridge in Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a train in Mississippi.
On the basis of the record of the team of military helicopters operating on the helicopter (HMX-1), the White Cross military office requested the helicopter to be present by order of day (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south of the "special" activity.
One day before the event, the HMX-1 Commander, in his e-mail to the Air Force Commander ' s Deputy Command, stated " I just want to confirm your knowledge because this activity is of great importance. "
The information indicates that the helicopter will take part in the activities of approximately 7 p.m. on 17 July, at 3 p.m., only after 6 to 9 p.m. on that day.
The information also indicates that one time delay from the White Sea has been delayed and that the return of the ship due to the time limit for work requires a second group of team members.
The original team members are staying at the helicopters during the activities and security forces are staying near the ground.
The " Time " magazine records did not make it clear whether there was an end to the need for group II computers.
The Hague Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record noted that HMX-1 had asked whether this activity had been in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, "One question we ask is whether this is a violation of the Hachi Act, and was informed that there was no violation. "
"It sounds like you're locked up," the Deputy Command replied.
The White House defines this "U.S. production" activity as official activity and therefore is not governed by the "Haki Act".
But even official activities have political colors.
In the event, the President raised the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and a great deal of pressure on the rule of government law.
It's no new thing to use military aircraft No. 1 or Air Force One for political propaganda.

But it's not unusual to use it for the purposes of photography.
Tranunpur was concerned at the slow pace of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida, in February, and finally stopped his background at his first election, while his promotion account was full of complaints about the use of the former President ' s expertise.
The vice-president of the White Paper, Linse Walters, said that "The White House is no longer active because of the 'United States' exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, which were produced by US workers. "
HMX-1 is often trained by aircraft personnel in the vicinity of Washington and South America, and the President of the United States is placed in White House.
In early July, at the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 was trained 58 times in the White House.
One official stated that this United States manufacturing activity was carried out in the training requirements of this month ' s team.
The helicopter forces also flew 11 hours of "non-Presidential support" missions that day.
The White House claims that the taxpayer has not incurred any other means of this activity.
Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the organization's demonstration of South-South helm.
HMX-1 did not retain the budget record of the President ' s flight, so it was very difficult to determine the exact cost of this activity.
However, in accordance with the time spent in the financial year 2017 by the Ministry of Defence, VH-3D can be charged at $24,380 per hour of flight.
The troop records recorded the time each flight from the base of the FARDC, Virginia.
It is claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than that.
Walters stated that "the costs incurred by tax collectors are highly misleading on the basis of the cost of compensation.
These estimates include staff costs, maintenance costs and many others, including unencumbered costs in annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the cost of reimbursement does not include staff costs, but does include oil costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, former White Press Speaker Sean Spike used the helicopter for this activity,
"The idea is to show the United States made this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Conchung are proud of this, and they have all contributed to our national security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of people working on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of a number of Americans who don't give up.
So it's obvious that this is certainly not an inappropriate time."
We do not know whether Taranup is interacting with the helicopter when traveling south on the activities, but he is actually sitting on the edge of the fire truck.
In the White House, Tranpu spoke to Sikorsky's representative, who took his own company plane and the media with him.
He said, "I know Sikorsky.
