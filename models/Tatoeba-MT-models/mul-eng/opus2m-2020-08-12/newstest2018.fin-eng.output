Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, was diagnosed as a mental disorder, and now she's making an art on the subject - "A man should have the right to his own body"
The loss of the project room gallery of the imaging akathemy results in ten patient reports.
Each of them reads Camille Auer's name.
Papers repeat a multi-year story about how foreign people have written up their interpretation of Aures and their identity.
You've decided for her who she is.
"I wanted to tell the person about my medical history so that the violence of the process should be seen," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to sexual harassment.
It is often a long-term period of research involving encounters with psychologists, psychiatrists, caregivers and doctors.
The process is being launched by means of "sex-identification disorder" diagnostic studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
Four years ago, the Auren process began.
Before this, he had used his estrogens online and, of course, had been very long in his own repair process.
He has experienced being a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must be through a rehabilitation process so that sex can also be legalized.
Translaw, i.e. the law transcess over the establishment of a sexual basis (563/2002), obliges transsexual people to be subject to torture in order to obtain, for example, the right sex to be registered in the public register and passport.
At this time, psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of increased reproductive abilities are required for each sex to be corrected.
Man has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is inexhaustible and humiliating human rights," says Auer.
The reform of Translain has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has given eight comments and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary decision which requires the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right of self-determination.
The former Government of Finland has made a change in the law under the direction of Mr Susanne Huossen, Minister for Social and Health.
The election came, and the Basics came to power.
Now there's a change of law again.
This is about internal politics, which are not even linked to this law.
"The Government does not want to raise it on the table, as there are differences within the government about the amendment of the law," said Activist Frank Johansson of the Department of Amnesty of Finland.
The front of the show is two major installations.
The other is the packs and instructions for use of Auer.
For example, at the patient-skeletum installation, any visitor can read about the interpretation of the psychologicals of the Tamperie University Transpolial Hospital.
Psychologists met Camille Auer twice and wrote on this basis a report that should be defined for the treatment of Auer's right and for the benefit of receiving help.
The conscience of the realist seems to be a threat.
The self-examined approach appears to be difficult in a constructive way and the uncertainties related to personality are compounded.
Auer didn't admit these pictures himself.
"It was a shame to hear that I was diagnosed as a man," Auer says.
There was even more reason why Auer was not given sexual therapy.
According to the treatment staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and jumped onto the television show of the transpol waiting area.
Later that television was born in art called the Monument for the Exclusive, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born as a woman can increase his breast, but to remove the breasts requires diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not your own, if you are trying to be different from your sex as defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of the Auer is not the only quality.
The sex segregation process is more difficult for many people than for purely medical operations.
Through it, they meet ten people who must reason on their own status and be entitled to their own sexual orientation.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help don't take care of themselves because they don't have enough of their resources," Auer says.
Many who have applied for processes have back mental symptoms: fatigue, anxiety, possible trial experiences.
The treatment staff of these fluids may determine that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Prevention of care and assistance can lead to even worse human situation than it was before the start of the process," Auer says.
The individual exhibition of the Auer also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had selfish thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what people are usually hard to tell."
The decrease has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it was easier.
He had been able last night to express the feelings that had been in childhood and teen years.
That's why the wide neck didn't feel fit for its own body and why the breast muscles had to be turned around instead of the level of the breast.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people close to him who see him.
It's essential to find out what's going on.
"I have to base myself so much on speaking, dressing, using voice and moving," she says.
Now Auer's trying to see his future. He's a woman.
At the start of the process, however, close-sound comments were likely to cause a lot of damage.
Most of all, it hurts when close friends get involved.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't agree or can't enter it," he continues.
However, not all transmissions do require physical changes.
They do not suffer from physical fatigue, which may cause body or parts of the body to suffer from stress and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and long-term research processes, it cannot be officially confirmed for its own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of the legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
The full-time applicant shall make a written application for a new identity and shall inform the other sex that he or she has experienced.
After a half-year of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall grant the applicant a new identity.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement also covers the exhibition of Auer.
It has not been an art therapy experience for an artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic workshop.
I would like to believe that art is still important and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The National Law Organisation issued a travel notice to Missouri
The National Organisation for National Rights of the Afro-American People's Rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which has resulted in the different practices of the State and the racist attacks.
"The travel information on the NaaCP Mission will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and will invite African tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to take special care when travelling in a country where there have recently been numerous events on the basis of such routes", says the information provided by the Organisation.
The recent law in Missouri made it difficult for the export of separate cases to the right of export. In addition, the implementation of the legislation of the State is relatively minor. According to NAACP, these events lead to the provision of a travel notice.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of the color of their skin and be tortured or killed," NaaCP President Rod Chapel told Kansa City Star.
"We haven't heard of a lot of cases before in a short time."
The travel information on Missouri is the first warning of the United States State.
The series mentioned, for example, the racist comments made against African students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in these circumstances earlier this year.
The travel report also referred to the Ministry of Justice of Missouri's statement that the police would stop 75 per cent of the black carrier more likely than white.
"The purpose of the trip information is to invite people to be on guard and to warn their family, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"For example, people must be prepared by taking money to pay rents or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred of the six countries of the United States were registered in Missouri.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missour Act, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the right to reside and work.
The ACLU Organisation, which guarantees civil rights rights under the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration agents who are obliged to keep the police from immigration.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they concern other countries, but in recent times civil society organizations have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Top: Lint requested from Finnair for additional appropriations from the Director of the Communication
Mika Lintl√§ (center) of the Ministry of Energy, which is responsible for the management of the State, has requested from Finnair, the air carrier, Pekka Vauramo, to receive additional pensions, Yle tells you.
According to the Minister, it is contrary to the will of the State.
The additional EUR 130 000 rose this week when Helsinki spoke of the wage developments of the leaders of the Persian companies.
In February, Vauramo received an additional pension from Kuvalhti in Finland.
Finnair explained that it was granted additional pensions in 2013.
The government has indicated that no additional pensions are used to pay.
The government owns over half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle of ownership decision last year.
The packages were immediately simplified to speak
Another time it seemed that the relationship between the United States and Russia was on the move from cold to warm.
In connection with the G20 conference held in Hampuri, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed to the coming action in the middle of the day.
Later, the feeling has been very cold.
In the last week of the United States Congress and the new economic package signed in the middle of Trump, Russia was strongly reacted.
The most important answer is the second heard by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who says that the tax law signed by Trump means "full-time trade war".
Although Russia's reactions would only seem to be a political retortion and a surplus, it is only after the fall of the conflict between the United States and Russia.
In the United States, it was not easy to cross the border between Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress had indeed adopted a law that was extremely uniform, but it was said to the President that it was much more difficult to accept the law.
The Trump also criticized the young man for signing the law "significantly lacking".
President Trumpi's ambition has been particularly due to Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting its own rights must also be counterproductive.
As is well known, it is important in the United States to examine whether Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections, as well as Russia's relations with the Trump campaign.
The signing between the United States and Russia is true shortly after the quarter.
As the White House staff have changed to the strictness and various scandalous translations have been revealed late in the day, it seems even more clear that it is not a foreign policy under the President of the United States but a president.
This situation is not to be expected in any way.
If Russia's relationship is an earthquake in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to the financial packages, your alarmed security situation in the Union's nuclear field in the Baltic Sea is breaking down.
The EU has apparently taken note of Ukraine's situation in its relations with Russia and has called for the entry into force of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has been once again in its Russia policy as at least half of its top level, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
Like Finland, with Russia, a lot of trade with a Member State, economic packages have been a real waste.
The impact of the US youth package remains unclear.
The EU is afraid that commitments will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project as well as in the Fennovoim nuclear power plant project.
In Europe, diabetes has caused, for example, the absence of vaccines to be left to the economy of the United States of America with an important adverse effect.
The cupcakes are a way of showing hatred in the world's politics.
However, the financial packages must be well thought out and carefully balanced.
On the other hand, it's easier to hurt than to benefit.
Isn't there anything more holy?
At the White House in Trump, there is now in Freepath.
The absence of patients is certainly a sign of change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis died together with American soldiers under the fire of Saddam Hussein in the opening of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top thinkologists of the Trump government, knew well what was going on in his heated argument with CNN channel Jim Acostan. On his release path, Miller's attack had to be addressed in a sentence which, in connection with the president's proposal, would significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really think about his own disease.
If he had done so, he would have gained great wealth from the organizers of the cruises and from the Free Path.
His attack was of little significance and particularly that in 1903 his foot was added to Emma Lazarus‚Äôs ashes ‚Äì 17 years after he was prepared.
So Miller said to Acosta: "I don't want to go to it more precisely in history now, but in the Freedompath there's... a symbol of a bright American freedom all over the world.
Runo was later added, and it is not part of the original Free Path."
Miller wasn't wrong, but it's not just history, as he said.
The essential are the words concerning Lazarus, the only quality in which the state calls not only migrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your skinned mass yearning to breakfast free, / The written refusal of your teaming noise."
Runo is now more timely than ever.
Miller never practiced literary criticism, and he made it clear that "the poor of the world" are not welcome to the U.S.
The importance of the various freedoms is part of the wider political and cultural importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus‚Äôs friends campaigned for the purpose of arresting the corpse under his feet. They knew well that it was very political.
The latter was intended to demonstrate the relationship between the French and American equality in a classic comparison, with the woman‚Äôs physical independence.
Lazarus changed its importance: his speech is no longer abstract, but it has my voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the wounded.
The idea of joining the race was a massive feminist coup d'√©tat and a devastating attack on the American nation.
Lazarus has changed little meaning, and justice has long wanted to change it back to its original origin.
Rush Limbaugh ‚Äì a leader who can now be seen as some kind of preview from Trump ‚Äì said in 2010 that the Freepath is not inviting anyone, but it is an early front-liner for the new conservatives who takes the United States' call to hide the darkness into the world: "Lady Liberty stands in front of us.
He's taking the call for freedom from the United States to another world.
The call doesn't show the way to the United States."
Of course, Limbach was partly right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the vision.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hoped that the immigrants would be on board after a long and difficult journey.
He saw it as a protection and a better way to live than people looking for it.
His gift of freedom comforts us by giving us hope and by giving us hope for the well-being of others.
And Miller and Trump don't want it in any case.
Their call doesn't seem to show the way, but he reads hate gossip, their only source of power.
MM Competitions 2017: Neil Black exceeds the Scottish members of the British Ison
Yesterday, Doyle remembers the time when only two shots arrived in the Ison-British countryside.
The result of the Ison-British General Security Council, Neil Black, says that 16 Scottish members of the group participating in the World Championships are "significant strengthening".
On Friday in London, the number of Scottish athletes in the MM competitions started has been selected.
Black says in Scotland, "there's something special going on," which is to be learned by the General Assembly of the United Kingdom.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for as long as we understand what the issue is," Black says.
"I discussed with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scotland General Security Council again believes that it is associated with the operation of the Union,
And the British General Security Council believes that it is behind it that they are doing their work.
And the usual loser thinks he has to have something to do with it.
However, there is something very powerful about it then."
Many football players compete in London for real medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah during the course of the course of 5,000 metres.
"The winter is the summer of waatithon.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The mourners withdrew from the opportunity for high achievement and strong motivation, regardless of where they are going to live and practice.
In the words of the prophet Isaiah, there was a real sense of identity and a deep sense of humor."
In the evening, Doyle is hopefully 400 metres away from the UN Master Races, and these are his fifth World Championships, which he believes is "unsurprising" that there are 16 shots in the field.
The previous forecast was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, the middle passenger racer, has been running for five years in the United Kingdom and two of Europe's predictions.
He competes in London for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London. He also supports him with his eyes: a man has a very great career that belongs to the winnings of the Ison-British MM casinos and the annual Games competition.
Doyle remembers his first world championship contest, when the only shot in the field was Lee McConnell.
The commander of the Major Party says he is "the most powerful" because there are so many shots with which he competes in real final places and medals.
"To the captain, however, it is a great honor, but even more so because members of the community vote in the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the students who have gone to the rural area.
It shows how long we've been here.
They're also accused of being athletes competing for rewards.
Captain, did I speak?
I think it went very well.
I focused on how happy we are when we have homework.
It is important to enjoy the support of domestic law and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that there will be an unexpected miracle from the atmosphere."
Preventing public officials from using Facebook: Do not impose conditions on public authorities if you are not critical
Our father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but they soon began to appreciate him for all possible domestic politics, always according to his political principles.
Criticism must have happened.
But he didn't delay his fellows.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we can be led into stupid and silent as a lamp to the roof," said Washington in 1783.
That's what we're going to do to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn about Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and stopped their representatives.
The United States Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's right this week.
His personality is considered unfounded, and his relationship with the Internet was also impaired.
"What's the matter? This is just Facebook," many comments.
But it's important,
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the recommended republican governor of the state of the state of democracy.
He's got the best estimate of his activity in the 50 governors.
Hogan isn't highly responsive to heat.
He has led the State firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also partially used Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and published it in the photo of the cancer treatment.
Therefore, preventing users from coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum that maintains his staff by tax havens.
Hogan's informant Amelia Chase defended the government's role in the challenge to Washington Post.
However, it is too easy to find out how to make comments into trolleys, puzzles, or haters.
Washington Post challenged users who stopped using Hogan's Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their leaders, and they were not trolleys but teachers, businessmen and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, observant and relevant.
The pastor hired you in his comment book; he wanted to bring Hogan to the Catholic faith.
The prosecutor, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland Bowie, was not hostile but asked the question of fraud.
"I am disappointed at my comment on the fact that Hogan has not taken a stand for the wrongs and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post newspaper.
"And I cannot accept that when more and more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered as organized groups and become a large group of concerned citizens."
The Governor's staff called comments "an attack". Another might call them to promote the most important things.
On Facebook, it is easy to control your message by stopping a reader or deleting a critical comment.
Before old age, it should have been necessary to send the staff to collect and burn dictionaries containing critical signatures, or to hold and delay interested parties.
It is true, however, that this is the same issue, now just digitally.
Hogan is not the first official of the public who has been charged with breaking up the social media channels on Facebook and other media.
President Trump's blockade Twitter users have challenged him to the right.
The first important decision on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
According to Justice James C. Cacherik of Alexandria, the Government of the border of Loudoun violated the first addition to the United States Constitution by preventing the voter's Facebook.
And the United States Association of Civil Rights went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with President Matt Bevin of the Republic of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington, previous mail payments had the same effect as today on the Internet.
The number of pamphlets increased from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers persecuted Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius were written in a dictionary in which they appealed to Washington‚Äôs decisions.
The President's office received invitations to the conference, which was assessed on the Jaye Agreement, the United States and the British Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which was published on the collection of documents from the paper of George Washington network project.
However, he did not delay his supporters.
Freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of speech are fundamental to our society.
The real leadership means the adoption of this fact.
Birds' ice cream must be stopped immediately
The samples have come from about a quarter of the places, and in addition net notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and western Finland, but then also from the private Haapa River and from the Wall, Specialist Marja Isimorsu Evira tells us.
The viherpes have died in a miracle called Tricomoneosis.
It causes the scientific name Trichomonas to be found in the beginning of the galaxy.
It has previously been known to the old communities, and especially to the forest.
In the year 2000, however, the disease was also diagnosed with headaches.
In 2009, it was right.
Then Tricomonosis caused an acute breakdown in Finland‚Äôs spinal cord, which followed by the species‚Äôs endurance.
Diseases have now been on the rise, but not yet in a large measure, the museum's natural science centre (Lumes) of the University of Helsinki is told by the museum director Juha Honkala.
It's scary that the previous epidemic of vegetarians will be renewed, something to do.
What must be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by anyone: stop the bird‚Äôs feeding immediately.
More about it later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the housework Renaissance Club
Former European co-player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from his homelife for the next three days when Renaissance Club is held in East London at 25.
Northern Ireland Rafferty led the tournament organized by Archerfield Links in the last year before the last round but finally disappeared to Paul Eales. Rafferty has been interested in the new location and works for the club's founder and delivery director Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will lead to its complete delight," says Rafferty.
"The players see the field best. It's great.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an incentive for the game, and he's high on his time here.
The tournament is a great opportunity for this field."
The English Eales defends the mystery for the first time, even though they have won their 32-year-olds in the streets of Europe, as well as in the European Road and the European Roadmap.
"This feels really special," says a player in Southport.
"I am not allowed to defend my victory of Extremadura Open, because the tournament is not part of this year's race.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament was a great story for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr will return to reality on his own land.
This is his first performance in Scotland then in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing at home is always the most important thing," Orr, who lives in Helsinki, says.
"You want to be successful, but you also feel excessive stress.
I've had fun playing again, and I've played hard.
I'm satisfied with my game until now."
The third will be followed in the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournamenters Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
There are six shots in the tournament: Orr and my former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car stop pays five pounds if there is only a driver and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.

There were possible internal problems with cash
In the case of a post office in the port of Pori, there are no other internal problems found in the case of the gas station, and the case was reported to have been reported as Torstana.
Internal investigations will continue.
The explanations began when a man who had stopped his health care service thought that his health had weakened because of the bad environment in which he was involved.
According to the president of the Poron, the superintendent Mika Holman said that no problems have been encountered in the health situation of other men.
It turned out that there was a private situation, and other servants there had no health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to find a basic explanation on this matter.
At this point there is no idea that we would have any internal problems, Holma says.
In my opinion, it is said that, as a result of the arrival of July, cashiers have had to transfer goods, which has led to a temporary increase in inflation.
Without it it could have made it look boring, Holma's real.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold
Bardina Degei doesn't use her food device.
I mean, he's only used rarely.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enorotal, the capital of the Pananian region, located in the stateless province of Papua in Indonesia. When he prepares for dinner, he usually puts a batatin ‚Äì locally "nota" ‚Äì right next door.
After about half an hour, they returned to their car to eat their potatoes with a little light, without washing their hands.
There are no rooms in Degein's home. She sits on another land where she usually also handles her daily baggage, such as the nearby breast-feeding pool in the same water.
By using the office, you'll be able to deliver an envelope in the open room.
Degei is a young man's fourth wife, and he has not been appointed to care for his fears.
There's plenty of crime around here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the men are unemployed, and many have plenty to eat. In addition, the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one's gonna believe walking around the corner after five o'clock," Degei says.
This is a rare curvature on the shoulders of the ship of Papua, in the former Netherlands, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The addition of a controversial national vote, in which 1,026 winter prices were required to vote publicly in front of the group.
The Dutch authorities opposed local autonomy quickly turned their anger on Jakarta's government, which has a strong hold on its administration and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights activists from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The enerrotal is special and three. The trip begins in half an hour by flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura Nabire and continues to take a five-hour walk in the car park.
There's no public transport here.
About 19,000 people live in the city are surrounded by forests of bamboo trees, whose subtropical trees have been turned into clocks.
Only a few Indonesians have come here, regardless of the suppliers and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian apostles, the household of Pope Mee Pago worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have occurred.
"We didn't have any such clothes," Degei says. He means color, hand-cuffed, black-headed, and yellow-colored.
"Before we had only paper as our covert cover."
The pope is an Indonesian province of poverty. 28 percent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold.
Panai is designed for a total area of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world‚Äôs largest and most productive gold mine. It owns Freeport McMoran company, located in Phoenix, U.S.A.
In 2015, Freeport produced $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua New Guinea has an estimated 78 billion dollars of timber resources.
However, these wealths bring harm to the papal people because they mean the destructive approach of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military units in 1998-2004.
The pope's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are punished with love.
According to human rights activists, after 1969 the Indonesian army killed more than 500,000 priests and wounded, tortured, and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Commission on Human Rights on the subject, in the 1970 ‚Äô s, the populace in the Pope‚Äôs overcrowding of the worlds had a mass murder rate.
In the last year, the Indonesian police held more than 3,900 people in peace talks.
The report of the British Architect of We Will Lose Everything since 2016 contains reports of previous year's advertising, such as unlawful activities, torture ‚Äì poverty and electronics are particularly recommended ways ‚Äì and undisputed attacks on peaceful opinions.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the cases are weekly," says Andreas Harrisono, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
The ruins have been carved when the natural resources of Papuan people attract changers from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but the population structure is changing when the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi from Indonesia turn Muslims to the region in the hope of a better income.
Swimming warning food stores sell exposed cana and gado-gado poisoning in the groundnut box.
The locals are hard to compete.
"Motors have started selling cana and hate at a lower rate than local ones," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is home to Pania and moved to the province's capital after work.
"The local women lost their client."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo ‚Äì his favorite Jokowi ‚Äì promised in 2014 the pope's lack of justice and human rights violations.
The pope is composed of 29 regions, and this former stepfather has won a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on his journey to the city of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed in Papua New Guinea, and the locals feel disappointed when they come.
"Our hearts were touched by our vote in 2014 and we hoped that he would fulfill our hopes and restore justice," you say.
The panic was just two months after Jacob‚Äôs final officials.
One of the children was singing Christmas at Enorotal 7.12.2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycling.
Feared children told soldiers that they should use airplanes.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the Witnesses, the soldiers who were beaten arrested the children and treated them badly.
So one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16 - year - old Yulianus Yeimo, was able to cope with the consequences of an accident.
A couple of hours later, the building of the state electoral board, which was located near the scene, was set on fire, and the next day it started.
About a thousand pilgrims ‚Äî young men, women, and children ‚Äî gathered at the foot-and-mouth disease station to demand the right of the local police and military centre.
They were accompanied by forest trips to the festivals, and they started to present the traditional dance dances of the Papuan Mee Pago world, where they dance around and follow the flight song.
Some of the fans started building police and military buildings.
When I felt hot, soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: "If the human forces make more than three times against them, shoot them as dead." The information is based on the TIME paper to see an official document that has not been published to local media.
Jeremias Kayama, 56, head of Kego Koto district, helped with the situation and asked the force to rest and return to their homes.
No one wanted to hear it anymore.
"When I turned around, I was thrown to the left coast," he told the TIME paper by washing his groundless scarf.
We still don't know who shot him, but we're gonna get rid of the soldiers' borders.
"In my opinion, several doors were fired."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times.
"I ran into his arm and made sure it was really him," said John TIME. In many Indonesian ways he uses only one name.
"So that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Pope's police inspector Yotje Mende told the suppliers that the police only "protected" the police station because it was the target of an attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistyo, a police officer of the Pope.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young entertainers were killed and many were injured.
The next day Jakarta reported her death.
Three weeks later, in Jakowi, he had a voice in Jayapura, where he expressed his concern with the families of the victims and promised that the pope‚Äôs violence would be dealt with.
"I want the case to be examined immediately so that it will never happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch the findings of human rights violations outside the legal system.
But she started to get off her tree right away.
"Most of the crimes took place a long time ago,
At the beginning of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000s.
Most importantly, we have decided to investigate infringements, but we need certain processes," he said.
In his interview with the TIME page at Jakarta on 5.6.2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he didn't intend to start his findings with Papualla.
"All will be found in justice," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crime against humanity". More than a thousand crimes related to the death of a person in East Timor in a suicide vote in 1999. Wiranto told the TIME paper that the Pope's violations of human rights have already been resolved in 11 cases, as well as in Pania.
The families of the victims were falsely accused.
"I have been challenged four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," John says.
"I've been tired of this."
She's still telling her life about fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," she says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panickers do not believe in discussing the event.
He says that the soldiers had tortured him when he was helping to kill four of his victims.
"The soldiers were looking for me after the victims were buried," he says.
The shootings aren't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the Western Panyas in the vicinity of Deia.
One died and 17 was injured in a misunderstanding between the director of the brick company and the construction company, who got its start when the director refused to take his body away from the lost man in the hospital. The group of victims also had children.
The man in need of hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who had been caught in the water while fishing near the river. He died on his way to the hospital.
The angry Greeks showed their opinion in the construction area in front of the company.
According to the police, the Western police arrested police who were responding to the warning charges.
According to the locals, however, the police movement of the Indonesian semi-military police opened up to a mob where one of the West was killed.
"We're in danger, we're afraid of losing," says 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw victims brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding home for two days."
The Deiain Parliament has called for the removal of the police from responsibility and the removal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Panai has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development leads to dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal households living in the middle of the Pope's power.
Many have joined the Pope‚Äôs Liberation Movement (OPM), the Capinal Army, which claims to defend the rights of the pope by the tragic attacks and the kidnappings of the Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and arresting thousands of people in Pania for "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the prisoners will never come back.
In the center of the papal population, Panai is known as "a serious, forgotten place".
Poverty is a food of dissatisfaction.
There are only a few rice to be sold in Enorotal and this is too expensive for locals,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
People grow their own food: mainly potatoes and some similar fruits and leaves.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five battalions.
Most of the hundreds are for the family, and the ends are sold in a dormitory.
Ten battalions pay only 10,000 rubies (75 cents).
In time, differences in the performance of local and variables have increased, and the number of variables has increased since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to locals better trained and older immigrants.
Only a few people have sufficient capital and expertise to drive their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay here because there's no work or money," said Pania's President of the Council of Home Affairs John Gobai.
Sir Pappa's gonna stay in the world for a little bit of attention.
In addition, restrictions on international innovation are still severe.
Earlier this year, French suppliers Franck Escudie and Basi were charged with the Pope, although they had received a rare description. For a formal reason, there was a lack of capacity to work with local institutions.
According to Human Rights Watch Asia‚Äôs Deputy Director, Phelim Kinen, Jokowi has not had his election opportunities. He has not increased transparency and has not contributed to development by removing restrictions on innovation.
"Indonesia's undisclosed eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: the introduction of visas and the black list," China stated in its opinion.
The lack of freedom of movement of the press means that the government of Indonesia is only stressing the approach of the Pope.
In March six of the Member States of the Pacific ‚Äì Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshallese and Solomon Islands ‚Äì invited the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "calculous and widespread violations of the Pope", including the outbreak of the Panya.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Pope's liberation movement.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rapporteur Arrmanatha Nasir, denounced the charges and told the suppliers in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of press, so it would be difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights violations".
Local authorities want foreign governments to be missing.
When Kees Van Baarin, the head of the Dutch official government, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, locals broke down the silence and expressed their desire to be free, he told us that he was not interested in meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections 2019, but the popes say they are not likely to vote in Jokowi anymore.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have come to Spain for the shooting," said the President of the Council of Home Affairs Gobai.
He wants to know about the plight of the oppressed: they live under a weak and unimaginably military rule in the absence of poverty, in practice or health services and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the panickers, like the others of the popes, hold the voice they give to Jokow, "the big one," which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," she says.
Despite threats and threats, the owners of the Pana's shooting situation once again demonstrated their resistance in comparison: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country by the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at the same time they don't let responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in his head.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora laments Robert Heleneu's recast: "Even their fans don't want to see"
Robert Heleneus and Dereck Chisoran of the heavy series were intended to take on 27 May in the Hartwall arena.
However, the withdrawal was withdrawn for commercial reasons.
Chisora will complete the launch of the new production in the IML TV challenge in the young Heleneu maps.
My study in Finland took place in Finland, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell lipsticks there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him taken because he's sick, Chisora is upset.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in full in the Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the prize with a contestant score.
The re-production of lipid was slowed down, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told the evening Sanomi in May that the takeover had been transferred to a syxyx.
There's nothing new about the procedure.
However, the withdrawal is no longer difficult for Chisoora.
It was likely that the withdrawal should have been cancelled in any case by Chisora.
In Torsta, three days before the take-off, I woke up on the hottest cliffs.
My sister was about to explode.
I was told at the hospital that I had to stop, Chisora tells me.
Brittany says she's at this point in about 45 percent good.
He's not interested in all of this. He's not interested in the new treatment with Helenius, but at the time, there's Dillian White.
Chisora suffered from White's death in December.
You came to return your power to the Tower Bridge in Dubai.
The villages had the highest number of buildings in the world in Dubai. Hundreds of residents had to flee 337 meters from the highest 79-terrestrial building.
This was already a second fire game within two years of the building known as Torch, called.
The building was demolished, and no one knows that it was destroyed.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the alarm and the voices of the people.
We would run the doors down the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George's apartment told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the landing teams were allowed to arrive at four in the morning at local time and remained freezing from the building.
The government announced that it would arrange its accommodation for those who left their homes.
The event can again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer areas of high buildings across the world.
The Torch Building Board conducted a post-fire study in 2015, in which it found that the most harmful were the public debt and discrimination.
In the United Kingdom, the police believe that the Lonton Greenfell Tower was able to promote rapid progress in the fire which killed 80 people in June.
A small parking lot was stolen during the night of the mopo
A small parking lot was stolen from the property at approximately 21 hours and between 5 a.m. and 5 a.m.
Mopo disappeared from Niinbar's address on Tikamentie 2.
Mopo was on his mark Sky Team Monkey.
Well, it's red, and registration is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.
The police are asking for information about your mobile phone or your e-mail address. This email address is being protected from spambots.

Amended 3.8.2017 at 12.40: The police reported that the mopo has been found.
In the United States, more than 20 per cent of air passengers take prohibited items according to their equipment, reveal the questionnaire.
A survey conducted by passengers reveals that more than 20 per cent of passengers in the United States had imported prohibited items knowingly or unwittingly from the United States Transport Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least six per cent of passengers had stolen or otherwise equipped items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they were able to find out after knowing that they had been in the wrong place to carry weapons, bombs or explosives.
The question was answered by over a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also show that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
The rules of the TSA, of course, were 19.7 per cent of the offenders, representing the Y sex pool and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X gender pool.
Most of the rules were violated by foreign food and pregnancy on the plane.
More than three per cent of the imports were reported to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2 per cent of the women and 3.7 per cent of the men reported the substances banned from their imports to the aircraft.
This question was shared by passengers from various parts of the United States. The company carried out it wanted to find out how many of the goods had been imported into the accident and how many had done so well.
It is not surprising that the most traveling passengers also bring the goods of transport to the end of the security investigation ‚Äì whether known or not.
But as the company has done the question, the instructions of the TSA are very complex and amazing.
Travelers often don't know what to take to the plane and how much to take.
It is not surprising, then, that most of the TSA's backups are pregnant.
For a while, there was also a feeling that the plane could not carry books.
Fighters are allowed to take home flights but not international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, followed his decision to delay Obaman's decision to reduce emissions
On the day that 15 States had challenged the right of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, President Scott Pruitt of the EPA, Pruitt launched his first decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions caused by Obaman‚Äôs traffic.
The amendment showed that its management office would take better account of the needs of decision-makers in relation to the environment of the Member States.
Pruitt did not mention in his statement the claim that he had been brought before the Court of Justice of the United States against his previous decision.
The Member States should begin to comply with the country‚Äôs Ozone requirement from 1.10.2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the decision-making process one year ahead so that his office would have more time to start planning because the office "does not want to miss local decision-making or harm economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA.
After its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against industrial sectors using chemicals and fossil fuels.
The immediate change of opinion on Wednesday is the latest return to Pruitt's plan to extend the rules.
The Federal Court of Justice in Washington, D.C., issued a decision by the Head of the EPA in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obaman Government decision on oil and gas companies.
In its opinion on Wednesday, Pruitt stated that his complete regulation only strengthens cooperation with the EPA in a multi-stage process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"The EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines during previous administrations and has waited for activists and others to challenge the right to be granted from the time of the contract," Pruitt said. He challenged the environmental authority's right over ten times in his previous work.
"We do not believe in the regulation by means of legal proceedings and we are serious about the deadlines.
We also have a serious view of the regulation on our activities and of the financial powers of Finland."
However, the EPA's opinion found that Pruitt could still use "the powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the rules "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are going to be more involved in the conventions than in the change in the laws of the oceans.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in Senate.
This week the EPA‚Äôs general prosecutor-in-chief in New York, Eric Schneiderman, led to the challenge of bringing States together, said that the group was going to continue the pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind is a significant victory for 6.7 million New Yorkese and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected in their community," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, they included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Colombia.
Earth's ozone, for example, results from emissions of cars, power stations, oil stations and chemicals in the atmosphere.
The resulting fertilization can cause serious respiratory problems to reborn groups, and it is also a part of the thousands of deaths that have occurred in the past year.
People's health promoters and environmentalists were delighted with the amazing change in the direction of Pruitt.
"I am concerned about how much stress was required to make the friend responsible for our breathing test use a good reason," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must also fight against Trumpi's rule, because its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of the polluters and other groups of time forwards."
From the manufacturer of super-cars coming up the roof door - "It happens to Ferrari's style"
It is also intended to contribute to hybrid motor vehicles as well as when it tries to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it's happening in Ferrari's style, the supplier's director Sergio Marchionne said about planning in the media sector on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy are revealed in the first year when the Italian manufacturer of supercars introduced his new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All cases of East-Savu virus outbreaks of the same type of virus
The coastal cyclone infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East-Savu, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the health and well-being plant has ensured that the fifth outbreak of East-Savon is the same as the following infections.
THL has ensured that by January 28 July, an infected person with breast cancer is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East-Savu.
On the basis of this information, all the concerns identified in East Savos are related to the first outbreak in the region identified in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not had any other types of anticancer virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur after the fifth of the patient‚Äôs illness between half a year and that the epidemic is not over, says Dr. Mirkalena Erkil√§, who is responsible for the symptoms of Soster‚Äôs primary health care.
New outbreaks of tuberculosis or their doubts have not been revealed after the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is important above all that everyone take care of their own immune system, reminds Erkki.
More on: There were three new drug trafficking in the country - "Additional concerns or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a voluntary event
The quota of the item was not even considered to be legislatable.
It is based on the fact that the process is producing a five-sided metal that is toxic.
It is legal to make a living at home in the first year, but not even considering the legislating of the pontika kitchen.
I'm going to make it into a walkout. I'm gonna make it back with a little more.
As a result of the regulation of the acidity, the process is based on the production of wine including methyl methaline, which is toxic.
There has been no political desire to set up a pontifical quota as a right for any person, the Government Council of Ismo Judge of the Ministry of Social and Health.
When the Ministry prepared an alcohol reform, the title of the bridge was not considered to be legislatable.
It is also not a matter of political intervention.
There was no debate on the release of the Muslims, the representative of the People's Republic of Outi M√§kel√§ (c.e.).
He is a negotiating body of representatives of the Government, which has taken the lead in the reform of alcohol.
Allowing a point to be entered at home may not continue to grant an application.
Commercial production also remains promising.
The judgment states that there must be a simple rule for the domestic production of alcoholic beverages: alcohol must be prepared at home for use.
This means that in addition to wine, beer, and wine can now be made lawfully at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements from the bedrooms and furnishings and enables the preparation of the kitchen, M√§kel√§ to correct.
The preparation must also be carried out in such a way that raw materials or flavourings produced in contact with them are clearly detectable in the mouth.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared for themselves as much as you want, and personal alcoholic beverages can be given as gifts.
It can't be sold yet.
There is no longer a public health problem in Finland, the Court of Justice believes.
A much larger change took place in 2004 when the passenger exports from Belarus and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Viro.
The alcohol issue is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol law comes to the public's attention as soon as your cause begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the delegation's already taken the position, M√§kele's happy.
Oscar Pistorius was hailed as being sent to the hospital by armed guards
The pain suffered by Oscar Pistorius was attributed to the South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffered imprisonment in Atterideville prison.
According to the British Mirror paper, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital by the guards who had been armed this morning.
Pistorius suffered from injuries, but he got out of the hospital last night.
The prisoner's informant confirmed that Pistorius was sent to the hospital for research.
On behalf of the family of the Pistorium, the informant said that the former top-up singer was okay.
In the last summer‚Äôs Supreme Court ruled for six years as a six-year paralympic cultamist, his girlfriend, Reeva Steinkamp, was sentenced to six years in prison.
Pistorius shot Steinkamp in February 2013.
Literary telephone discussions reveal the emphasis of Trump on the construction of Mexico‚Äôs border
United States President Donald Trump and the President of Mexico and Australia have written letters to Washington Post.
Trump invited President Enrique Pe√±a Nietoa to close his public speech on 27 January 2017 in a telephone debate that he was not going to pay the proposed limit.
In the United States, President Nieto quoted Nieto as telling us that this had been publicized on the wall project. "You can't say so to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched its presidential campaign by allowing the U.S. border to be built at the cost of Mexico.
The Washington Post also announced the first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on his first call to the trumpet.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on a trip to Australia would be "serious", "serious" and "default". According to the trumpet, the agreement concluded by Obama would make him look "impossible" because he had proposed the refusal of refugees to reside in the United States.
Trump stopped calling Turnbull by saying that this was "the most unpleasant call all day".
Georgia's blood count: The activists re-examined the hope of a racist strike
Ford Mercuriy's brand car ends up in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Forum.
The car has four black passengers and a white carrier. Four armed men supported the road before the car hit it.
The leader of the group, a middle - aged middle - aged man dressed in a wheelchair, takes a deep breath and runs through the wind.
Travelers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man whispers.
"Olus autosta!"
The voices break the silence when a young black man is driven out of the window.
This tragic event is only a resurgence presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the consequences of the follow-up are true when the horticulture is planted on the "Roger" corner.
The human rights organizations have since 2005 returned Moore's Forum to commemorate the events of 1946. Then Ku Klux Klan launched two black parishes, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It's amazing that no one has been detained during these years - although the killers live in our midst and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the reconnaissance system.
"It's a shame of history, but above all it's a burden that weighs on our soul."
Brooks is 71 years of age active civil rights activist and former Congressman of Georgia.
He has to be called upon to act immediately, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that the error has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to have a right, we want the matter to be decided in the end, and we want to step up and do the right thing, but first of all we want the right," Brooks says.
"We can't go ahead and make a deal before we get the right."
In Georgia's blood count, the killer hid the victim's body on 27.7.1966.
According to the FBI documents received by the NBC, more than 50 men were suspected of being kidnapped from Monroe and its surrounding community.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists believe that the reasons for the lockdown have been in local knowledge for the entire period: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia had the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held there.
According to the FBI, the election time was marked by an event in which black tenant Roger Malcom disappeared from white farmer Barnett Hester, who was apparently referring to Malcolm's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was shocked that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI, an influential white farmer, Roy Harrison, paid $600 for Malcolm's debts against which he was released from prison.
At home Malcom and Dorothy were following their priests Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The team stopped their car before Moore's Ford went off.
"He revealed that Harrison stood and ordered the murders," says the FBI's report.
"He also revealed that there was a secret link between the State and local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murder and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is making things worse.
"It was a voter," she says.
"They were killed because they wanted to tell the blacks that they'd do the same if they wanted to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been leading Georgia's blood transfusion response for nearly ten years.
The presentation is extremely realistic and prisonable. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe in today's lost United States.
It is difficult to see the presentation, but it is even more difficult to see what Greene believes is meant.
"We don't want to talk about cheating because we should face our own dark side," says the manager.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or want to hear what I've had to experience."
On the first day of this year's presentation began in June. On the first day, about 30 exhibitors ‚Äì ten black and ten white ‚Äì gathered to listen to Green's routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as Greene's assistant director.
He has been presenting in the reconnaissance of the local head of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always one difficult and counterproductive.
"It's gonna be a mess because I'm not my own," Marbough says.
"It is important, however, that history be preserved on this side so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The presentation starts with a meeting where Malcom calls and calls on Hester, and he's worried that Hester's had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear?
Rascona or Hester wide.
Then it'll be fine.
And then all (at least all the black actors) are laughing.
Greene's making it harder.
"What?" Rascona asked.
He's crazy.
"Did I hurt too much?" he asked.
"No," Greene's getting bored.
"I don't think the whites used the word n--u at that time."
"Yes," another black-eyed actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation must be ignored, but the room has power over your friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to respect the memory of those who have won their death.
The trial begins.
Now Rascona's words are civil.
No one's laughing.
The reconnaissance will end quickly and violently.
Voice, lips ‚Äì and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is in every other word.
Within a few ten meters, 50 viewers are looking at their faces with their eyes wide open and with their eyes wide open.
In general, almost half of the population are black and half white.
There is a parish group that has come to see the presentation from the state of Ithaca in New York, but most are local.
They've gone to Brooks' funeral at the funeral of the victims in the Georgian concentration camp.
The horrors have turned out to be true. The tunnel at the scene is hard.
After the song, Greene calls the force team to check out the bodies.
Children are eager to look at bodies that are covered and unmoveable and that are washed for others.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutates to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene will thank the public.
The exhibitors presented by the pollutants shall reflect their references and shall apply to the polls.
Bradshaw welcomes Marbaughia, local head of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona wants two exhibitors and then relax after the show.
"It's okay," the presentation included a woman who was comforting.
"We know it's not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the speakers will meet for the evening.
The white parishioner who has reached the altar is eagerly discussing the presentation with the black parish.
Denise Duplinskin finds it hard to find words when he describes the exciting feelings of the presentation.
"It's hard to hear the words of the calami and see the strange things that say and do people who look just like you ‚Äì just because they look just like you," he says.
"I've been told that there's still going on," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other hand, Brooks, on the other hand, remembers the development of civil rights at the same table for the audience.
He'll tell you what he's been doing before the year's presentation.
"Response is a powerful experience, as it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also a educational experience," Brooks says.
"It's a message that this can happen again if we don't take it from our students.
Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Reliance on growth in trade will disappear: removing "independable parts" of this line will really save
Is it allowed to break off the paper of the coke before it's finished?
But what if you take your mom out of your head in the middle of the night... and it's going to weigh as much as you can?
The responses are strongly shared: for one, it is an indication of extreme farming, and for the other, they do not want to pay any hate for parts that they do not use and which, however, go home to roskey.
Yes, the weather is known in the shops.
For example, in Helsinki Ruohohal√§den K-City Market, the angry party is located in brothels, since many people, for example, have gone out of the paper.
The paper from the factory is taken to the biowaste of the trade.
According to the news published by the economy, slavery in hate is surprising to trade.
But how much of the excess of anger before it is finished will actually save money?
How important is this?
We're testing women how the price changes when they take newspapers or take away from their mothers, their latrines, their brains, their porcelains, and their petals.
Cotton: EUR 2.10 for the value of the cod, the price was EUR 1.80 when all the paper was removed.
Ananas: The total price of an Annana paid went up to EUR 1,95 when I took it off.
Latva-Artist: EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short position was removed.
The interest rate: Two interest rates totalled 75 cents.
It's 60 cents off.
Parsal: The average parsal paid EUR 1 and without charge of 80 cents.
End result: If newspapers and posters start to go out, save at least a few cents of one hate.
The price of the hate reported as a percentage decreased by up to 20 per cent.
The total amount of these purchases would therefore have been EUR 1,20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a five-year contract with the PSG
Brazilian statesman Neymar is a five-year-old French football match with the PSG, says the news agency AFP.
In the past Thursday evening, Neymar's representatives were told that they had paid the football for FC 222 million in Barcelona, which played over Spain.
The most recent EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
A previous forecast was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
Spain was too late to move in the past tortoise when it rejected Neymar's first tax company.
According to the rules of the Board of Governors, it is not possible to pay the principal price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy his own contract out of it, which happens by turning over the money.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and its representatives who delivered money too much to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to have reached Paris in the spring.
They shall be submitted as soon as possible to the new home Member of the PSG in the opening against Amiens on Monday.
Uefa studies details
In addition, Barcelona provided information on the tax on Uefa European Football Union in order to determine the possible effects of fraud on the case.
Among other things, the Spanish president, Javier Tebas, has questioned the rules of the Uefan game on the misuse of the PSG's funds.
Uefa can be punished by a penalty of more than EUR 30 million for three years.
According to Uefan, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic stability.
The transfer of Neymar to the PSG affects the economy for several years, but the effect cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG can sell several players with significant amounts, Uefa was informed.
The PSG is owned by the State-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The President of the Seura is acting as an ex-tennisist, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, got more fuel from the salami's neck. The crash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was in the process of carrying out normal operations on the plane at Lounas-Florida International Airport with a couple of workers when suddenly flying from the ocean to the plane.
Salaman's power dropped the plane near Dunn's country.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had a third degree of inflammation around his body.
My father called me and told me that my brother got an e-mail and he's in the hospital.
But I asked if she's alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to his burns, he had muscle damage and brain damage.
The experience was a rare experience for the entire family.
That's not what we're waiting for.
It's traumatic to everyone, Autumn's telling you.
According to the representative of the airport, the safety warning system was at the time of the case and the transport traffic itself decided whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting off
My British training group, Pearson, announced that on Friday it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut by 72% when launching a new system response to the pressures of its business.
According to Executive Director John Fallon, the decreases in jobs are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced the number of jobs in connection with previous construction arrangements.
Pearson once again announced that its costs would be reimbursed by 300 million in May as part of its third savings programme, which is intended to recover from rapid digitalisation as a result of declining business activity.
In the last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partners Bertelsmann. The company announced that it was expected to have a year ahead of its appearance. Its turnover grew by the beginning of the year and was 2.05 billion pounds.
One of the victims in Kabul: Natto's soldier died in suicide
The suicide bomber was killed in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, he was killed in Naton's military and several others were killed.
According to Nato's opinion, five soldiers and an interpreter were beaten.
According to unstable local data, three civilians were also killed in a survey carried out in the Kabul Karabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent earthquake in Afghanistan this month. At least 30 people were killed in a massacre in Herat.
On Monday two people died in the wake of a suicide bomber at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to Nato's opinion, a torrent explosion occurred when the joint party of Naton and Afghanistan's army had to attack "each person by means of its own explosive device".
The resolution stated that all wounded were stable and were treated at the U.S. military base at Bagram airport.
According to letter exchangers, the strengthening of Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Karabagh are important concerns for Naton groups near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan at least 1,662 civilians died in early 2017 at least 20 per cent of the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in the Kabul area, where most of them live in the western world.
Taliban reported being behind the seat.
On the last day of February, Kabul killed more than 150 people in a bomb shelter, which was the most devastating attack on the country after the U.S. leaders had eaten from the Taliban in 2001.
It is ironic that Afghanistan is undermining the situation when President Donald Trump discusses whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help local military and police.
Writers say that in Kabul last week, suicides have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, to exercise it in politics, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA takes its decision on the entry into force of the rules of gravity
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency followed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions caused by the Obaman administration on the day after the 15 Member States had challenged the authority of the Authority.
The EPA announced its decision in 2015 on the implementation of the so-called "horizontal definitions" by midweek. According to the Agency, the decision is evidence of its commitment to cooperation with the Member States.
"We believe in the dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the countries," President Scott Pruitt said in the Bureau's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced that it was the intention of the Agency to launch a zero definition for one year for October 2018. According to the definitions, the drying rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution is to be reduced from then on in accordance with the more stringent air quality requirements.
In December, the Office challenged the right of 15 main democratic states, including the District of Colombia, as well as the establishment.
President Donald Trumpi‚Äôs management has sought ways to improve the early environmental regulations of Barack Obaman. According to Trumpi, measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The Trompi measures have been opposed by democracy and environmental defenders, who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA web pages, without breathing ozone, "may weaken the function of the lungs and increase respiratory problems", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, my father's lead man had also sent to Sydney bomb buildings.
It was suspected that the bomb was intended to be taken to the airport on 15 July, but the company ceased prior to the security investigation.
The police don't tell us why the company stopped.
The other terrorist plan was to build a very colourful gas device and bring it to the public place, e.g. to the public vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Deputy Secretary of State of the Australian Federation, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Sunday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One man has been released free, but he also continues his discourses.
Managing Director: Renewable fuels were very successful
The oil tanker Nesteen arrived before tax fell, but he found prophecies in the second quarter of the year.
According to Executive Director Matt Lievosen, the company had a good effect on oil products, the sales volumes of new products rose to the threshold and the development of the marketing & Services segment was the right direction.
In the last year, comparable trade target improved the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax tax tax.
According to Lievos, the target of new products remained at a high level this year due to higher sales rates and the most favourable markets, even though tax relief was completed.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to announce strategic investments by the end of 2017, Lievonen said in his statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomat≈°enko discuss possible treatment at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomat≈°enko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in the storm course at the near future of the 66.7-kiln series, met for their first time in the tortoise.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN concert hall in Los Angeles, until the WBC's infamous ice-cream master Mikey Garcia traveled long to greet Lomatschenko, WBO's top high-powered master.
Garcia won on Saturday at the first four world-class show at the unanimous decision of Mr. Adrien Broner. After that, Garcia and Lomatschen have been among the five best groups of different classes of stress players on the comparison list.
Garcia put her right hand and asked, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck!
Lomatschen will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on the seventh day of the ESPN Channel.
When two of your posters to photographers, the manager of Lomat≈°enko Egis Klimas noted that the relationship between men would be "perfect in relation to all".
"I'm an old high school student," Garcia recalled.
"I moved the row above [63.5 kilograms] for the bronzery, but I'm not so big.
I'm a little 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light paper.
He's got to get up on the ice sheet [61.2 kilos]. Then we can take it.
That's what our fans want.
Let's do what they want."
Lomatschen felt the same way.
"The company needs this takeover."
The climate asked whether the reception should be organised as a payoff. It is part of his strategy for Lomat≈°enko to develop a strategy that Lomat≈°enko debed in the soft paper later this year and takes his first summer against Garcia (37‚Äì0.30 storm). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the competition between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be held in the soft paper at the Forum on 23 September.
"The lesson could be taxable because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to take the canal that offers the best reward package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is going to wake up as much attention.
I'll agree as soon as we get to the deal..."
Garcia said that she appreciated Lomatschenko as an "extraordinary host" and her goal might be to go see her breakfast.
Lomatschenko cut Garcian's body down and said that this master of three classes from Riverside's home seemed "very thin.
Garcia said she was focusing on showing the picture first and then on her smile.
Men said that they felt that they wanted to be more and more stronger in their relations with each other.
"This is what is expected.
There is no other approach to raising as much attention and interest as possible.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomatashenko said he was waiting for his arrival to take the best. "Mikey is a legend.
That's gonna be a great deal."
Average wage of EUR 5 300, education which is affected - the situation of the investment council has been "dwell and free"
The quality of the investment council has been discussed a lot lately.
Finally, Helsinki spoke of Ritva, 68, where the investment councils of the banking firm were full of poppy investment products for sale.
The rules on the sale of investment councils and various investment products are increasing at the beginning of the year.
The ceilings are based on a new financial market directive which is first applied at the beginning of the year.
At present, the assessment of the ability of employers to sell investment councils and investment products is based almost on self-regulation.
The laws do not define the requirements of competence.
Financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out their own APV1 or APV2 study.
The financial sector has authorised APV investment studies for the organisation of studies to the company Oy, which is part of the study group, both the Financial Supervisory (Fiva) and the experts of both universities and industry.
The studies are extensive 12-15 studies, and their presentations are produced by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which offers the development services of the Department of Transport.
Its website says that, in general, both tenders are "very broad in terms of requirements".
The study materials include 10-15 books and numerous other teachings and thematics.
The APV investment studies of Oy's supplier, Markku Savikko, tell us that there is a sharp percentage of these tenders to be estimated at about 70.
All investment services offer from the staff of the banks of the individuals have been conducted either by APV1 or by APV2, as their performance is mandatory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bank transactions without mentioning names whose staff are affected by the conduct of the carded studies, Savikko says.
According to him, these bank transactions are "some".
According to Saviko, the APV1 study has been conducted between 13,000 and 14 000 people from 2000 and some 3,000 APV2 studies recommended for the most needed investment advice.
Some banking companies consider the benefit of the investigation to be the result of the investigation.
In many other industries, there are much more skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the implementation of the APV studies, since this is where the investment share is ensured.
According to the Statistics Centre, financial and investment firms average several thousand euros per month, including supplies, natural resources and income savings.
The average regular working time for monthly pay is approximately EUR 5,300.
The average number of men working in the professions is 5 900 euros per month and more than 4,500 euros per woman respectively.
The most recent decade is due to an average of around ‚Ç¨8,100.
Ten of the most recent men deserve more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, most recent women are more than ‚Ç¨ 6,400 or more.
In accordance with the investment service, investment advice can only be provided by an authorised company.
At the level of staff and tasks, self-regulation can be ensured.
According to Fiva, its audit included specific cases where the investment council's expertise and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the Council's activities.
The seller of investment products can also act in principle, even if the professionality and competence are at a positive level.
In the beginning, the situation in this part has been wild and free.
In many other sectors there are much more skills requirements, Savikko does.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of the first year of this year, there are difficulties with the new Financial Market Directive (MIFID II).
It requires that each undertaking responds to the fact that the staff providing investment services is sufficient.
For the purposes of financial supervision, the powers shall be conferred on the Commission to determine the extent to which it is required to participate.
Fivan Market Monitor Marco Hovi says that one of the clear changes is currently in the legislation on the ability and experience of investors and investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements relate to both the property of the investment services companies and the owners of the trade unions who sell products for some company.
Hovi says that according to the government of the Ministry of State of Finance, Fiva will be given the power to determine the ability and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided during the coming tribulation.
The company must also continue to provide necessary training and, where necessary, monitoring and supplementary training.
This must all be documented, and the company has the responsibility to demonstrate that it has done the same.
In practice, the company must, for example, draw up personal data at individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different requirements, depending on whether the investment council or the sale of products is concerned.
According to the Court, the new requirement is also to work with someone who has more experience in terms of competence or experience than is sufficient.
However, if the company hires a new employee who does not meet the defined criteria, the employer must work with a certain person for some time.
In my opinion, the rules are fragmented and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products is increasing early in 2018.

Still, there is something special in the system, and products are highlighted in the social media: When will there be a feeling of unwell health?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does the Chief of the Conservatives of the Sinutad said about Aino M√©tat?
We're my partner in the film.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and art painting, M√§ta says.
According to him, products will become a special feature of the movement, and the film will thus be visible.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that products and related stories would have something in common?
Yes, here there is a similar combined story that we are Finnish operators and these are Finnish products, M√§tta says.
According to him, the company has the same basic Finnish rules that support those who have seen the old Unknown War.
And there's no sign of any military culture coming, the method to notice.
Other company companies such as Valio, Hartwall, Saldo, VR and Sato are unknown.

The new results of the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical age of Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the new assessment method show that the tests are over 80 % defined as over 18 years of age. However, all do not consider the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Medicines Agency initiated a test earlier this year.
The tests can be evaluated more accurately by the asylum seeker and in the past. A new test was taken after the Finnish Immigration Agency was assessed that it had failed to determine the actual time of the applicants themselves.
The Immigration Agency has so far conducted 6 880 tests, and the Law Office has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
In addition, 80 per cent of the tests, namely 2002 were determined to be more than 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the law firm determined that the test was "probably 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "probably under 18 years of age".
Tests were carried out only in cases where the applicant had doubts about the time to be notified.
Johan G√∂ransson from the Legal Department says the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The gaps are almost uniform. The differences between the figures in previous months are not detectable," he told The Local page.
Although most applicants were defined as over 18 years of age, they do not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that in the case of 442 there was "the evidence of an 18-year-old or 18-year-old study".
When Svenska Dagblades examined the same results, it was revealed that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told him that he had completed this year 18 years.
In the age assessment method used in the tests, X-ray images are taken from the brain cells and magnetic film. Then dental doctors and radiologists analyzed the images. The procedure is also criticised.
One of the suspects is an endocrinology of the Karoliin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is part of an assessment of human biological abilities. It can be found in an assessment whether the person has become confused before or after.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not correct.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are certainly unable to determine the time, we should not make it possible," he told the Metro-Layout.
However, G√∂ransson of the Office of Medicines, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is in the greatest situation, where the risk is to be tested for 18 years. Then the risk is about 10 percent."

West Virginia Governor Switches Side
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced his change of side on Thursday evening in the Trump campaign.
"Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"And I can tell you after many prayers and fundamentals... today I tell the Western Virgins that I can no longer help you as a ruler of democracy."
The public spoke out against the building's recommendations.
"To-morrow as a member of a registered Republican party," Justice added.
"As a stateman I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made during the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the proposal for democracy for Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he is the only billionaire in the state.
He is the father of a mining company and owns coal projects in five states.
The value of his property is about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) issued an opinion on Thursday morning, which stated that "the government's exchange of Justice is once again a new issue for a democratic party which is more likely to create obstacles than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this case, the Court's statement is the last back to the party where there is no guidance and which cannot be found in a positive, human-friendly statement," RNC representative Ronna McDaniel told CBS in his opinion.
I'll bet you've been cold for a while, but I'll be back in a little bit.
In the last week, doors are also available in South Finland.
Over the past week, it has been particularly in the central and northern regions of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Sume.
In the middle of the week and in the middle of the night, the peacekeepers burned several fires.
According to meteorology, the tortoise may come from this very spring day.
In the last few years, we have also found Finland.
Over the past week, there has been a significant decline in the central and northern regions of the country as well as in the region of Varsinais-Sume.
On the table, a small fire extinguisher caused by a small fireplace in the electric center.
The rescue facility was informed that it would take about half a week.
The electrical center was located at the sauna at the entrance to the railway station.
The rescue facility broke down the roof and wall to find the fireplaces and blew the fire in a smoldering rage.
The total private apartment was left without electricity, but the personnel were spared.
Once again, in the forest, the lake set fire to the outer walls of Harjulantia before half-way.
By the time the rescue plant arrived, the building had already been in full fuel phase, and the rescue plant could not have been otherwise than prevented from spreading the fuel.
About 30 miles [40 km] away, the entire building returned to the ground level.
In the course of this conversation, I'm going to go back to the house of my own.
The residents of the building were outside the building and witnessed a fascinating peacemaking process.
The rescue facility went to the site to check the case, but this time the port didn't get an early firelight - only a few holes broke.
In the transport sector, problems arose by linking the wall between the Wall and the Waas, when peace broke down the traffic control system.
The information was sent on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the railways were replaced by line cars.
The problem was solved just before 5:00 a.m.
Later, the railways have been able to continue normally also by means of rail.
The salts have been frozen to destroy various parts of Finland.
However, Islam has been relatively small in this era.
These events of this period have been very impressive! evaluates the modern meteorology of the Air Station Jari Tuvinen.
The midweek and tortoise peaks have been mainly positive, but because of the low volume of the cheese, it is even more powerful.
This might feel really hard at the door, but that's when it's like the door of this person's body, Tuvinen's word.
On the average week, the land was hit by 1,700 times, and there were potential in the towers even on the hottest day: about 16 hours in the plaques there were 1,790 landslides.
If the greeting is still on the front side, it can be obtained by over two thousand greetings, Tuvinen's prophecy.
The previous forecast year was launched in 2015, with a peak of some 30,000 chapters per year.
By midweek, the number of secrets this year had reached 18 386.
It's still interesting, then, that this year would not be affected by the return of two years.
However, it can be expected to continue.
According to the guide, Finland also remains in the air during the weekend as a hot and expensive environment for the outdoors.
The main point of the doors is to move south of the northern part of the country, where about 2,000 peace days can be found on both the sun and the sun.
The central part of the country is allowed to be more uniform.
In such cases, according to Tuvise, it's only rare to cry.
Coe exceeds Russia's "open" request for forgiveness of doping scandal
The world's public health authority Sebastian Coe went on to describe an open application for forgiveness submitted by Russia for the doping scandal as a torrent. However, Coe added that it has not been time to end Russia's participation ban.
Russia's Director General Dmitri Schljahtin said that as a result of MM cases in Torstana at the IAAF Congress that Russia's refusal is appropriate and that he is going to fight specifically against doping.
He said that he was sorry "for all the athletes who were held in competition with gold or ivory".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress was voted against in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was shut down in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office in the WADA report provided evidence of the state's support for doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open presentation," IAAF President Coe told the suppliers.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that Russia's General Security Council agreed to travel through difficult times and announced its efforts to reorganise its activities."
Coe said he was also "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for granting a ban.
"I think we have had the right day to build and progress has taken place, but the Congress supports the working group's recommendation that there is no time now to stop Russia's refusal," Coe said.
"We have to do this in a few months to normalize the situation.
The principle has always been that we want to keep the pure athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nine hundred Russian athletes compete in the status of a neutral athlete in London during the first half of the MM competition. They have met the strict criteria of IAAF.
The head of the IAAF Working Group, Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia must still meet many requirements before it can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient and those who have received the operational report are still free of charge," he told the suppliers on Friday after his presentation in London to the IAAF Council.
The company failed to break Tom of Finland's image
Tom of Finland didn't come from any success as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If it is true, I have been disappointed to recognise the film produced by Helsinki film director Annika Sucksdorff Ylen in the challenge.
I was afraid that the Finnish film industry might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film was first won in February 2017.
By the end of June it had targeted 100 000 viewers, which has been budgeted for about EUR 5 million, compared with less.
There's nothing wrong with this, but it's important now that investors get their own way back.
If the movie had gone home better, they'd have gotten their money.
Now you have to wait for a little bit of dust outside of distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
How the economic rules of football affect the move of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the use of European football competitions do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain from Barcelona to France Paris Saint-Germain.
Its possible follow-up to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will determine the UEFA, which can prevent the participation of groups overestimated Masters.
UEFA adopted the economic rules of the race game in 2011. According to these, the PSG must be able to demonstrate that the Neymar move has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's new annual bank is moving in ten million dollars.
There are many economic aspects related to the movement of Neymar in France.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and joining her to its star charts, as the following is funded by Qatar's oil-rich management team.
The consequences can be used for the acquisition of large amounts of players, but they must be balanced by real income sources so that the business related to football is not fatal.
The economic rules for the game were set up as the UEFA President of the French-elected Michel Platin in 2007.
As a former football player, Platin believed that the goal of success by borrowing was fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners were to seek their support.
In 2011, the emphasis on the economic rules of the game moved from the tracks to follow their losses.
The change meant that for the first time, the business performance of Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 was very difficult. Abramovish bought a promising team, used a large amount for player projects and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of assessment of the financial rules of the game will last until 2018. During this period, the monitors will be able to lose up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platin had to leave UEFA President in a scandalous position in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wanted to delay the use of unmanaged funds.
"The rules of the game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who was responsible for the UEFA's economic rules, told the Associated Press office last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with multiple payments, it can distribute the amount in the book to the full duration of its new contract.
Neymar has made a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
On the basis of the financial rules of the game, the first sanctions were awarded in 2014. Most sanctions were imposed on PSG and on the Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received EUR 60 million, which was reduced to EUR 20 million later. In addition, it was intended to limit the Masters' over 21 players during 2014-2015 rather than 25 players.
The UEFA shall monitor the consequences that may attempt to reverse its economic rules by increasing its income through companies related to the owners.
If, for example, the Qatarian company supports PSG but the aid value is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not consider it to be a genuine result.
This was the case when UEFA concluded in 2014 that the aid granted by the Qatar Travel Authority to the PSG was excessive.
It has also been noted that part of Neymar‚Äôs benefits under the PSG could be financed by paying for the 2022 foot-and-mouth disease in Qatar from the MM competition organisation.
However, the PSG and the management team have refused to have Neymar in the process of sending MM competitions. UEFA would be very easy to detect such a system.
Due to the above-mentioned sanctions of the PSG, UEFA is normally more closely followed by companies operating around the rules.
The sources of the situation reported to Tortina that UEFA had not consulted with PSG for Neymar's transfer.
The sources presented a challenge to the Associated Press News Agency, provided that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the powers to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published accounting decision, the PSG‚Äôs turnover from 2015 to 2016 was EUR 542.4 million and its target was over EUR 10 million.
The report has not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar to reach new sponsors and to sell more follow-up products and toys.
Seura estimated that its trade change would increase by at least 30 per cent through the Neymar Agreement.
From the start of the world's best player, too much of Spain tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move. It was claimed to violate the economic rules of the game.
"This is clearly an economic doping event and a follow-up to both the state," Spanish President Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS government. He referred to PSG's Qatarian property.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger is also cautiously aware of the state's funding for the role of football.
"The situation is a consequence of property which has changed the working environment of the football industry for the last 15 years," Wenger said in Torstana.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It must be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of the game. There are so many interests that a famous player represents the state."
Now it's fast: Finnish MM-resultner in Helsinki
The long-term driver Artu Pajulahden and the triangular maker Kristina M√§kel√§, Siren Ghazaryan, is in Helsinki, although he should be preparing a general insurance in MM in London.
Kristiina M√§kele may have to compete without her maker's advice.
In the morning he competes in a long-distance box and M√§kele in a three-morning box tomorrow.
Two manufacturers, however, Armenian Ghazaryan has not received a visa from the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in the British Embassy.
The preparer has the name of the organizers of MM cases as a document, but no one has been able to get a visa.
This is exactly the first Brexit symptoms, or what President Jorma Kemppain said.
He's always been dealing with visas successfully on his own, but now there's some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Institute SUL for years.
It doesn't matter so much.
Whenever anyone looks at the stadiums at the signs on the ground, Artu Pajulaht told his cook about the possible absence.
MM-metal to Finland from London requires a miracle
The MM competitions for general insurance start in London today on Friday and continue on Monday, 13 August after the end of the week.
General pollution, drought and drought are the types in which the Finnish money raisers have an amazing attitude toward another year, whether it comes from success or not.
The success in the hearts of the pendulums is measured in meters.
Toki's got other dimensions.
At the very least, the beautiful growth patterns of young athletes will remain of value to one another, where experience enables the performance of the athlete to the level that the adult MM meter is really possible.
Now there are not such young athletes in the small MM group in Finland, nor are they really concocted.
MM-metal requires a miracle for Finland.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of the sport is that people can also be hurt.
It leads the money dealers to the TV show and leads them to follow the cheeses, even though London's medals are decided from early in the evening.
Finland received one proscitatel of the previous MM cases in 2015.
That's what led to the defeat of Tero Pitk√§mek.
The believers look forward to the length of time that will last, even if they repeat the results of the last days of his life and of the rest of his life in the last few years.
Walked in these streets anyway, Beck√§m√§ck will remain a great Finnish actor in history.
Access to other Finnish actors of the case to final competition or to make their own prediction is good enough.
The hope and belief of the real-time meth leadership of the coming years of Finland‚Äôs general government gives good success in the international values of young people today.
The distribution of young people‚Äôs gifts and the financial support of their work are more important than the small group of representatives.
This process will not come at any time but will require years of hard work for both athletes and for patience, both in preparation and in retirement.
Finnishs are also able to appreciate international toys and enjoy their unique performances.
It is hoped that London will remain in the history of Usasin Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of the fear of terrorism or the fear of burning.

Viking Linen a new long-standing start to port in Helsinki
Viking's new long-term start of FSTR is very late.
The long-distance ship was supposed to leave Helsinki at 6:00 p.m.
In eight countries there were children on board.
It's already late for Helsinki.
I've been waiting for at least half an hour to get on board.
Now the car moves a little, the official Johannes Rebane waiting at the port of Helsinki told me at 19.30.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told us that the shipping company had brought in ships to access water bottles waiting in their cars.
The Viking's intelligence officer Christa Gr√∂nlund tells the IS that the device has become a technical fault.
It was done at Helsinki's port.
The ship's leaving Helsinki a couple of hours later.
Gr√∂nlund says the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's backyard for a couple of hours.
The ship was to leave Tallinn back in Helsinki at 20.15.
42-metre special transport disturbs the transport on Saturday morning tortoise
42 metres long special transport moves from Other Mustola to port during the tortoise night.
The transport from 9 should be on track until midnight.
The police are driving on the highway, and your traffic can be stopped for a while.
From the point of view of the road, the road goes 13 miles from the port of Mustola.
Small nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, both the days of the 80th and the 90th wedding (at which time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the wonderful series of The State MTV) and their own time ‚Äì in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series were transferred to the most exciting events.
As a cultural product it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory we've been affected by on Facebook.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's always alive.
First Day of Camp works very well, and not only because of its absurd humor (including H. Jon Benjamin‚Äôs voice was called behind).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged viewers are looking at the almost complete-age characters of the jokes. Its emphasis makes it part of the joke about the inability to aim for the past.
The Years Later, where adults appear to be adults, is less sensitive, and its parody is more difficult: for example, it is sponsored by 90-bit steel wires, such as the terrible painting of the Hand that is moving.
In a particular paragraph, one of the best ways to show up Apple Powerbook, inline roulettes and "other cow since 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as they were before.
The approval of Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet reached the Castle (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in some madness there is Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which is partly Michael Ian Black).
As always in such rows, the best are the sides.
It's a special pleasure to see young Paul Rudd, who has a low-end party, namely Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie Singles. Ruddin's performance, Andy, king of the village, is already an old mother.
The moments of casual madness may arise as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its clear decision: Wet Hot American Summer ‚Äì Twenty Years Later. At its last meeting, the group will go to Wet Hot American Summer on the first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series is again featured in another nostalgia: The American series of Cold Wars, the Atomic Blonde and even the Glow series, where it is located in the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been led by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Roman police play in the 1980s, where a kawastelistic rival fights for truth, atheism and marketing.
In the main sections of Gregorina and idealistic Josephina are found in Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelou Ulic. They have dubated their English Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But a lot of things don't happen then.
The series contains some good visual jokes (police spend time watching TV chess the same way Americans see football).
There are a number of famous speakers, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, who will have a very funny game.
However, Comrade Detective will be too attached to the follow-up of the social drama ‚Äì including, for example, the killer of Reagan's name back. Therefore, the series often begins with a real sense of peer propaganda.
The six lengths are too long, and the tire of the line is not fast enough and not raw.
A well-defined line could work better as an agitprop satellite, even when Gregor and Josef are traveling back to the United States in the vast outback and in the valley there are always two fleshly men in the densest hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and food.
The romantic Roman creatures of the series were not wrong: our ambitions were to ruin our own neighborhood history and their own history.
Toni Tauru is up on Sunday in Macao - against the former UFC opportunist
Toni Tauru wants to keep the take-off.
Toni Tauru gets a strong fight against Macao because Brazilian Leandro Isa took it back in the last year in the UFC organization.
Brazilians also have a campaign of black night and a kind of world heritage.
I'm taking myself against my parents.
It's an interesting story, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
He was supposed to be coming up to someone in Indonesia last afternoon.
The competition was started because of the logistical problems, but three competitions were held on a long-term scale in the Chinese self-government area of Macaon.
The sea has never met before.
This was the first time I got my deal started.
It happened because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the learner is pleased that the competition will have a new time.
A week's waiting doesn't just affect the preparation.
The transfer doesn't affect the kingdom, because it's not immediately a week away.
It can get worse if you practice too much.
In the previous campaign, the country has faced opponents whose strengths are in the process of stopping.
This time your situation is different.
His father's hairstyle describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's pretty aggressive.
I'm sorry he's gonna come to some hard first and try to get the matto.
He's won the Jewish world empire, so he's got a lot of weight.
The previous removal of cotton did not work out according to the plans.
The Philippinesan Kevin Belssa found Tauura to be a bad sight, and the Philippines won.
I've never done that very well in my ability. He's never got any money.
When I went to see him, he got my eyes on my face.
It's been a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the volunteers get up once a year, some get up closer.
For example, the next opponent, Jesus, was arrested in September.
For the last year there have been three arrests.
Now there's a second race last year.
There's been a lot of trouble outside.
I've been training for the past few years and I've been good all the time.
However, I've only been arrested for taking it.
When he was 32 years old, he heard about the coming meeting, and he decided to change into a country.
I was in Espoo at the train station, and I had the joy of doing it again.
We got really good trains when there was a friend from Sweden.
The exercise was a great help, as Sunday morning a coward has to save a physical contest.
I've been able to train all the same opponents and exercise the ability to do so.
It's a 32-year-old decision-making tactic.
It's got to be smart.
If there's a chance, I'm gonna go get that thing myself.
The discounts can't be given free because they're mostly used.
Macao is attracted to the Taura, formerly held in China.
It's heard from China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great night ahead.
The central bank of England has an increase of 0.25 per cent
The central bank of England is expected to announce that it will hold interest before economic growth has been inexhaustible and inflation has stopped speculating from inflation.
The central bank of England has warned that economic growth continues to decline. The bank has transferred its savings as family income is increasingly under stress.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank‚Äôs financial policy firm decided to increase from 6 to 2 by 0.25 per cent.
In its four-year inflation audit, the bank calculated its growth rate in 2017 to 1.7 per cent and its forecast in 2018. It also warned that domestic outputs are increasingly under stress, as inflation is still expected to rise by nearly three per cent in the fast season.
However, in recent years there has been a need to reduce Brexit's accelerated inflation.
In addition, the members of the documentation decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which was launched a year later in the post-Brexit vote.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected that it will now provide a successful funding to banks with a total of 15 million pounds (115 million).
The report on the Bank‚Äôs collapse states: ‚ÄúThe short development of gross domestic product in the financial sector is continuing in recent years as the real income growth of households decreases consumption, according to the financial document.
With regard to the increase, the Bank reiterated that in order to reduce inflation, it would need to "record some of the financial policy" market expectations "a little wider".
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases are "achievable" and "border".
In May the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for the first year.
It now accounted for an increase of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
The pound decreased as a new result of the dollar and the euro.
The dollar score decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. For the euro it decreased by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision must be taken prior to the expected decline in the expected growth of the expected increase in the expected growth of the expected increase in the expected increase in the growth of the growth. The GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to continue by 0.3 per cent at the end of the third quarter, but only at the end of the year.
In its early years, the inflation rate gave little hope of rapid inflation and severe wage cuts to households. According to the bank, the situation is getting worse before it changes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the calculation of income in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will continue "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of poor soil, which is partly due to the impact of private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the increase was calculated by 0.25 % after the EU referendum, which was due to red tape.
The Bank considers that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the decision taken by the Central Bank on the basis of the decision taken by the bank, the Court of Auditors had begun to demand more and more votes when inflation imposed pressure on households. Three decision-makers claimed 0.5 per cent weight in July.
Inflation was released by 2.6 per cent in the last month of June by 2.9 per cent. However, according to the bank, it was expected and inflation was re-increased in the near-month period.
According to the Bank, the overrun of its two-percent target resulted in a "all-in-kind" of weak soil.
"In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, competition on the housing market would appear to be worsening in the future when creditors are asking customers for a strong end of the year," says Coreco Mortgage Brokers, director Andrew Montlake.
"The markets look particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is in conclusion. The new agreements are more popular than they are, their prices are low and the offer also offers unlimited options."
NHS for 10 000 HIV-containing medicines
From September onwards, patients can be given a "reversible" HIV medicine. At the highest level, a decision was made regarding the financing of the medicine in the public health system in England (NHS).
The NHS reported that the pre-treatment treatment (PREP) prior to exposure is assigned to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Justice had ruled in force in the final year of the judgment. Accordingly, NHS could pay the PrEP even if it was claimed that local authorities should finance it.
English NHS leader Simon Stevens called Torstana's decision "significantly new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as "solvable for a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to take reports of experience that extends to other clinics in October 2018.
Pre-treatment of exposure (PREP) must be accompanied by a combination of HIV therapy that reduces tartarism.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Before combining the medicinal product, the body has sufficient medicinal products to prevent HIV transmission.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment group includes homosexuals, bisexual men and transsexuals, and people with my HIV positive partner who cannot be treated effectively.
Patients choose the test conditions for both male, female and transsexual applicants and those who do not know that they are receiving antiretroviral treatment with their HIV positive partner.
People living in England and receiving treatment from a general physician may also apply for experience in local sexual health clinics.
The programme pays 10 million pounds, and England's NHS signed this week after an international tendering agreement.
The purpose of the test is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting a broad clinical indication of its focus, use and implementation.
"This important new intervention should complement and strengthen existing multilateral and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the ongoing struggle to solve mankind's greatest health problems for more than 30 years."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
"If the PrEP is properly addressed to those in need and groups of risk, it may have a significant impact on the AIDS epidemic in England.
Since September, the risk group has received a drug from the NHS-financed experience that they can decide for themselves without having to consult with their partner. It must have a powerful effect that will improve the lives of so many people.
This was a welcome news."
"Now it is essential to ensure that the test is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group should remain outside it," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine to be used in the test has been obtained, and we can soon protect tens of thousands of people from HIV transmission."
"The start of the PrEP test has been a welcome event that has been delayed for several months due to delays in government," said Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson of the Ministry of Public Health.
"We have an indication that the medicine can have a turnaround effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop this dangerous disease.
Experience helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the test be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so we can protect HIV victims and get closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV into society has succeeded in halting it."
Quality of life: In the middle and fixed solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment house
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who was involved in the repair of the apartments, moved from Knightsbridge to the smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is King Anna's home on the first floor of the old house. Remont's success tells us that Joanne has not yet been packed into his camps and changed.
"That was before I lived with my ex at Knightsbridges in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment and noticed that the rooms were as high as those in my apartment.
I liked it right away and made an offer the same day."
After that, about 90 fourths of the apartment has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a two-bedroom room where only the kitchen was available. Joanne wanted to have more storage space and an interstellar so that room height could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demand," she says.
He hired work on Erfan Azadin Notting from the Duck & Shed Planning Office located in Hills. Erfan was assigned to use almost four metres of the high room and to create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale site but also home.
The height of the room was not exactly enough for the two upper floor, so the challenge was to build an interconnected stop.
The fight requires Erfan to create a mind.
"The steel structures are time-consuming.
The streets had to be arranged in such a way that they did not need to be cornered.
Buildings had to be designed so that the height was just suitable for both them and below."
Erfan was able to place more than two fully furnished rooms on top of the apartment.
The Retrouvius cupartist window opens in an area of satisfaction.
Hidden rooms, hope hostels and Serge Mowillen wines create the most famous style.
The use of mirrors is that of the theatre, the sense of the situation and the light.
On both sides of short use, the holes can be used to influence the real length of time.
The hole in the middle of the kitchen is like a window that opens the view to the other room.
Inland waterways, there is a storage room for Joannen for Aterems and stock stocks.
The comfort increases that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens equipped with skill are not a new solution,
But in Joannen's kitchen there's the only thing that's going on up the same way as the car's door.
"It required a little planning," Erfan says about the hard-rolled MDF.
"It's balanced, i.e. it's moving up very easily to places."
With the next use and maintenance plan, Joanne received 16 extra rooms, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
"When the apartment is sold, the area is resolved ‚Äì or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the case of the first case, a fixed-rate operator shall travel within the apartment and calculate the price on the basis of the area."
In Joannen's apartment, the area was added by using high-quality materials that contribute to the overall situation.
"The apartment is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the sense of the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one's interested in the power lines on the wall.
They're important, but they're not the same."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good planning and extras can make basic accommodation exceptional.
Then it can also be used so that the apartment no longer wants to change.
In a pregnant princess, Sofia set up her summer class
Princess Sofia's apartment got stuck.
In Princess Sofia, Sweden was the last time she was born.
A Sustainable Tomorrow's event to the princess in the evening had chosen her election machine.
Sofia's been successful as a humorous man.
In Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia took part in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a beautiful blue-collared home that was beautifully dressed as the last pregnant princess.
Sofia was able to take place in a densely populated community.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before its birth.
The time he's calculated is September.
For the night of the event, Sofia had chosen the most beautiful pastelin engine that was going down.
The Tyllian crowns were big, and the stylely little box.
It's a pastelin suit of beauty in the princess.
Sofia's been on a tour this week in Sweden's B√°stad.
Sofia is full of you living in a small room.
Sofia's going to follow the rules in her summer class.
Sofia was excited about what happened even talking to photographers.
Now I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut, Sofia said she was laughing and she was referring to her end-of-life.
He's gonna grow us a pretty chili cake.
In the summer of 1996, Lahden showed up at a house where domestic food was sold.
The lattices didn't believe in corn, but they walked away.
At home food sold to Panya Suamsri Pent, known as Panja.
He didn't even take part in Finland, and the Finnish didn't take part in the Thais at the time.
Because the people didn't believe in going to eat, Panja offered free meals.
This is how he taught the lattices to eat an ant while he was on the beach.
From the country, he said.
I left a record of the meeting.
I've gone more and more, at the end of every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai market in Lahden.
There were two small tables there. We had less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to his fan.
When there is a limited hunger and places, there is no room for emptying between yourself and the visitor.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat on a table at the end of the day to study with the speaker.
Two years went by the store department, but then the restaurant had to be changed, because the self-contained mussetanas would smell too much.
From the end of the business administration, a new place was set free.
There's room.
Now we drivers are allowed to sit back at our own table, only at the most appropriate times we have to dream of asking the visitors if there is a room nearby.
Panja knows her client.
He's been told where he's been used and who he's seen.
He knows what everyone eats.
He's seen how customers' lifestyle changes and their diet changes.
She remembers what I went to eat with a man named I had my first lunch.
He remembers me as a soul and as a child, and he remembers how young I was.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than anyone else, sit at my place next to the kitchen door and exchange your belongings with a bagful of Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught harmony and internationality in the realm of chilicism.
He has opened up our minds and hearts in addition to our sleep.
Now many talk to him about taita... thanks to the growing advice of the trip.
I love Panja.
Even though she's been hard, she's always friendly.
He's a cop.
He's on the restaurant. He's going to the wall and the museum.
In the last week, the restaurant held a two - year course of full - time service.
We're customers. We've got a manicure.
Without notice or attention, this important day went by, at the end of the work.
On the ground support point, 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to take their place in Europe
Security authorities have received a list of important counter-terrorism work since the beginning of the year.
The list contains more than 170 information from Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to German newspaper Die Welt, 173 persons are in total, and the document contains images of each one in addition to their personal information.
More than 130 of the individuals mentioned in the list are Irish, but there are also six Europeans.
They're home from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The end is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Tonight-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks behind.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been updated.
According to the letter, the Iraqi military special teams found the personal information and images of terrorists in the study of the terrorist organization's land base in Mosul.
In the United States, the intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol in advance.
The list was distributed through Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
As a result, I was afraid that something big and serious would have been planned in the west of the terrorist action of Isis in the near future.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and images of all persons, they also have their birthplaces, subspecies and information about the home of the person.
The list also contains specific terrorist specialities.
For example, the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads the name of the fighter Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is told to travel first to Egypt, then through Libya and later through Turkey to join the Isis border in 2012.
His picture has been written on the screen as a special suicide bomber.
There's no more information about a man's fate.
Europe has sent some 6,000 fighters to Isis' ranks, which are not safe from the fate.
A man needed a floor under the Helsinki Tokoinra.
On the basis of the challenges of the rescue facility, the man wanted to show that time was running.
It can save the dying soul.
Helsing's Tokoinran was rescued as a tortoise under water.
According to the day-to-day palome of the Helsinki rescue plant Ville Estlander, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found outside the water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue plant's locker found him on the floor, Estlander tells me.
The rescue unit received a notice half past four in the evening.
The person was handed over for primary care.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
On the basis of the questions, the man wanted to show how much time he had to spend.
The situation in Tokyo is over.
Estlander is grateful for the cooperation of the authorities with the National Guard and the police.
This was the task of the head of the Border Guard.
Local artists also taught the performers a great deal.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the National Guard and the police.
Two cars hit your car in Eureka - nine people in cars, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars who ended up getting bigger noises, telling the daily fireman.
There are men and women in the group of victims of rape.
An accident occurred on three roads in four days.
It happened when the other car turned to security three in front of the other car, the daily pilot tells me.
According to the rescue facility, the cruise area has a speed limit of 80 km.
Brothers fight for more than $500 million
Two of the brothers are arguing about Victoria‚Äôs largest estate empire, which is worth more than $500 million.
The former chairman and founder of Carlton's football club Colin De Lutis lives only in Toorak‚Äôs precious area at the entrance of his three younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought his highest right to dispute the property of the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but he's gone to the point of nocturnal conflict.
The brothers and their mother Anna owned together 38 units worth over half a billion dollars. The family began to share property when they bought the trade from Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans shop, which extended to 160 movements.
The trade ticket was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The funds were used to the units, and the family now owns the offices, rural development areas in Brunswick and Sorento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as municipal shopping centers.
According to the family's previous agreement with the father, Colin owns about two thirds of the property of the company and Paul about three thirds of the company. Paul describes his father as "the power of the family and the central pillar".
According to legal documents, the share of property means Colin owns units of about $316 million and Paul of about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the housing and finances.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first letter to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with last spring in the highest court following several settlement companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who is in charge of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has shut him off.
Colin says he doesn't like his place.
Colin writes together one of his first preliminary evidence that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin says in his opinion.
The cost of the event continues to increase. The number of random opinions, e-mails and reports is hundreds of pages. The event explains such consultancy companies as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer as well as the best and most experienced experts in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her former husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded dairy farms and farms in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as insurance for the family when they bought from Collingwood a building that Colin founded for the family's first trade in pastry.
Colin says that he established a trade "in the last few years when Paul was a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer their properties to their husband in a proper manner.
"Louigi has often stated that he does not want the right of the brothers to decide," Anna writes in her opinion.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. Colin says Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million by leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "a stricter source of economic conditions".
Colin has had a low profile, even though he has been a former member of the Australian football team and television director Eddie McGuiren's best friend, according to the life pattern of this year 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis as well as their experts.
He told me in the text that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's being dealt with in court.
"I am very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to law and bring our family to justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother‚Äôs requirements.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted us to be enough in this way," Colin continued, and told her hope that the matter would be resolved.
In the evening, hope seemed the same.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future," Colin wrote.
Whether the new staff member of Trump is going to restrict the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly gets lucky last night.
First of all.
According to the Politico page, the new White House staff member is planning to limit President Trump's media use and monitoring of news so that the bomb does not become so difficult.
Actor Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new staff member of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the lead staff on his first working day, he spoke about the central problem he is going to solve: he is going to limit President Donald Trump's information.
Kelly told the White House staff that all information ‚Äì both printed and heard in the media ‚Äì must be transported through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets the best information."
Kelly's words are reasonable, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failed.
President Trumple has a ten-year-old relationship with television ‚Äì and he still sees a lot of television.
"If President Trump expressed misgivings about the news, he was encouraged by the fact that the media dealt with matters more equally," said Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant in the Trump campaign in February.
Politicians Tara Palmer wrote that "the management of the use of Trumpi Twitter according to the six previous campaign workers is essential that its personal media industry is a source of the same body".
All right.
But it's funny to say that the use of Trump Twitter would never have been under control.
Maybe these campaigners know something we don't know about, maybe the Trump tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We're probably never gonna know what messages from Trump were sent without it.
If his personality has even been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been futile.
However, no one has been able to prevent Trumpia from causing it.
The problem is partly because there are competitive groups in the White House who are trying to keep their business informed by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be trusted ‚Äì or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers would provide the President with meaningful information on this matter.
Actor Shane Goldmaker reported on a particular case:
"The current and former workers of the trumpet say that he can be ostracized by the papers in which he is respected ‚Äì especially if they tell him of the difficult years of information. Then he has to find out where the information is from.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of the newspaper of the new GotNews.com website, founded by the new President, Katie Walshia, who was accused of several years of information from the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of his concern, and he had previously spread false accusations and subsequently dropped them. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had begun to read about the personality of Walshi."
Goldmaker added that such staff officers, Reince Priebus and the Secretary of Staff Rob Porter of the White House "were trying to use the system of management of documents going to Trump".
And what happened?
Kelly's gonna try the same three months later.
Perhaps he becomes more effective as a leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his assistant still running his own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar with the PSG of the five-year agreement
Brazilian statesman Neymar is a five-year-old French football match with the PSG, says the news agency AFP.
In the past Thursday evening, Neymar's representatives were told that they had paid the football for FC 222 million in Barcelona, which played over Spain.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to the PSG.
The most recent EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
A previous forecast was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
The PSG is owned by the State-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The President of the Seura is acting as an ex-tennisist, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to have reached Paris in the spring.
Writer Raija Oranen quoted alcohol and flying games as saying, "I'm fine with my life"
From TV series Russia's time and Clean white banners, well-known successful writer Raija Oranen placed his 69-year-old day.
Hypnosis helped me get away from Heaven Ora.
Five of the children will keep their moms so near writing that Father and his wife, Jyrki, were released from the east of Spain and from the residence of Fuengirola after 18 winter.
First they sold their house, but now this summer they also went to the rental apartment.
In the heavens and the sun, apart from the old world around the Earth, there is a time for weakness and alcoholism that he has revealed.
There's also a 20 kilos cooler outdoor.
The pressure started to fall when serotonin medicinal products were discontinued.
I was able to help alcoholics at any time from hypnosis, which also led to a plane crash, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Drinking alcohol from people, a contented writer says it's open.
The border and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same route for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the border and travel area, has been working together for over 40 years.
I kissed her, and it was my wedding going for two weeks, the dance of the Raija.
He's always been the king of that drama. He's finished his life from that thing.
The great bookstore of Oranen remembers only the good 44th of the Holy Whites TV series that touched and moved into Finland's playtime.
Finally, I decided to become the company industry of the National Company when I read the 50th anniversary of the 50th anniversary of Addis Ababa on the plane.
I was the daughter of a bully myself, my mother also had a vision and sometimes a mannequin, oran‚Äôs memory.
The time and history of this series changed the Finnish attitude toward business.
Anita Saveli's research and claims it is obvious, Oranen says.
The border of Oranen lives as an active writer, having hundreds of ideas under his hands.
The tourers returned the door to the "Millions" form.
The most early economicists in the West Midlands are once again supporting themselves with self-sustained roundabouts who succeeded in crossing the gaping door and returning home to the next ball.
The tourers stopped tens of thousands of people in their homes near a cave called Solihullis.
They were taken out of the area in May, but they succeeded in overcoming the fear of being driven into a wheelchair. They brought with them children, horses, and packagers.
The rounds succeeded in crossing the crossing point that had been left unguarded for the sake of Poland.
The people who have been displaced have accused the city of Solihul of "the problem of full capacity".
An unnamed residence tells the people who came to the town of Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had been lying on the rocks.
"The society must be forced to act because it feels completely capable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, and then they left but returned.
They came up in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident said that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by preventing access to the villages.
"I live on Streetbrook Road, and I have to pay the royal tax when the citizen can't do anything about it."
According to another unnamed resident, it must be funny that the rounds returned so soon after they were expelled.
"They're more than before, and they've even been down on the horse to roll into the field."
According to Solihull's well-known informant, the public is aware of the unconstitutional interference with the road. "We are engaged in the legal action required by Solihull's police to eliminate the perpetrators as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible do so to inform the police of the disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to shape the overall picture for legal proceedings."
The violent people were confined to the Portuguese mahogany
In Portugal, men who have been forced to stay on the coast have been heard in law today.
As a result of the rape, two people died last night.
Two men flying on the plane may be charged with the immortality of the dead.
At least 16 years of imprisonment can take place in Portugal.
The flight of men had to be made yesterday because of the technical burden on the coast of S√£o Joao da Caparican near Lisbon.
On the beach there were hundreds of people who had an accident, part of which had to drop the engine into the water.
The plane reached a 56-year-old man and 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first arrived at the man who was on that plane.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up and, when it dropped again, it hit the child‚Äôs head, told Philipe Janeira de Noticias on the beach.
Her death was reduced by sea with her parents.
The girl's parents aren't disappointed.
On the beach, the sailors crossed the small boat immediately after the storm.
The girl's father and other people went to the car and started to find her family, told the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the flighter a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
There were two men on the plane who didn't get hurt in the heat.
The tragic loss of her leg was the victory of the MM gold again: "I wouldn't be the world's master."
Matti Great-Hamar celebrated the festival early Wednesday in Finland during the MM-gold Banks held in a competition in Big White, Canada.
The Great Hamari also won the cross MM gold.
All MM samples have been repeated three times now.
It's an incredible time for MM!
Two times they were treated with gold, a time of good running water, a great time for your phone call.
At the age of 30, a reader thanked his cook and very happy preparation in Finland.
According to Major-Hamar, the number of respondents in species is growing all the time.
The entire parallel vehicle has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are small, and there's a lot of new discounts.
He always thinks he's gonna get some black horse.
Every guy feels like he's a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had taken an invigorating approach from a young man to his friends, and the accident did not bring him a desire to get to the beach.
I'm going to think for a while what my life would be without that accident.
But my position has always been that it's a waste of dust.
These cards play what has been divided into the Great Hamari press.
It would be a good idea to title serious accidents and the loss of the border as a success, and not the Great Hamari.
But he turned into a tough one.
Yes, I would say that your situation has been a success.
I wouldn't be a triangular world master without an accident.
Before the accident of 23-year-old Great Hammar, the greatest performance was already on the horizon.
To Dunn, the top of the hill began to move to the true work only after an accident.
I trained as a young man with friends, and we always killed X-games.
But they were distant wounds that disappeared after a while.
After the accident, I found myself there from the start of X-Games.
I wouldn't have taken the picture before.
I was 23 years old and thought it would be a real long life if I stayed here to break up and die.
I decided to take the sharks down to the bottom and start working.
I'd say I've had a good time.
The dancer was very pleased with Leo-Pekka's selection as the year's athlete.
A four-year-old Olympic winner received his award in January in a long sports field.
According to the Great Hammer, the victory of the Black Sea is an important signal to the coastal people.
It was really a big deal, and it was definitely worth it.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the universe.
Since it's time to launch the two-year World Championship campaign for the year, Matti Big Hammar?
I'll see you later.
I'm trying to make my best success.
The Great Hamari has not yet ruled over all the tops of its power.
First year there's a big goal.
A year later, paralympics are being used in South Korea.
Let's get out of there and find out what it is!
Most Syrian refugees do not believe their return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and Isis leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees revealed the ideas and positions of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
The Syrian refugees are found in the refugee camp in Jordan.
Most Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return home.
The Trumpi administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller Communication Office explained the opinions and positions of young Syrians in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying Arab opinions and positions for nine years.
This year‚Äôs A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees revealed the ideas and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Your study in February-March 2017 totaled 400 from 18 to 24 years of Syrian youth, half of which are women and half men.
Half of the challenges were carried out in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe in their return home in the future.
42% of respondents may think about returning home and four percent did not agree.
According to the study, the decision of young people to move home is mainly affected by the war in Syria and by the approaching Isis country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most effective factor in the ongoing domestic conflict, when Isis' departure from the country was considered to be the most important factor in the view of the fourth century.
Only under ten stands up as the most important factor in the decision to improve the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions are not the only solution to conflict
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than the release of President Bashar al-Assad.
The fourth is to consider the presidency of al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half of them are experiencing the need for political and military solutions to put an end to the ongoing Syrian conflict.
The solution to the conflict by mere military action does not seem to be the same as the fourth.
Most Syrian refugees see the fall of the Isis regime during the last year when they again experience its strength.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against Isis, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would inform people that Isis had nothing to do with Islam.
There are close links between military measures and education.
In the view of the 10th anniversary of the armed conflict, it would be important to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the effects of the Trumpi regime, 66% of the respondents believed that the conflict did not change during Trump‚Äôs reign.
Nearly every one of the four believes in the terrible conflict between Syria and Trump.
The opinion is divided into two aspects: whether Russia or Iran's participation has improved or improved the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time in code to keep the web in order - for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Explosives Company MariaDB develops the database of open source codes of "the fastest growing world".
Coordinator Michael "Monty" based on the Widenius MariaDB's product does not pay users anything, and it can develop through the web any forward software.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paid customers.
With the help of data sources, the vast unknown remains in order and is readily available.
For example, if you use Links, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the form of a picture will come from the database, and images have been connected there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the leader of MariaDB's technology, is now sending about half of his time to code.
A man who makes fine hand protections should be involved in ensuring that the Internet works secretly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source code database together with Swedish Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the Sun technology company bought MySQL with billions of dollars, and a year later Oracle programmed it with 7.4 billion Sun.
When the Oracle trade took place, most of the MySQL developers announced their departure.
"They didn't want to do work for Oracle, who didn't give a guarantee of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already established a company at this stage, which began to develop from MariaDB.
He didn't want his life to die.
I hired a very good developer from Sun to make sure that the code's continuity is protected by the same friends who also created it.
Since MySQL is an open source code database, MariaDB was able to develop it itself.
I just had to change my name.
The establishment was founded on the freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"The assurances were not made during MySQL," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenikus and MySQL billionaires, the Finnish hardly knows anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years our growth rate has been about 50% per year," says MariaDB's economic leader Kenneth Paqval√©n.
The growth centre of MariaDB is still not winning, and Paqval√©n is a strong firm's recognition.
On the other hand, he reveals that, on the basis of the cost, MariaDB estimated its ability to obtain EUR 20 million in advance.
Since the information is free, the company has developed services around which companies are willing to pay.
MariaDB will also help in the exchange of data accounts, which may be over a year old if the client has used closed data.
The choice from MySQL to MariaDB will succeed at the moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telef√≥nica and Kaakkois-Asian largest bank DBS are MariaDB's customers.
The most recommended viewing services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud offer customers from MariaDB.
At the same time MariaDB will automatically extend to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems in which MariaDB has replaced MySQL for a long time.
Although we have a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers are among the world's largest television operators, gambling companies, banks and even some central bank," a list of Paqval√©n.
The data markets continue to govern wastes such as Oraclen, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in closed data markets.
Oracle also MySQL is not required to be compared to the company's traditional closed data base.
Although the largest data companies have lost their market share in recent years, such players as MariaDB in the business exchange are still undecided, despite rapid growth rates.
About $50 billion on the database market, the source code of open source data does not even reach billions.
However, the weight of open source code cannot be measured only in cash because most users do not pay any of these programmes.
The company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open data sets.
In addition, more than half of the old data should have been exchanged for the opening or transfer at least started at that time.
The same companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the following source code of openness.
This has led to the fact that the licence payments of commercial data exchanges have been approved in the past.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to do on a smaller customer basis," Widenius said.
As the exchange of closed data is difficult, most of the customers have lost their prices on an audio basis.
"I'm a lot of customers who find it really difficult to move because their old applications and others are locked in a database," says Widenius.
She still believes that the customer's size is going to be complete.
When licence fees rise each year, the customer will be transferred to the source code database later or later.
The price is 10-20 per cent earlier, and service is better, as the customer can easily switch to another location.
In addition, many companies are faced with major system changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange data software.
Last morning MariaDB received EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth fund ever granted to the Nordic countries of the EIB.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to pay more.
One reason for the EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
For example, the company has customers in the public sector in Britain and Germany.
In Europe, the public sector pays billions of euros annually for data collection.
"Many countries want to move to solutions to open source codes and use tax havens more effectively," Paqval√©n says.
Wideni is concerned about how money is being spent even in closed health care systems in Finland when the open systems are worse and not in the hands of one software company.
Some say that open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The Community will help and do what it cannot or cannot do.
At 55 years of age, Widenius belongs to another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds, including the most famous developer of open source code.
Widenius assists other companies in developing business operators on open source code.
I still need to talk 4-5 times a year about this issue in different parts of the world.
Italy encourages its approach to civil organisations' rescue vessels
Italy has warned civil organisations which rescue their ships from the Black Sea that they cannot continue their activities, unless they are committed to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If civil organisations fail to take a new approach, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities," said Interior Minister Marco Minnit, in a survey by the Toronto La Stampa.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities had secured the German Jugend Rettt's ship, which was suspected of cooperating with human rights activists who promoted immigration.
Only one year's aid organisation refused to comment on the specific charges of Ambrogio Cartosion.
"We must be able to save people, and we must be of the utmost importance. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to act in the area of search and rescue," the organization said in a social media opinion.
"We can assess the charges only after we have collected all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettt from the beginning of the organisation Juvetta since October.
There is no doubt that the crew had taken on board a ship that had been stolen directly from human carriers who were re-initiated.
One such case is claimed to be only a few kilometres from the border of Libya, and the information is disclosed from the complainant's document, which contains Italian information tools published.
The Commission suspects that the Italian border guard is in charge of rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Yuventa must be included in the Italian police monitoring the operation.
Only three of the nine national organisations involved in the search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Action Plan: Save Children and Maltian MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced that it was deemed necessary but acceptable to hold new rules as Torstana because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue operation of the organisation.
In a group of people who refuse to comply with the guidelines, Nobel laureate doctors are an organization without borders.
In response, it was stated that the number of rescue operations achieved by Italy has been estimated in recent weeks as evidenced by the measures taken to strengthen the Libyan border guard and to begin to produce results with local city leaders.
"In the last few days, light has begun to shine on the tunnel," the Minister said.
He pointed out that this month's plan will continue to discuss economic development projects with the Libyan city leaders, as well as measures with Chad, Niger and Mali, which can reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe.
The officer suspects his murder victim by Enonteki, suspects found from the country - a case to the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in the town of Enonteki last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish gunman.
It's been said before that both of them were retired workers.
The police have been so old to tell us that suspects would have been stuck in the ground with two dogs after their creation.
A man was found buried in the ground, and he didn't resist when caught.
The case has to be raised within a week.
The case may be handled in the Court of Justice of the Lap during the course of August.
Harry Potter and all my friends, Robert Hardy, are dead.
British actor Robert Hardy died at 91 years of age.
The displayman's death was reported by this family as Torstana.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his performance career at 24 years of age in theatre.
During his long career, he also showed up in movies and television.
Hardy is especially reminded of the role of Prime Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter's paintings and the animal rights of my friend James Herriot's book on TV.
The BBC's recommended series was described through all seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to life imprisonment for committing suicide
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for textiles and telephones that she was thought to have committed suicide by her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, spends 15 months in prison and five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. His boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide 13.7.2014.
"My family's upset," said Conrad's father at the Torstan sitting.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change in court and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed free of charge.
He was threatened by a 20-year trial, but according to his experts, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in a red suit and a black coat, listened to his trial hand in the cross of a crying test on the ground.
"His act killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided to improve Conrad's life for himself.
He hasn't taken responsibility for it," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any cover."
According to Carter's case, the case led to "the disturbing conditions that Carter is seriously affected".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter was not "in the field or in the field of fitness and not even in mental health problems had a significant impact on his performance".
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's Lynn Roy's opinion, where her mother said that "it wouldn't take a day for me to die my dear son to die.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this. I am trying my best to comfort his sister in this feeling that we are always going to bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she thought she'd never come to see her brother naked and not be a mother to her children.
"It's hard to miss a man who's been in my life every day since I was born.
The case appears to be a future pre-accession event, as there is no law in the State of Massachusetts which would have been a crime to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car crash in 2014.
The incident aroused Kingdom interest when it became evident that Carter had been involved in his essays to persuade his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Get up, get up, get out of here, get out of here. I don't know, there's a lot of killings," Carter wrote in a lot of messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was at that time happy with his family.
Just before Roy committed suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start a generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for Roy's death, and the judge said that Carter could not benefit from the case by offering questions.
The event has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of them is Amanda Knox, 30, who was sentenced to death by her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion statement, where he says: "Michelle Carter needs help and help, not prison."
Secretary-General Nato: Russia's worst then cold war
The military union between Naton and Russia has clearly been in the wrong place, commenting by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as Tortina.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that Naton's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg identified CNN's challenge.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and Russia in the region of East Ukraine, Nato‚Äôs relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly due to its continued instability.
According to Stoltenberg, however, Nato has still been committed to acting so that the enthusiasm would not cross his mind.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the deterioration of the situation and the new cold war.
Prior to the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump in the United States refused to prove that the idea of America and Russia was even at a dangerous level.
Trump called for the gratitude of the worst-case conventions in the countries that had adopted new commitments against Russia last week.
The audit will change 850 000 diesel engine due to the experience of car manufacturers
The day before the audit announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 cars.
BMW‚Äôs leader said that it believed that "there are more reasonable options than investments", he referred to European cities, including the BMW municipality in Munich, which consider limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler reported on changes made to more than three million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a return call.
European car manufacturers have made strong use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the objectives of CO2 emissions.
The typical emissions of diesel engines are considered to be the resulting food and asthma.
Emissions increase the installation costs of neutro-powered devices where the vehicle is difficult to estimate competitively.
The German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been charged with the causalisation and side-by-side of major car companies.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cars that reduced emissions in accordance with the rules. Usually, the emissions were larger.
Several accusations have been raised against the leaders of Volkswagen in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the last month, the former thermodynamic leader of the Aud Motor Development Section was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so he can be granted permission to the United States for legal proceedings.
Earlier this year, the audit was conducted in the Volkswagen crime investigation.The authorities doubted that the audit had set up a system that could reverse European emission requirements.
The audit study can significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the majority of Volkswagen's winnings are relatively large.
The vote of Venezuela started with a volleyball study, with large opinions in favour
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented company of opinion that has no role in the election, the president of the National Electoral Council, Tibisay Lucena told the suppliers.
Maduro ensures the end of the crisis
In Venezuela, a representative was elected on Sunday in a controversial vote, which is intended to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organized opinions against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has cast its own opinions so that they would be on the way to launch.
According to El Pais, the national security teams of the country began to take on local time on Wednesday to take care of the country's Parliament building.
Groups are intended to ensure the safety of the designation.
Climate change in the province of Provence lavender
Lavendelist has become a symbol of the South-West France Provence region, but now it threatens climate change.
Lavenal has been reduced because of the benefits of drought and drought. Researchers and farmers are trying hard to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavenal is a very dangerous region of Provence because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, resulting in a clear reduction in the percentages of drought and in particular,‚Äù says Dr. Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence, located in Provence.
"This will reduce the life of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought to the region a lot of smallpox that spread microbacterials."
The pancakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts passengers, and it is also very desirable in the area of freshwater and cosmetics.
"Instead of the stars and great flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or lacking in total," Chaisse says.
"In other words, the parts containing ether oil are less than that."
Rating is sought by increasing the pressure by slowing down the soil density and by spraying the plant with a protective layer of sand and water. In addition, moisture is developed in more sustainable forms.
The killer's murder appears to be a growing threat in Mexico
The release of the Riodace newspaper once a week usually takes place on Wednesday to discuss how the most recent cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities, and finally drug abuse in the State of Sinaloa are dealt with.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of a recent tragedy.
Operators are invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers discuss which is safer: leaving the children home or taking them into custody in 2009 at the Granati-sik.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the room's front desk: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking for the names of the suppliers in each group, and there's no need for evidence, findings and feelings.
The table lists the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and suppliers who are suspected of being paid by government or drug cartels. They are criminals who make it dangerous for Mexico to rehabilitate.
According to the Committee on Defence, at least 25 suppliers have been killed after President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto officially arrived in December 2012. The protection of the United States has 589 attacks and threats. In the past year, at least seven suppliers have been killed in seven countries.
The last victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodocen, supplier and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a supplier," Valdez wrote together many of his books on drugs.
He is taken seriously even though he is everywhere. The publicity of the Riodoce building hides a large picture where Valdez looks like a central order. The picture reads: "Right". Three-pound suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that warm Valdez‚Äôs smiley plants. Valdez has eyeglasses and brands that are designed for good purposes.
The meeting is held less than two months after the death of Valdez. The participants discuss their common trauma, stress, sleeplessness and fear of injury.
In 2010, a case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case case-by-case investigation was established.
The perpetrators are only rarely subject to the law, as is the case with thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders only rarely decide to deal with the law.
riodoce‚Äôs suppliers are going to continue writing about Sinaloa‚Äôs violence, even though they are dying and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety meeting is only a little useful because the killers are not aware and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is a very long time ago," she says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez was removed from Riodoce's delivery in the capital city of the state in Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had been walking in red Toyota on just a couple of cards when two men stopped him and pushed him out of his car and shot him out of two. The number is probably associated with the name of the paper: Riodace means twenty-one.
The gun went out of Valdez's car and took it off one trip.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two grown children.
The storms move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
But I'm afraid I'm dying to be a knight.
The Sinaloa has been the most bloodiest battle in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and tortured in January to the United States. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
In the streets of there, someone or several people are shot daily as dead, and in the land of graves there are corrosive double graveyards that are larger than many homes.
In the country on the coast, only one cartel manages ports and drug trafficking in the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of his work as a leader and leader of Riodoce, at the age of 60 Ismail Bojorquez felt guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodace published the Damasso Lopez challenge, leading a competitive group that is going to fight against Guzman's sons.
The case may have been caused by the sons of Guzman: your suspect customers bought each issue immediately when the paper came to the sales offices.
Another error was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after the second press release of the same case had to be attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a turning point in the violence against suppliers.
He had made it clear to so many that his friend and fellow man were no longer able to fear him.
He had made a long stay in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce.
In Sinaloa "it was impossible to make journalism a problem of drugs," Bojorquez says.
Over the course of time, the paper began to feel courageous and honest, and its sales and reputations grew.
The editors appreciated the opportunity of public journalism to study hard-of-the-art journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers included in the paper stories that no one else believed in.
Eight years after his establishment, Riodace won the refurbishment of Maria Moors Cabot‚Äôs prize in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was given the award of international freedom of the press to the Committee for the Protection of Suppliers in order to be able to follow the history of Mexico's drug trade without delay.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," she said when she received a reward from the Committee of Trustees.
The drug trade is in Sinaloa "life-threatening", Valdez said Rompevinto on the TV challenge last October.
"The operator shall take the task of putting him down ‚Äì or show him a stupidity.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when I was born here - why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodocen's personality needs Valdezia ‚Äì a joker who beats like a porter. They want a friend who always gets a wish and advice. They want a teacher who knows how to survive.
They created his routines.
He always used to get drunk.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were going to his destination.
The death of a colleague has also given them a basis for how they can best do their work and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it when we deal with their wives and children and their clean business practices, their secret drug trade thanks.
They were left outside of the story," Bojorquez says.
That meant, in the best case, strong self-sensitivity and self-defence,
confidence in your own medicines.
If you feel that everything isn't right, you need to stay away.
The problem is, according to riodoce's supplier Andres Villarrea, that "the effect can be misleading, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules are no longer in Sinaloa, nor are they in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros and other countries where there are dangerous networks: attractive secretarial courts, weak offices and corrupt authorities.
The functioning environment is constantly changing.
A few days earlier, it had been shown that the insurance programmes for sale to governments had only been followed by activists and suppliers in Mexico.
Two police officers outside the building had been asked to protect their wooden roof from a 40-stage fence.
The Government of the State had designated them to guard the supply facilities of Riodoce located in the four-storey building in the central Curiacan region.
Some of the suppliers considered that these two police officers belonged to a group of 50 per cent whom the government of the country did not consider to be reliable.
It had been months since the suppliers had been on drug routes in the mountainous region.
This week's number of Riodoce's delivery was scheduled for three heads.
Julio Cesar Chavez‚Äôs brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper was also intended to reveal that the government‚Äôs use of money had focused on the government‚Äôs home city.
In addition, in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, only at the entrance of the prosecutor's office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official information on who had been infected and how, therefore, it was necessary to proceed with caution: all in the cities knew that the restaurant was in the hands of both drug dealers and authorities.
The operator found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered on behalf of an institutional government party (PRI). The PRI has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for nearly a century.
Government officials who are involved have recently been accused of corruption in many cases of public corruption.
Villarreal asked the supplier to write about previous cases at the same location. In some cases, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman succeeded in getting away and avoiding the army race.
A few months earlier, readers would have known from Valdez‚Äôs column that they had obtained reliable information about rape.
"We'd already know what's happened before," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received care for her body structure because of her fine name "El Flaco", Ouunain.
"Now all the contacts we're supposed to have are different."
Valdez's working room has been converted into a warehouse where the suppliers' penalty is kept in contraventions and charges. Light workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become journalists.
Actor Miriam Ramirez said that the next morning on his way to the representative of the local prosecutor‚Äôs office, who was again responsible for the murder of the new supplier.
Salvador Adame died three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoacan.
After his death, he was found in a burned body based on the DNA tests performed by the authorities by Adame.
Operators have started to protest more and more voices throughout the country. The "SOS Press" texts appear on the opinions expressed in opinions and buildings.
Today, President Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the case of Valdez.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of keeping and killing the suppliers because they repeated the truth.
He has then asked that he be removed from government matters because he is concerned that he cannot hate being objective.
Valdez has repeatedly confirmed that the suppliers in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, allowable authorities and an uninterrupted society.
Finally, in its last book, Narko√±ornalism Valdez writes that drug dealers kill suppliers, but they are also killed by the order of political and security groups with the crime in common.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks by suppliers last year were due to police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are delayed by killing," Ramirez says.
I'm afraid it's gonna have to work.
No one forgets blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in the northern state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writings."
His head pulled away from his head, there were computer clicks and sounds.
Some of the newspapers have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, a letter exchanger in the northern state of Chihuahua after the March murder of Miroslava Breachin.
Some of its activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Mana, continue, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez first published a message to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the suppliers have descended from their countries or from all countries.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find a job in the country, and the whole time must be on guard.
Sometimes the criminals were looking for the supplier‚Äôs hands, as the photographer apparently went to Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in the apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had returned from Veracruziz.
For those who continue their work, each day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a waitress at any time, admits that writing about drug trafficking is frightening.
"I became a supplier because Mexico's on its way to hell," she says.
Some time later, Riodocen‚Äôs suppliers sat at midnight in front of the delivery using their feet when the new number was ready. Perhaps their phone began to be a sign of the message.
Between the rival gangs and the security forces, 19 people were killed at the airport of Mazatlan.
The war was as fast as was promised in the messages of the folder found in the area.
The operators set up a new Riodoce website using their mobile phone.
The first one was to be set up as a new one the next day.
The Sirenes fought in the vicinity ‚Äì again a new gunpoint.
Bojorquez would charge police officers for delivery:
If they were scared, they'd hide it very well.
Riodocen‚Äôs delivery continued from the background of the murdered founder of the paper under this massive image, where the man appears to be central to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that he can't even consider ending the operation. "How can I stop the paper when our coach asked you to leave the street to talk about the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project began with a great return - "Good place"
In April 39 years, Hannu Mannise‚Äôs celebrations were short, as the professional pilot began to prepare for the Olympics.
However, your exercise began in a catastrophic way when Manninnen became ill with flu.
This began a long period of illness, which lasted about five weeks.
In May I went into practice with my whole disease.
At first it was a fluffy and finally a childhood like a substitute that I had to eat on an antibiotic.
I was able to do only ten percent of planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been sick for so long.
It was a hard place when I didn't get a useful exercise, Manninen told the night Sanomi.
Testimonials to be broken
On the second week of June 2007, the World Championship was conducted by the World Championship Research Centre for KIHU on 12 June.
In the test, the player is moving in a wheelchair at a speed of up to three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat will stop for about ten seconds, and the tester will take off the player‚Äôs neck with a needle to the milky acid sample.
I spent the last time on the floor for 32 minutes, but now I've only stayed for 28 minutes.
He came up against her. Mannine's telling me.
Best Destination
After the beginnings, Manninen will tell her how to stay healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises in which I have tried to normalize the metabolism of the substance.
It's a good five-week time back now.
The guide was also a half-week vacation from the airport.
I'm going to walk with my family this morning, too.
In the last few years, Manninen has only participated in four world-level competitions before the Lahden MM houses.
The best result was seen in the opening contest immediately when Manninnen rose at the top of the 18th century.
Directional guidelines
For the first time until February, the major producer of the mining and mining group, Peter Kukkonen, has made a long-term training and competition plan.
Now we're going to get different cuts compared to the last time we've been doing this.
After the first kiss, Ruka would have a three-week World Cup weekend.
In July, the goal would be to be with at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsa.
By the end of January, we should still be involved in the plans at Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, a name will be found on the list of Olympics, says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth summer Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the gold of Salt Lake City in the 2002 group competition has celebrated a number of alibi.
Dinosaur was protected by his hostile namination
At first, it looks like a terrible fight.
Now researchers have discovered the first results of finding Canadian coal miners from the whole being that had been so well preserved that experts called it Mona Addis Ababa.
It had been so well preserved that researchers could even determine that its skin was red and it had been "distracted past".
According to Current Biology, it has been the best preserved in all ages of history as well as the best kind of representatives of the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodo-threat, which is 110 to 112 million years ago in the mean phases of the Union.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossils to be truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic page, the species is one of the most preserved fossils of all ages.
It was found at Suncor Millenium, North Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011, and was found by Shawn Funk, a miner.
He found something that did not seem to be a natural part of the environment of love, and he decided to investigate his findings more accurately.
Fossil found from the rocks was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyre.
There, a hole was dug for six years from a hole in the ground for about a hundred miles [1,100 km].
The results of the hard work are now available.
"If you move your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher in the royal museum of Tyrell.
"It is one of the most beautiful and most durable dinosaurs in history.
In recent studies, meat-eated dinosaurs have found that there was a likely significant threat to this growing meal, even though it had a pansarium and it reminded the walking pansarium.
Its red-white pans contain its natives, and it also protects it from darker and more choice color, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to combine its environment and avoid its enemies, greater dinosaurs.
110 million years old nostalgia rose to search in May, and it is now shown in the Royal Palontology Museum of Tyre.
Researchers have given it their name, Borealoppelta markmitchelli, by museologist Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was a team who spent over 7,000 hours on the scene of the dinosaur.
The nostalgia has remained so amazing that Mitchell and the international research team have been able to determine its body's shape and shape.
They found that it was still a common color in the animal world where the body is darker and more selective.
Nevertheless, the discovery was surprising because Borealopel has a significantly higher number than the present animals with a corresponding color.
This may lead to the conclusion that meat-eated dinosaurs were fed to the extent that evolution preferred as a means of survival instead of hiding from the war.
Modern animals, for example, have a similar color. They are much smaller and therefore easier islands, which indicate that the nodo-urban was seriously endangered.
"Great, strong, pansarad dinosaurium poisoning tells us how dangerous the union dinosaurs were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the bone marrow of the nodo-urticaria reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists continue to study the nodograssus so that they can draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its cell so that they can find out what it ate in the last atrium.
Researchers believe that it fell by the time it died, and thought about the sea, where it landed on that seabed.
At that time, Albert had the same temperature as today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were probably much longer than they are today.
"This nodulus is really important because its fragrant skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in the original form three times," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as the old one.
It doesn't require a lot of imagination: if you move your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The compound was a period of time of eaten dinosals of the therapist, powerful two-footed, meat.
Although their king, Tyranosaurus rex, millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors have been able to defeat this heavily protected dinosaur.
For example, Tyranosaurus was one of the predecessors of the Rex, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11.5% long six-hour earthquake.
The latest findings of nodo-survivors have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealopelta was attacked after her death and mutilated.
It was found at Suncor Millenium, North Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011, and was found by Shawn Funk, a miner.
According to the museum, it has been the world‚Äôs best retainer of fine-grained dinosour from the skin and the panserene to the bottom.
The nodules were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds [1,300 kg].
On their boats you got two semi-trailers.
Researchers believe that this leanly-funged plant has walked through the present West Canada until someone drove it to the open sea.
Its belt has been kept in small details since the seabed.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains still in the thick layers of the pansary.
Michael Greshko also wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "one of the rarest as a lotus disease.
The more you see it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still a fossilized skin in the leaves of its calvopanssar.
It's the right front. It's in the back.
I can also count on the fingers of its leg head."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who are the losers?
Brittany Ferrell was severely beaten 9.8.2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from St. Louis's village and sat on his arbnb apartment on his cell phone.
Then he noticed a message from his locker.
"The police killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the way."
Amazingly, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information about his food, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In his time there were numerous new offers from user @TheePharoah.
The user's name belongs to the peasants living in St. Louis, who tweeted in reality about Michael Brown's death. The white police had fired an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in the state of Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he came back to Twitter later that same night, people were told to pick up Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police's closets and screaming people, as well as the Brown's father, who claimed himself to be a man who was wearing a mask, including: "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police were standing in front of the interested dog.
He's also telling me about a video where the other police beat his leg and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers his truth.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've been used to and it could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry, and I was angry."
He stole the flight home the next day.
The plane dropped by one night. Ferrell went looking for his six-year-old daughter to trust her father and decided they'd go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years has been produced in the documentaries "Whose Streets?". It was first published in the film characteristics 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of relief and interest, love and loss, as well as the strength and simplicity of the local people who have gone to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to the Fergusonia flower shop and with his daughter dressed in the crown, they went back to the discussion about "How to live as black and where". They had talked about things countless stories before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for things they believe?" Ferrell recalls saying to her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
"I couldn't have been without my daughter," Ferrell later told me.
"The events of this day are... the culmination of events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow it.
He must be prepared to activise and organize, but he must also recognize as a black person the different stories and circumstances of the experience of living, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Although I've been able to protect him from racial prejudice, he's still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station, which became an activist camp when they waited for the case to be handled and finally found out that the police would not be charged.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local businessman who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches and shared them with interested people.
Ferrell gradually began to treat activists in a new way.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," she says. At the University of Missouri in St. Louis Ferrell, he was the president of the charity organisation of the minority. He then focused on the right to food and health in the black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just happened anyway."
A week later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the painter Lucas Alvarado-Farr "just listened to the story" what was going on.
Ferrelli's mind is very suspicious. He asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for good?"
As a result of doubt, they were countless times when people in the local community appeared, usually white, who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and weaknesses.
"We had heard that there was no common voice in Ferguson born and raised," Folayan later said in the challenge. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, who is known to be active in the prison of several prisoners who have been sentenced to death.
Davis's partner got Ferrelli on his way to the project together with six other locals. The photo group followed the events of Brown's bombings in the following years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," says Davis.
"I had the most important thing to do with how local people are presented in the film because I'm presented the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experiences, since it was intended to show that the nation 'is not a charismatic leader but a community'.
That is why the document shows an amazing private part of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage.
"I took my time undercover," Ferrell laughed when he told me how he felt when he saw the movie for the first time.
"But I understand that this work and the human painting of the blacks require certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story is repeated and brings back to the middle of a wide range of black quair women's role in the Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black boy, Trayvov Martin in 2012. Two of the three founding members of the movement are associated with the quair identity.
"The leadership of the black quair women has kept the whole movement on it," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to keep fighting with a lot of tension.
The black queens have had to endure everything."
Folayan has the same idea: "True black women, who have a lot of queer women, are really uplifting."
However, he points out that Ferrelli was not selected for the document "intendedly" because of his quair identity.
"He got energy to move," Folayan says.
"There is no shame, however, that he was in the first place. Black Queen women live in many places of entertainment, and they have a lot of games.
His energy depends on the white stone."
News groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but there are still tensions between the Community and the police.
Ferrell's got two and a half years left, and she got a trial to support the engines in her opinion.
His description of the social political climate in his home country is short and imaginative: "Secret".
Still, he still trusts the school that he learned out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our will is to fight our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only destroy our possessions."
Suitable compatibility: artist creates images from Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are central exhibition halls ‚Äì white, black, and raw plants that can be seen as more closely as possible as possible.
These 30 works are artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg's drawings based on Chelsea Manning's post and hair DNA samples.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served 35 years in court. Manning was sentenced to the release of diplomatic electricity classified under the WikiLeaks page.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened 2.8.2017.
The result is a two-year correspondence exchange between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a translucent and controversial fellow thinker who is committed to the prison commission Barack Obama's love for his office on the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 forms based on his genetic data. They are necessary, however, to provide a little theoretical basis for the formation of DNA data, misunderstandings and interpretations of causes and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in the name of Bradley Edward, has been openly told that he has been married to women from the same age. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including rape, computer theft and theft.
There was only one picture of the prison‚Äôs trial of Manning: a construction, black selfie, where a troubled manning sits in the driver‚Äôs seat. He has access to a platinum suit that came from his identification.
Dewey-Hagborg had received a major recommendation in 2015 on the Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
There he created images on the basis of criminal technical information. He got DNA information from cigarette smokers and pipes, and he created pictures of what people could have seen in this regard.
Then the artist received an e-mail from the paper Magazine.
"They challenged Chelsea Manning and needed a picture," Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition in the media.
You couldn't go to Manning's house and you couldn't picture him in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she'd like to make Manning's DNA.
The artist and his work in the museum were surprised by the exchange of letters. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a printed picture of the movie that was described by Shoil Kanungo. It described the future in which the President would have liked Chelsea's trial and he would be able to look at the exhibition.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning‚Äôs trial just a few days after the release of a series of photographs. It was successful in attacking the seven-year branch of the national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump goes to his own war against intelligence and transsexual soldiers, and he is still looking for new ways in Twitter to strengthen the powerful two-times he was supposed to slow down in fact.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all has its purpose."
The gallery wall has an artist's opinion and under it Manning's great title, where the stage of sex i is in the heart. In the resolution, the artist called for the end of "the automatic division of sex, sex, sex and culture which is based on sex, sex and culture".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA period: a long line of C-, G- and A-books written by the lithium.
This 200 books ‚Äì or nucleotide, like the scientific definition used by an artist ‚Äì together with Dewey-Hagborg, wants to find out how much we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my show helps people to understand that we are genetically equivalent and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also shows his Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, there are 30 of them here."
The last job of the exhibition is in its own room: page Manning and Dewey-Hagburg series.
That's where Manning's ghost is buried in prison like King Kong, with megaphone.
"If they get you late, they've won," says the picture.
"Never be hard."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It must have so much effect that I can still get cold colors."
As described in the series paper, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes to the scene, he was greeted by the plants based on his own genetic information as a group of fans in the middle of the exhibition.
It is significant, as is all other in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA period has been written by a lithium high which is equal to its length (157.5 cm).
"The rebels were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring them to the people's attention," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe Chelsea's birth of a group that was also behind her release."
Professor of the Northwestern University and staff of Oxford University are looking for suspects of murder
The police tell them that they have started their national research to find a professor at the Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University who suspects that a man's rape will die in a Chicago folklore.
The documents of the Cooke District Court show that the arrest warrants were issued on Monday for Wyndham Lathemi, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, which are suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being beaten several times.
According to local information published by the Chicago Police Agency, the body was found 27.7.2017.
The police who were alarmed at the Grand Plaza room building found a victim who had several surgeries in her body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and was investigated for murder. The police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Mr. Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Minister for Social Relations of the University, stated by sending an e-mail that Lathem is now a state-of-the-art and has been denied access to the campuses of the Northwestern University.
"This is crimes committed by the authorities, and the Northwestern University helps research," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as an assistant to financial management at Oxford University.
In the opinion of the Universities and Somerville College, the Commissioner's e-mail says that "we have been in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to assist the US research authorities in any way possible."
In addition, the opinion said that Warren's colleagues were disappointed and hoped he would give up.
The head of the Chicago police station, Anthony Guglielmi, said he was calling on the authorities to give serious attention to the suspects.
"The police have been dealing with their place of origin, and we are continuing our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, the local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received unprecedented guidance that something happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as a scary place.
According to Guglielm, it's unclear whether the victim was killed the same day or before.
He told the security officers that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza team would publish to the population the following information: "Police should find out the course of events at the best possible time and the possibility of the victim as well as possible motivations, as well as the possibility of domestic violence."
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic," the judge told the police.
Moffatt must perform one hundred hours of unpaid social service.
At 39 years of age, a man was sentenced to the threat of an Islamic writing trade in London and "killing all Muslims".
According to the Independent paper, David Moffatt was sentenced to other forms of torture.
According to the police, the accounting staff warned them on 23 May.
According to the personality of the man, he was "an attempt to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police on a threat.
The threat did not relate to the incident in the book trade.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had been dressed in the same apartment as the suspect of the events of the book trade, the police prosecutor said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in the hearings.
A man should be paid a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, or about EUR 690 for legal costs and 85 pounds, or about EUR 95 for victims.
According to the Scotland Yard informant, a number of viruses are left unreported.
"Recent actions under the WADA road map in the near future" ‚Äì Russian Minister of Finance Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon take action in accordance with the WADA roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which can restore Russia's RUSADA powers.
"Some of the measures under the timetable have already been implemented, and RUSADA has received the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD Anti-Doping Office.
WADA's schedule has been updated from these parts," Mutko said as a torrent.
The Minister of Finance commented on the second part of the WADA road map setting out the conditions for the return of RUSADAN‚Äôs powers. The second part of the roadmap was recently published on the organisation‚Äôs website.
I think it doesn't have anything to worry about Russia.
"All has been declared and all will be fulfilled.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one point of the road map requires the Russian Antidoping Authorities to publicly accept the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren's study of WADA.
Mutko said: "The research is underway because our anti-doping system has given rise to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we can't afford what wasn't there."
In the words of Mutko, there were all of them on the opinion of Vitaly Smirno, president of the Russian National Anti-Doping Company.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov spoke to the Russian RSport Music Media, saying that there were problems in Russian anti-doping. "We have said several times that there are conflicting conditions and rules in the report.
We are not going to accept the report on the proposal," but he added.
WADA decided to terminate the doping control in Russia in November 2015 when the scope of the doping channel was revealed.
However, it was approved by the end of June by planning and coordinating the test under the supervision of international experts and UNDAF.
WADA's leader, Olivier Niggli, visited the RUSSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the trial, he indicated that the organization was "on the right way" towards the return of powers.
The British Association for Sceptical Love for Finnish Innovation: "No Show" on the health benefits of Mother packages
The British organization doubts the benefits of the Finnish Motherhood Packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardians claim that the Lullaby Trust organization fighting the death penalty prohibits the use of its own presentations in the Mother‚Äôs packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternal packages to all pregnant women is initiated in Scotland this month.
The package is also distributed in certain regions of England.
According to Lullahby Trust, there is no indication that the mother pack would reduce the risk of death.
It means a baby's unexplained emergency.
Lullahby Trust works as a health professional in Britain in the field of child safety.
We no longer allow our official presentations to be packaged because it should be understood that we recommend this product, the organization has informed us.
In Finland there is one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two dead thousands of births.
According to Lullaby Trust, the good reading of Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage girls.
The fact that each family will be given a table there may be one factor.
However, this cannot be said for sure, the delivery director of Lullahby Trust said Francine Bates.
We are concerned that maternal packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and mortality.
Mother‚Äôs package is a Finnish invention and it has been granted to all mothers in Finland for 80 years free.
The package contains various requirements, such as baby clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the pack.
The package itself is a nightmare where children can be taken to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, all its major products meet all safety standards.
For the sake of Lullahby Trust, it says that there is no safety standard for the homeless at the sleeping site.
According to Lullahby Trustin, the package can be the best option as a sleeping place if there is no application or floor covering available.
The order recommends that you use the package only for days and stop using it at a time when the child can turn around.
The order also recommends keeping pets away from packaging and ensuring that it is not broken or damaged.
I don't know what you're looking for. I'm sorry.
The crew of the Japanese animal race is looking for a career in competition.
The left-wing crew has been surprised at the speed of the crew and has already taken care of the recovery within two weeks.
The competition took place in Okayama, Western Japan, on the night of the game.
The security officers revealed that the area had been removed from the zoo by means of an escape.
It doesn't die right now because it's eating the food around the zoo, but we're very worried, says Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
At 35 years of age, Karanut is a neighboring village, 55 kilometers and about a foot long.
Yamane describes the karkure as quiet and lovely.
During the opening hours, the area will be free of charge.
The animal feed has not been received by viewers from the competition.
The last one of the women was hit in the second week.
Yamane found a way to walk a carker about 150 metres from the zoo.
I saw it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleague for help.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the workers in their network business start-up, but questions did not work.
Responses were often unreasonable, useless or even misleading.
Although he made sure that the questions were anonymous, some of the workers treated them unfairly.
"Question has not simply been consistent and objective," Errett says. As the company of his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on online sales. The company has 75 employees.
Erret decided to protect himself from outside help.
The market has become more and more new-type start-up companies that help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license programmes that can measure the commitment of workers; companies can ask questions and address them to certain groups and groups, as well as provide anonymous notification services to workers and, in some cases, directly to the government.
"Your own health can be followed by applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit come from?" asks Glint-based founder and supplier Jim Barnett in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure the commitment of employees.
Erret has been using Glint's software for three years, telling her that she has had a more profound view of the thoughts and feelings of her employees.
The program can make quick questions and votes for certain topics. It can also produce a map that can be seen with one eye, which is the most unsatisfied and which of the leaders has received the most weakest values. On this basis, Errett has been able to turn to the problem.
Entrepreneurships have understood that they must monitor job culture so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has died since the previous employer wrote about the culture in which workers are concerned and the punishment of problems.
For starters like Glint, such losses are an attractive business option.
The management, regulation and compliance of companies are a global industry which can rise to over $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent, located in the state of Colorado, is a startup that helps companies find and prevent unnecessary use. Interest toward the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a collapse.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It soon made a deal with Uber.
Glint's approach will allow companies to ask questions, collect answers confidently in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, workers may be notified of the unaccompanied use by a text message.
And if the leader is in doubt of the facts, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
"The public opinion has been voiced by the authorities," says Convercent's founder and provider Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or acts in an unfair manner, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities are not at all lacking in it. Consumers can begin to criticize the company, and it can also treat workers and become a challenger of justice.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant has over 25,000 employees at 500 clinics. The company has been using Convercentia over a year since it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily connected to the main account.
The previous practice was that if the employer wanted to report the problem, he had to first figure out the phone number or e-mail address he could make to the main notifying account, then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Lawyer James Vitrano. According to him, the complaints made by workers were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems remained hidden from the leaders working in another city or country. Now problems such as discrimination, anxiety and unfair wages can be detected and treated faster.
"I am getting more and more comprehensive about the reality of the workers," said Vitrano, who is leading the ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"In the same way, we will protect our shareholders from the legal procedures related to working relationships."
According to Quinlan, companies began to deal with the commitment of ethics, values and employees more closely after the investigation company Arthur Andersen took action in connection with the Enron scandal.
Only through the social media did companies understand that they could no longer prevent public information from coming to their destination.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly speeded up.
It is an acceptable business and opportunity for capital investors, as well as Glint and Convercent have support for capital investors.
On February 10 million dollars were collected from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has collected a total of 47 million dollars.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected a total of $60 million.
Investments are not surprising when the links between enterprises, business culture and venture capital are taken into account.
According to many studies, workers are expected to have more jobs.
In competition markets such as hidden activity, well-being and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a useful business.
"Employers are more committed to the success of the company if they are interested in the company and feel that they are listening to them and that their work is to be rewarded," says Nina McQueen, director of the LinkedIn company responsible for the remuneration and well-being of workers.
Investors will get the product when companies succeed, companies will succeed when employees commit.
The third party‚Äôs analytical tools allow for strengthening the commitment of employees, so it is not surprising that they are interested in investors.
It is important to know about the commitment of workers to work culture by experts,
but it is of no benefit if the measures are not implemented on the basis thereof.
If the company asks its employees to return, it may be considered to be a change.
And if the change is not rapid enough or there is no change, fraud can reduce employees' commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready for four thousand discussions," says Mr. Kotter International's Chief Executive, Mr. Russell Raath, who has seen too much confidence in companies just to collect information.
"If the company does not take action, workers will begin to wonder if they will be heard
And it doesn't matter what they think.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
As stated above, Madison Reed is currently making staff requests monthly and is able to handle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glintis.
When Erret was about to return to the decision-making process and the quality of the message, he was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that greater understanding will help improve their staff's sustainability over a long period of time, which is known for the great variety of workers.
"If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his undercover female genital mutilation, says the news agency TT.
A woman living in G√∂teborg had come home from the shower when she saw her window outside in a flash of smoke at the door.
According to the woman, the sound camera came into your apartment.
The woman who had been taken from the scene had been thrown into the other room.
When the woman was able to check the situation, she was feeling up first, but soon thereafter she was reassessed.
A 20-year-old man suspected of shooting has given his picture to women.
However, he claimed to paint only female plants.
The video described on the screen was removed, and the police had not been able to return it to evidence.
In the hearing, the man has given up his work, but refused to commit a crime.
In his illustration, the man had reason to say that he loves his neighbor ‚Äúas a fool. ‚Äù
According to the TT, the case is the case against the man.
Teachers need more support during the negotiations
Retirement cannot be lower than in export industry, but the difference should be slowed down, says OAJ President Olli Luukiane.
The temporary interruption of the public sector‚Äôs pensions emphasizes the difference, he notes.
We do not have the opportunity to make agreements that do not involve money laundering in any way.
Public contracts are only generated when private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of increases have been discovered.
For example, in January, it was announced that, for example, the OAJ's working conditions were agreed.
The interest rates have not yet been revealed.
He is also the president of the public-trained negotiating organisation Juko.
Infinity: The cash flow increases profit development lines
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that public sector employers‚Äô purchasing power is declining while private sector purchasing power is increasing.
According to the Section, a fixed-term cash flow will continue to reverse the thresholds.
In Finland, it is necessary to define how many students can be one teacher
In addition, the OAJ notes that the equality of basic doctrine must be ensured, as the differences between best and weak are growing throughout the period.
According to the order, education results are declining, and the gap between students and regions continues to grow.
The day of Brunsin's players lasted when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
The clock is soon private at night. A group of UCLA football players have left to talk about the campus's new training courses on another level.
Some of them have gone mad at their playmates, and they're going to turn their lights off after the first day of the exercise show.
The time for many of them to have this conversation for a few minutes is the average day.
The next morning, after three hours of practice, the players at the high school will return to the apartment to read the final exams.
"The next three days will come the borders of these guys," says writer Jim Mora a little before Monday's shift into Tuesday.
The university‚Äôs cover organization reduced the number of daily exercise records by two. The change was intended to ease the number of players‚Äô work, but it has continued to their days ‚Äì at least until the end of the final exams are held.
Thus, UCLA's first three exercises began for more than seven nights. The players had already had difficulty finding room.
Restricting the exercise schedules one day means that the exercise days are longer. Leir started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time Mora continued six through Westwood‚Äôs preparation period when exercises are held at the same time with summer courses.
Exercises are intended to be held 18 times before 20 August, when a major preparation takes place during the opening: UCLA will be held at Texas A&M University in September.
Mora claims to support NCAA's regulatory change, even though it has made players' time more difficult.
"We're really carrying them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But players are ready to do work. They're great friends.
I think it's going to be easier when we get to Sunday, and then we have more time.
UCLA closes exercises outside the line after the line. It is not easy to take into account a direct view of the exercise scene for the next stop area and the Luski Center, a high-level hotel that has already been bombed on top of the ground floor.
Bruins' players are going to change the hotel by weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise over time when rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"It's a matter of fact that people can store the room and picture the exercises there on video. It's not too much of a worry.
A lot of time is paid for the video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to worry about my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
In Central Africa, there are presidential elections in Rwanda on Friday, which are already clearly seen as the winner.
Paul Kagame has officially sought a third phase, but in practice he has been affected by the country‚Äôs leadership since 1994.
At that time, the master group of RPF ended up killing an experienced organisation.
We were in charge of the RPF.
The camaraderie has been assessed, inter alia, against harassment and restrictions on freedom of speech.
He has also been blamed for, for example, for misappropriating poverty statistics.
On the third floor, Kagamem will be able to reach out because the two long-term constitutional laws of the Presidency have been amended.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a well-known leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and the country has turned into international investments.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in the integration of the population of the divided country.
The success of food has led many Africans to wonder if liberalism is a true model for African countries.
However, the camaraderie has promised more freedom to the nation after the country has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fraud by improving the verification of facts
Facebook intends to send possible currencies to independent auditors and to present results under the original article. The world‚Äôs largest social network has announced it as a torrent.
The company would publish an opinion on its website, which will allow it to use up-to-date computing in the identification of currencies. Any currencies will be sent to the verifiers of the facts and the results will be published under the original article.
Facebook has been estimated to be the largest currency distributors. Many believe that the currency was affected by the US presidential election in 2016.
The issue has been raised in political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with ballots before May's presidential election and September's elections, Germany will support the plan to shut down social media networks if they do not quickly remove the content of hate.
Torstaina Facebook reported in a separate opinion in Germany that the examination of the facts is being carried out in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what the stories do not follow after independent observers. They also want more background information so they can decide what they read and share," wrote Sara Su in company blogs.
He added that Facebook will continue to test articles related to the subject and will make other changes to reduce currency flow.
The birth of a book: A history of a city
The small Scottney town of Kent is now known as the Skeezen Music Videos and Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has a backdrop of 700 years of mythical history. Now this amazing place of Bewlin is the subject of a series paper written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned book writer.
"It's great to be able to study the texts written over 300 years after the death of a person," Rhodes says very carefully.
"I feel personal contact when I keep a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells stories of families living in Scotland on average for a period of time. Each story has been described by various artists, promising British series director Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on the archives of Rhodes. In 2014, he was shown dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which were the documents of the British National Library. The project was known.
"I was moved to the kitchen in my note in the letter of the headlights. The letter was written to the divisional branches by two agents working in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his turn!
And the letters are coming from the sand, because at that time the light was used to come.
Three centuries later, the reader will be able to realize that he is on his own.
I love the architects!"
The author of the old documents was able to live in the city for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which felt too good to be true.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" city, architecture, architecture and rareness, such as the fine days on the wall, and the bottles on the wall in the centuries of rule.
He walked around the old city on the streets and on the floor and discussed with forest guards, woodworks, and sometimes artists.
In the evening, he said, "He's gone to whiskey and started writing."
The history of Scottney is almost unknown, since the city was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation by the last relative, Elizabeth Hussey, who died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the building staff was just starting through the archipelago. Rhodes describes that the architects had been held hundreds of years in the same method: by bringing everything extra to the outside.
In the archives there were journals, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned anything. "It could be thought that the Indians are weak," Rhodes says. "But on the other hand, the families lost even one hair.
I thought I shouldn't have been."
Some of the history of the book goes from the city to the history of England, such as The Laborer. It tells of a man who was involved soon after the city was completed in 1381.
"Nightly Families of Kent and Sussex states that the city had a mellow in 1380," Rhodes says.
"An English homeboy started in the same area, and it was thought that the cap could start from the mud.
Maybe these events are related to each other?"
Other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the city ‚Äî such as The Priest, a history of the priest who hid Darrell‚Äôs family for seven years during the religious cleansing of England.
The Smuggler also tells the story of the 1700th-century story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell. He is said to be buried by filling his own tomb with the stone of the ark (it was noticed years later when his tomb was opened).
Darrells are the family of Rhodes in Scotland. "The men of Perheen seem to have been pretty weird. They were constantly obliged to debt and bought things they wouldn't have had money.
The men of Darrell's family would solve their debt by going to the wedding with the elderly women. I see them as common friends who participated in gambling."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing tests.
He spent two weeks writing in Finland a series of articles about Life in the early 1900 ‚Äô s about the improvement that has just been made.
The city of Scottney has a special place in her heart.
"It was hard to get out of there," she says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this evil ship."
You left Russia the worst of the cold war ever.
The military union between Naton and Russia has clearly been in the wrong place, commenting by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as Tortina.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that Naton's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg identified CNN's challenge.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and Russia in the region of East Ukraine, Nato‚Äôs relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly due to its continued instability.
According to Stoltenberg, however, Nato has still been committed to acting so that the enthusiasm would not cross his mind.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the deterioration of the situation and the new cold war.
Prior to the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump in the United States refused to prove that the idea of America and Russia was even at a dangerous level.
Trump invited to thank the countries for the bad conventions that were adopted last week by Russia's new anti-Russia forces.
Vladimir Klitchko's end - recast against Anthony Joshua
The long-term heavy-duty world master Vladimir Klitchko will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitchko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
In the Atlantic Olympics, 1996 goldsmith Klitchko took a professional 69 times to win 64 prizes.
He was in charge of various MM models in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitchko destroyed his urine for the last two weeks.
Tyson Fury found him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitchko met with Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and disappeared after a storm took place in the spring of 11th.
Joshua and Klitchko were expected to meet in the new court in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitchko didn't find any motivation to take it.
I used to make a few weeks' decision to get enough distance from Wembleyn's interview, Klitshko told me when he informed me.
I've got everything I ever wanted from the amateur and professional projector, and now I want to start after the second season.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredible success in the harvest.
I'm very grateful for that.
Look at Klitchko's reasons for making a decision from the video.
Klitchko's manager Bernd B√∂nte informed me that the final decision was difficult for Klitchko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That's why this is definitely the right decision, B√∂nte said.
Klitshko has been in a match with Hayden Panetier, an American actor since 2009.
Paris has one child born in 2014 to the daughter of Kaya.
Klitchko is also the former world champion of the heavy line.
In 2008-12 the brothers managed the MMs of various associations at the same time.
The Finnish thinker meets the conditions: "Five files"
The male species Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer of the summer.
I have had problems with Nikkas.
The wind and the cold have been brought from a woman's file.
The situation in London's MM crisis is also uncertain.
I'm Nikanen talking about saving.
The conditions have been like this summer against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the wheel, but it was improbable that I didn't get even a few reasons to move properly, Nikkanen said after Innsbruck cheese.
I've been competing and practicing here how many times and I've never experienced one different wind in this place, Nikanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
Through this time, the hippie movement has been a real challenge when there have been such an endless wind in the exercises, Nikkanen pointed out in Kalevan's case.
She spoke to Torstana in London.
It's been a difficult time getting technical cash, whether it's cold or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been brought from the file.
There is no reason to waste energy in a bad situation.
He got his handshake 455 for MM guys.
There's been 445 out there.
It's not the same thing in London.
Must be a malt and wait for a better wind.
The aim is to exceed the peri-day in the 460 box.
Why don't you get to train outsiders?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I got the hippies and the technology.
I'm sure you should've done the same thing now.
It's normal to have access to the government to practice. Now the government has been closed.
What kind of beauty would it be?
Twenty-five degrees hot.
A little wind is going on as soon as it's clear.
Experienced ex-computer slammed politics On: "We don't have any resources now, and not for many years"
Despite the favourable climate of the economy, the Government of the G√ºha Sipil has to keep in mind and ensure that the government's budget is paid off in debt, warning the Ministry of State resources that budgets have been prepared for decades by Erkki Virtanen.
He doesn't think there's any money left.
In 2015, Virta was retired from Finland in the middle of the week.
The construction of the first year's budget is just beginning.
In recent years, proposals for two-way policies have been presented, including on the rise of pensions, the reduction of car tax and support for electric bicycles.
They almost repeat that the elections are beginning to be close because when ten percent of the state's budget is funded by additional funding, we have no savings now, and not for many years.
I've even been told the truth about the ransom when it's taken, Virtane told Yle.
The Virtane insisted that all debt is owed to children.
Virtasse has a long experience in the preparation of government budgets: in 1978 he started as the Secretary of Budgets in the Ministry of State and later worked as the Deputy Head of Budgets and Budgets of the Committee.
Finally, before leaving his retirement, he serves as a civil servant of the Ministry of Labour and Energy.
The Authority noted in its challenge that the economic growth of the three per cent now predicted is likely to be temporary.
All the forecasters estimated that this was the kid from which we are already going to the bottom of the first year, and Finland is expecting a one-percent increase of ten years.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules on the permanent residence permit, namely the Green Card, are being modified by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants by 50 000 per year, to meet the requirements of temporary workers and to limit family income.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President will support them.
There is a need to discuss the bill in two rooms of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxable money by changing the way in which permanent residence agreements are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce climate change and replace the current programme.
The applicants who benefit from the new search process, who have English and are able to live on their own and who have the skills we have to use," said Trump.
The half of the king of Denmark does not want to be buried with the king at the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In this picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret described in April.
Prince of Denmark Margareta, 77, and this side of Prince Henrik, 83, will not bury any more, will tell the Danish court.
Traditionally, government couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Court of Justice, the court will make a statement on Thursday.
According to the BT paper, this is why the princess's dissatisfaction with her role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the newsman of the morning, Lene Belleby, in his comment.
The prince‚Äôs decision not to bury him on the King‚Äôs throne is of course a consequence that he does not treat him as equal with his half.
According to the Court, the King had long been aware of his party's hope of the place of burial and understood the decision.
The car on the road: The car was coming on the motor vehicle
Tomm had a divorce party and two small children.
They have not been disappointed by an accident, but they will not receive any financial security if they are not targeted by the other party.
There was a storm at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Architect Keh√§ III from the construction site.
Vandal Tommi tells her family that she's been doing great things in the car accident.
Tommi, his wife, Riina, and two small children of the parish church were driving on the motorcycle toward Keimolanport, in the direction of H√§meenlinn.
A long white car that was driving the family's car to the Himeenlinv√§nn√§tt√§w√§h√§√§nn√§cken is going to be speeding up, Tommi tells us.
Without the car's moving, Tom would've come up with it.
I broke up and turned the car at the same time, and it went from hand to hand, Tommi tells me.
Your family's car hits you with a lot of speed to protect you.
The parents and the rear of two small children were not discouraged.
The second child is under the age of three, the second is under the age of three.
It must have been a good time when nothing happened to us.
No driver even walked over us, even though there was a rough road in the area.
An accident occurred about 17.20.
According to Tom, no one stopped by their class, and the family called the emergency center.
They got their own power out of the car.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue facility came to the scene, and the family unit was reviewed.
The car went to the parking lot.
Tommi tells him and the little ones on the deck, and they got some kind of help in buying the car a couple years ago.
Without the other car's information, Tom's family won't get any money from insurance.
That is why the family looks forward to discovering the car from the viewers, which makes it possible for the family to take refuge.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to bring the kids up and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
I don't know how we manage financially if we don't get caught up in this case, but we're still going to have to figure out every cent.
Tommi hopes that you've seen what happened or that some of them are in contact with the police.
The East New York police plant and the Central New Rescue plant confirm that they have had to work in an accident site on Tuesday evening.
Address and talk corrected at 21.15: Unlike the beginning of the story, another car did not come up with Tom, but it was time from the speed limit to the family car.
Lotta J√§ppis's guide presentation deals with human relations by means of the tumor - Self-explosioner is seen What?-theater in the evenings and on the afternoons
Lotta J√§ppinen, who's home from the train station, brings his lead to the theater What?.
A self-examination is a musical feature of the past human relations and inefficiency.
According to the leader Lot J√§ppis, it is still a good idea.
The subject will be dealt with by means of a tumor.
I don't think I'm going to be responsible for my bad feelings, he says.
According to J√§ppis, the run-up process is carried out by a long-term budget and by a large, young heart.
The name of the proposal is challenging what a person reveals himself when he comes to know a new person.
Is he gonna take some role in the field, or is he going to get another roof open?
The motion of the motion shall be accompanied by the fact and fiction.
He's been driving and dramatizing the show.
He's also responding to the lights.
The presentation is composed of the text of the Working Group and there is no objection to it.
The leader believes that even if the presentation is about young people's ideas, it speaks for everyone.
The poet emphasizes that the Enlightenment does not directly tell him about himself or the relationship of the working group.
Facts and fiction are inseparable.
I'm sure my world will take care of the presentation.
I don't think that human relations would be bad, but neither do I think that human relations, especially couples, would be a good condition.
Many Learn From Their Occults
J√§ppin believes that the Enlightenmenter restricts the age - old picture of young adults living in Finland.
He says that many people have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have been separated.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
There's no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The presentation shows Minea Long, Niklas Rout√©n and Otto Rokka.
The working group also belongs to the woodworker Ella Snellman.
The music deal is J√§ppis and Rokan.
Love of the theater burned in Kouvolo
Lotta J√§ppinen, 26, who lives in the village of Kouvola, is a director of the theatre at the University of Artiakatemi.
There's two years behind and another down there.
Injection into the theater has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The music classes have been an assistant in the Kouvola theatre and have been shown, among other things, at the University of Helsinki and the last in the City Theatre in Turkey.
The lead has become more and more interesting.
A suicide bomber got his first night in Helsinki last week at Narr's show.
In the future, about 45 minutes will also be presented in J√§ppis's school centre in Turkey.
Self-evidentist Kouvola What?-Theater 4.8 p.m. 19 p.m. and 5.8 p.m. 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympics won a year's bitter motocrossontality - cholera dispute
A few players in Finland are as powerful as Janne Lachtla.
At the time of the Summer Olympics, the world was surrounded by hundreds of days a year for a couple of years and struggled to dream of the Olympics.
The attack was carried out in 2002, but the Lattala movement continued.
He was a non-fatal trainer, as well as a new type tester.
There is no longer much movement on the earth that the chemical has not been tested at least once.
It's been motivated to practice.
There's always something new. Lachtla's gonna tell you.
Finally, one thing was to stop all the Lathal.
In 2014 Lattala suffered from motorcross accidents.
As a result, his neck was broken and both hands were broken.
I wasn't at work.
I've had my victims at my home this year, Lachtla says.
There was a bad luck on the floor.
He also admits that tonight he may have been part of the race.
At the moment, a wise person can hear from a stranger.
But you asked for boundaries.
It's just kind of so hard not to be too tired to endure.
After the accident, Lachtla had to be in a special situation.
His fast life ended like a wall.
Back then, it was a long time for me to break up as the prime minister of Japan's freestyle class.
In 2006, he began smoking immediately after his own urine was finished.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do anything, Lachtla tells me.
And during the preparation period, Lachtla often challenged her defenses in her chest and physical examinations.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally exhausted, so I didn't even know my own thoughts.
They're not even a couple.
It was a good place to be.
I really enjoyed it because I really got to be just once.
Compulsory boldness as the prime minister of Lachtlan Finland.
Without stopping, he'd be afraid he'd come back to the end.
It's easier to find places that have gone away than we can!
Without my accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed to rest so much.
The campaign began as a preparatory for the Finnish Freestyle era about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer escape for the crew.
I've lost my motorcycle to a freshball!
It went out of the baby right away.
At least I was seven hours on the day I was shot.
Although Lachtla has always been a superinnocent trainer himself, he does not need to be as prepared as he is.
I don't force everyone to become the same.
We have the opportunity to have our own personality and ways to become the best of the world.
Freesty has a free style, and the mental style has always been according to it, Lachtla says.
Sexyrobots are coming and we have to be careful.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robotics sector ‚Äì just when it became clear that 2017 could no longer change your mind.
Yes, I am.
Sexyrobots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5-10 years.
"We have to take a serious approach to the dissemination of sex robots," says Professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield, founder of the Foundation, and professor of robotics and engineering.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the rain and the type of the windshield.
"Sexerobots are delayed, but they are sold pretty much, and we're going to see them more later," said Sharkey in the press release.
The sexes have developed into powerful robots that have heat-sensitive silicone walls and artificial boundaries that remind you of man's use.
The user can also adjust his own thoughts from the color of his eyes to the shape and type and color of the eyelids.
Even more interesting is that robots have "personality" which allows Stepforord women to show off progressive liberationists.
Sex has been developed for robots with silicone.
For example, RealBotix-Rotix can adjust the user's mind, even as a dream.
The company's real company Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems from the market, Wild Wendy is an environmentalist and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts to the user's personality as fully as possible," the company's website states.
In other words, the robot likes the same stuff as the user.
There are also various ways of thinking:
It can be even tired, talkable or "in the wind".
There are many disturbing limitations in the generalization of sex robots. They replace healthy human relations, but it is even more dangerous for women to fight and live in direct pregnancy fantasies when the user approaches, for example, as a dream and responsive robot.
True Company is similar to the Roxxxy robotic vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator.
However, sex robots are not just fetish or new sex.
Their generalization and development tells us something more darker and deeper in our cultures: raising gender equality towards sexual relations, where fighting is one option in the other.
Of course, most men do not get sex-producing, and their recommendations are still marginal, even though the FRR report tells of their growing relationship.
However, marginal phenomena often take a lot of time away from the spirit.
And many start acting either strangely or maliciously when the markets give it permission.
It is not surprising that sex robots have begun to publicize while women's rights are threatened by various parts of the world, and in the White House is a president who has been committed to women's concerns.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattares) there is no alarming picture of its powerful image, such as pictures of torn bodies and out of dried eyes.
Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it feels like a wonderful short trip.
Sexyrobots are trying to make as many real women as possible (in terms of pornography) as technically possible.
Robotics want their skin to feel good and movements follow the best possible human movement.
However, their "personality" is far from reality.
The robot can't get out of the relationship or situation.
They do not have their own will or history ‚Äì nothing about self - determination or perfectionism is wrong.
They're happy servants.
Orjatarian.
Police suspect: Australia's two terrorists were designed, the group led by the head of Isis
The head of Isis led a group of Australians who were suspected of having a bomb taken to Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, my father's lead man had also sent to Sydney bomb buildings.
It was suspected that the bomb was intended to be taken to the airport on 15 July, but the company ceased prior to the security investigation.
The police don't tell us why the company stopped.
The other terrorist plan was to build a very colourful gas device and bring it to the public place, e.g. to the public vehicle.
Michael Phelan, Deputy Secretary of State of the Australian Federation, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Sunday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One man has been released free, but he also continues his discourses.
The good half of the trumpet?
Get Mitt Romney to look after her health.
Through the trumpet, it has already been repeated until it is too late that the strong two of the voters have also lost their families.
On Sunday and the day of thank-youdays, American dictionary councils taught how to act with the family members who were voting.
We all want our clean computer.
At the very least, there has been a stay of Trump's ability to unite families.
I'll tell you about this because this week I broke my neck this week in New York, and she's a left-wing racer in Chicago, who's been having sex with our sex with the Republicans for a long time.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful, united effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, everyone knows me ‚Äì including the Republicans who have been fighting politics for decades ‚Äì are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
It's a good thing at dinner, but the more we think about it, the more important risks are involved.
Trump has given the left hand a new power, but the negative impact of his presidency can in fact bring us all to justice.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer threaten his attacks.
In the long term, there is even more shocking possibility that Trump normalizes the republicans of the right kind, which, like Trump, seem to have an immediate effect on understanding.
I remember the late version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog's car's cat, 14 percent income tax (and his tax report we've already seen). Compared to the trumpet, they are affected by very mild infringements.
When the trumpet is over, the next presidential committee of the Republicans needs to be very clear, and it feels immediately about the improvement.
When my baby was on my way to my home, we took our children to the Central Forest Corps, which is New York's largest and most expensive forest in New York, which is worth three dollars without caffeine.
The horses are powerful, medium-sized drums ‚Äì the winged clowns and the animals that look back ‚Äì are evil, and the competitive music that comes from behind is strange.
Many of New York's recognition lines are due to fraud: sights of high buildings begin to freeze, the city's slums become too loud and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And not yet, 35 years later, you've got a whole lot more than that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage, but a big truck wheel in North London. Yes Old Swiss Cottage is actually a lighthouse pub, but it's not calculated.
Instead, the central forest is still a wonder - even to the extent that two years, one by one, and two fourths of women, enjoyed it very much.
I'd have given them a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week I was asked to assess my "compensation" at the level of one reference star before I put my credit card to the credit card.
The same thing happened in my home coffee shop, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15 percent service money when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This delays the archipelago's interaction and puts the customer's service in place of its own game in a situation where it does not need it.
The salesperson of the commodity industry was very sorry when I gave my credit card to a five-star user test.
Shefki Kuqi got shot off the Interist - "It wasn't about the trust of the leader"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqin from the task of the team's representative.
It is the responsibility of former Deputy Secretary-General Fabrizio Piccareta.
The other preparatory group will continue to carry out its current duties.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as a helper in the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta joined the Interin Preparatory Group has performed UEFA Pro licenses last year.
The President of the FC Interior Government, Stefan H√•kans, is sorry about what happened.
Changing the preparation is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq has no longer had the trust of the lead, where there has been no other option now, H√•kans commented on the follow-up information.
The Piccareta Agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He is responsible with another preparatory group in the early morning proceedings against HIFC.
According to the records of the night Sanomis, there have been long-distance tortures in the group.
Kuqi told the players this Thursday that the follow-up assistants Piccareta and John Allen have been transferred to their class.
Kuqi and Piccareta were strongly taken together in the course of the IP against Chemistry last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published an 80-year-old picture of a young man. Did you recognize a serious virulent?
In Instagram, the virulent Linda Lampenius published a youth picture.
The picture has been added to a number of puzzles that can lead to the conclusion of a 16-year-old student of Sibelius-Akatemi.
Lampenius himself admires the young women watching the heavy camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he'll send a message.
If you don't see a picture, you can look at it.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also talked about grave subjects.
A year later, he would publish his own picture of himself in Instagram.
The second picture shows him 20 years ago, the second one he's dating now, the mother of two children.
In his description, Lampenius refers to his own growth as a human and refers to food disorders he suffered as a youth.
I was 20 years ago and today...
I still look very much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to keep myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text, he had added your English hashished life, eating disorder, insecurity, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, parenting is a challenge.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his food industry for years.
He was 14 years old at the hospital because of anorexic and orthodox.
Shortly thereafter, he also became ill with bulimia, which finally appeared in 2006.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
In addition to therapy and comparison, the Lambenian helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital because of his gangs
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
In the last year, he received hospital treatment on his shores in the summers he was arrested by the prison authorities.
Pistorius was sentenced to murder from the original murder charge charged by the prosecutors.
He died as a friend of Steinkamp in early hours of 2013 by shooting several streets through the WC door in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to be his girlfriend's night watchman who hid in the WC.
The prosecutors have stated their intention to vote again because they consider the judgment of the Pistorius to be too slow for six years.
The Kingdom citizen intends to vote for the highest rights in South Africa, and this election will be dealt with as soon as possible this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the Pistorius Court may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for their illegal harassment in Greece
Two undisputed Bulgarians were detained in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country reported on the BTV channel.
The police arrested the group of people who had been tortured in Sidonia on the morning of August 1st. Two Bulgarians were in the camp.
They were released that same day, but the case continues.
According to TV TV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on public railway areas and have already given known ports to all those affected by traffic in areas other than for the purposes of storage.
Checks will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry reported that the right may be determined by the case.
- needed -7.7%
The oil tanker Nesteen's share was 7.7% about 11 a.m.
It came before the tax came down, but it went beyond Inquiry's financial predictions.
Today's trade in rice has gone smoothly on the side of the package in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Following the opening of small bags, the wide European Stoxx 600 index was 0.2 per cent.
The Helsinki stock index of OMXH was estimated at 0.3 per cent after a half-hour marketing period to 9509.48 points and the most changing companies OMXH25 was 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of powder was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was the producer of Nestet.
Red meat, dairy products and sugar may relieve the swelling of the affected sheep
Red meat and sugar may be heard from the pressure of the food system.
However, the study of milk claims that the choice of food containing raw meat proteins and dairy products may facilitate the occurrence of the damaged egg.
In the United States and in the United States about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, this is due to vascular seizures, security, repeated or blood clots, depression and extreme fatigue.
However, studies at Washington University found that protein containing the essential amino acid trithofane to help the body develop immune cells that strengthen bone density.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells protected their teeth and made sure that they did not hide dangerous microbes from food.
The cells that cause events balance cells that strengthen stability. They protect the body without harming the wise tissues.
If the balance is too close to the event, the result may be a loss of hearing.
Tests found that the immune cells that strengthen the stability of the tissue are found in hieroglyphic cells with bacteria in their genes.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to develop immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We have found a link between Lactobacillus bacterium and the development of cells that promote stability. Lactobacillus ureter is part of the popular normal microbiology," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mice had triptofane in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same applies to humans, Lactobacillus urea bacteria and triptophane-containing food supplements may enhance the susceptibility of the desired substance and reduce the toxicity.
In its study of immune cells that strengthen their stability, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one hierarchical group had such cells, they were not the same as the hierarchical hierarchical hierarchical hives that were considered to be different from the other group.
He doubted that the difference was linked to the interest of mice in microbiotics, or normal bacteria, and viruses in the food chain community.
When breast DNA was studied, six bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus bacterium bacterium was administered to adult rats in sterile environments with no known microbioma and no immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect their immune system. They raised Lactobacillus bacterium bacteria in the womb and transferred small strains ‚Äì without bacteria ‚Äì to immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells developed susceptibility as stable cells.
When the active substance was cleansed of pregnancy, it was shown to be a site product known as indioli-3 country acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofanes in the treatment of mice, the number of healthy cells increased by about 50 per cent. When Triptofane was defended, the number of cells decreased by half.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same stable cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus bacterium in our food chain.
It is still not known whether triptofan's site products from Lactobacillus bacterium develop cells in humans the same way as mice. However, genetic traits associated with triptofane have been detected in patients with severe renal impairment.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate the future of the teeth," said Cervantes-Barragan.

According to Jose Mourin's opinion, Manchester United got his "neron" tires made with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has received its "neron" lines to a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle player debied Manchester United on the line against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
From Chelsea 40 million, Matic, who moved to the capital of Chelsea, won from 2 to 1 win in Dublin, the last time the UEFA Super Cup was held against the real Madrid tournament. He made an impact on stars such as Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was still not in the best position, since he was not involved in the Asian Blue Cross before the beginning of the year. He spent only 45 minutes in the field ‚Äì according to Mourin, a change must come before the beginning of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his imagination make him nervous ‚Äì he has the natural ability to think, says Mourinho.
"We'll help him to be more willing than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukuku also played at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to relax during his initial meeting.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the follow has already done "a great job" by getting three of his four priorities set by the player.
"Three of four ‚Äì we have to thank you for this," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did a great job."
The pilots tried Germany for two years.
The Finnish women's airfield team destroyed its fourth launch of the MM Carcinta Market for Germany directly between 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level is high.
Of the equals their game was in each sector, Finland‚Äôs chief minister, Tapio Kangasniemi, told us in a statement.
In the first two cases, Finland faced a challenge, but in the third one, Germany was clearly stronger.
The Germans will lead the reading.
When we played patiently and in certain places enough aggressively, so we were able to move along, Kangasniem said.
Finland's most effective 14 points have been gathered to Piia Korhon.
Three out of four disappeared from Finland still last Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: A large company has already sent challenges in connection with the Russian approach to Trump Jr.
In the United States, a large charity has sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian singer Natalie Veselnitska.
Specialist Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of the Russian-known Russian poet, Natalia Veselnitska.
The news agency Reuters, which also strengthens the Wall Street Journal by calling on the school of a large fire department that was previously exposed as Torstana.
According to Reuters, a large charity has sent challenges to the meeting of a Veselnitskian known as Trump Jr and Kreml's kitts, which was held in the United States in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign director Paul Manafort and his nephew, current adviser to the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Specialist Robert Mueller has been invited to the school by a large charity in Washington means that Russia's research will be strengthened.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to study with the help of the great fire department, which sought to find out whether Russia's invasion of the US presidential elections and whether the Trump campaign or its close cooperation with Russia had been carried out.
A large intelligence company expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on the ground.
A large group of ordinary citizens are working behind closed doors.
The large intelligence company will decide whether or not it should raise the charges in the investigation by the prosecutor.
The British chemist microsirized himself to get home and car by hand
The British explorers have been the first to cross the entire country to open his home outside, get to his office, and start his car with a smile.
Microsiru is 33 years old between Steven Northam's back and forward. Now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their life easier by using the technology of Northham BioTeq.
Northam is working with Dr. Geoff Watson of the Royal Hampshire Hospital Hospital in Manchester, Winchester, in order to meet the requirements of the medicine.
The microsurgery uses the same technique as in cats and dogs microsirates, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's business also transforms the numbers of houses and cars into compatible microsir. One class treatment pays 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child. He has installed microsiru technology, his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to tax taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a seaman helicopter to the North American North Nursing House for production was to pay $24,000 for tax payers.
The white Sikorksky VH-3D helicopter is named Marine One when the president is in its seat. It was in the White House on 17 July 2017, during an event in which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were known for their products from all 50 countries.
In addition to the helicopters produced in Connecticut, the exhibits included the sea of Maine, the train of Wisconsin and the truck of Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested that the helicopter be placed on the site for only 36 hours prior to its landing into the south-east of the "extraordinary" network. This is reflected in the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter ship.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of the matter, because it is an exceptional event that gets very visibility," wrote the HMX-1 unit commander, who wrote an e-mail to the President of the Commission the day before.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern corner at 7:7 a.m. at 7:00 p.m. and that it would start at 3:00 p.m., and that the helicopter would be removed only after it had been cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m.
In addition, it was stated that if helicopters were to leave the White House late, another crew would need to be located because of the limitations of service times.
The original crew was in the helicopters for a time, and the unit's security staff was in the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received from the TIME paper are not clear whether there was a need for a second team.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits the use of the State's property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 reported a crime involving law.
"One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was violated in this case, and we were told that it wasn't a crime," he wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," said the call commander.
Made in America was an official event in the White House, so it was not part of the Hatch Act.
But the official events also have political difficulties.
At that time, the President spoke on behalf of health care and more available national regulations during the Senate.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not new.
The Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use is only unusual for photos.
In February, Trumpi‚Äôs actions were taken into account when Air Force One took the lead in the event of the president‚Äôs campaign in Melbourne in the state of Florida. Trump strongly criticized the use of his predecessor‚Äôs presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The poor house is very pleased with Made in America, where American workers' material was presented from all 50 countries," said paper Secretary of the White House Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and operate in the south-east corner by bringing the President to the White House within a centimetre.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training sessions in the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America are part of a monthly training trend for men.
On that day, the unit helicopters also flew 11 hours "in non-presidential support" for that day.
According to the White House, there were no other costs incurred by taxpayers.
The informant said that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation in the south corner of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have a written record of flights related to the duties of the President, and it is difficult to assess the cost of the event.
According to the 2017 VH-3D helicopter compensation, the amount of VH-3D helicopter compensation is $24,380 from the airport.
According to the HMX-1 unit documents, the flights from Quanticon to the White House in the state of Virginia support point and returned for one hour.
According to the White House, the use of helicopters is clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs incurred by the taxpayers is a matter of urgency," says Walters.
"The level of compensation assessed shall include the costs of staff, maintenance and many other so-called eligible costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 Rand Research Company, compensation costs do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel costs, repair costs and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former paper Secretary Sean Spicer of the White House defended the use of helicopters.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and to employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think that in most American ways we are very proud of the helicopter and other defence needs that many Americans have worked very hard.
It's quite relevant to bring it to light."
I'm not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the parking lot of the driver.
In a white house, Trump joked to the paper about his own Sikersky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."

The Venezuelan Government requires the right to ban the designation of a new representative of the country
The President of Venezuela has applied for a decision of the Court of Justice which would prevent the designation of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday's vote on the election of the representative, is intended to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative was elected to the country, which may, inter alia, change the constitution of the country.
According to rescuer Luisa Ortegan, the decision to prevent has been requested for election days.
There has also been a vote on the election poll.
He appointed two judges after the British company organised a representative vote said the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million greater than the number of actual voters.
The representative was required only to join Maduron, and in the appeal in 545, he and his wife, including the son and wife of Maduron.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representative may initiate opposition and amend laws leading to the Congress.
Maduru as a dictator
Maduron's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition must strengthen its position on the basis of the formation of the foundation by means of Maduro.
The United States has placed packages for Maduro and called this dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have stated that they do not recognise the new representative.
Maduro claims that the new representative is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, there has been widespread apathy for several months.
They have been victimized by numerous people and over a hundred have died.
Venezuela was in dire need of the oil price for the economic crisis.
Now many people don't have food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to be expressed in the spring when the new representative is intended to begin.
A Russian man sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
I was sentenced to 41 years in the United States by Minnea Police to torture by Maxim Sena for almost four years from being a prisoner to a worldwide computer service.
Serah was detained in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request submitted by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been in luxury in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland granted a grant to the U.S. law enforcement authorities in February 2016 despite the Russian opposition, says the news agency AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of dollars.
She's been in prison for 46 months.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Senah will be deported from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia strongly advised Finland after the arrest and said that it was not possible for a man to be granted membership in the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States indicated that detention was carried out in Finland without Russia being aware of the matter in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the Ebury computer virus, which included tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus has been used to fish users and secrets.
The drivers then used the information to guide further Internet traffic using click-and-click-delays and distributed roaches.
According to Kenneth Blancon, director of the Ministry of Justice's crime department, the case shows that the United States is also able to search other cybercrimes.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them before the law, Blanco told me in the knowledge.
Amended at 20.58: Lettering of the name of the person who has been sentenced.
Narcos's third production plan trailer: Pablo Escobar is gone from pictures, so the Cali cartel rises mainly in Netflix's hit-and-run series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered on another production market in Narcos, Netflix's series is not really finished.
The Direct Service has already confirmed that the series is shown in the third and fourth production lines. A third trajectory has been published and a new series will be presented.
On the third generation of production, U.S. drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world‚Äôs richest drug trade organization.
In addition to the fact that the charity and the violence of the authorities are a little more than "like Fortune 500", the organisation's leadership of four of them works "like Fortune 500".
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) maintains contacts with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
Recently published in the trailer Pedro Pascal makes a request to Javier Pe√±ana, who colors United States and Colombian police officers against the fight against drugs.
The new plants are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production line starts on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional lighting theme in Paris
The Joensulian Light Bearer Kari Kola (in Arabic) will perform an exceptional lighting theme in honour of Paris on the first day of the UN set up by the UN on 16 May.
Kola is making Paris's lighthouse on the name of Day and Night.
The theme of the work is light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
In the process, we will highlight the construction of the capital of Unesco Fontenoy and the Globe monument that is represented by it.
I would like to highlight the light in my work, as well as the darkness.
Today, the lighthouse of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise important issues of my experience to be concretely visible, says the writer Kari Kola in his work.
I am very encouraged to be with you on the first international day of Valo and to bring the light to part of the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening year of the Valo theme year in 2015, when he celebrated the day of the festival as the chief of Unesco.
I feel very privileged to carry out my mission again to the capital of Unesco, Kari Kola tells me.
The work can still be extended really much.
We'll know about this later during the coming attack, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Day is to raise awareness of the importance of mankind and increase human knowledge in the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first day of Valon is celebrated in the capital of Unesco in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men lost their shopping center in the parking lot in Espoo
Two men were born in Espoo at the Ison Omena Parking Centre on the morning of the morning.
According to the parties, there was a beginning when the other party was engaged in an act that was prohibited in the accident.
There was a verbal conflict between the drivers.
The driver who drove a forbidden drive would call the other driver, which resulted in the moving of this vehicle into a broken car.
After this, he found a broken car on a plane.
The man has given in the original conversation the damage he caused and the wrong thing he did.
Written by Timo Soin on the question mark: "Then came the water pressure"
Foreign Minister Timo Soin (v.) would publish a blog post in Torstana, which has been addressed on the subject.
The writing is short, only the size of two pieces.
During my time, the party grew from zero to one of the thirty-first representatives of the Government.
After that there was a flood, now it's time to write Sonin.
There are references in the text to the 1700th-century French.
King Ludvig XV or this lover's lady de Pompadour is known to be using a water ratio.
Depending on the interpretation, history books have left out the solutions "the amount of water after us" or "the amount of water after me".
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on the political role of women
The elections are representative only if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, said the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
U.S. interim leader Nicholas Haysom, said that there may be hundreds of women in the municipal councils, three women have tried to become vice-presidents, and more than 30 per cent of registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in his midweek opinion.
Elections can be usefully representative and credible only if women participate fully and are taken into all parts of the electoral process.
The presidential elections of the Afghan National Council and the presidential elections shall be held on 5.4.2017.
Taliban has presented threats to voters while international groups are moving into the role of the Council.
This year's elections are the first time when power is peacefully transferred from democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Board, 1.6 million registered voters are women.
The spring is sandy and windy
I mean, I'm gonna get you some red sands right there.
In the capital city, the weather is sandy and quite windy.
In the evening, the cloud layers build up and can be developed.
There's a lot clearer and more complicated tonight.
It can also be seen in the south and in the middle of the country.
In the evening, there's a nicer and clearer dinner in the south, one of the seeds that can still come.
The afternoon temperature is about five degrees Fahrenheit [- 50 ¬∞ C].
In the north, darkness varies and becomes local nighttime storms.
At noon and during the afternoon, low pressure controls the position of the country in the south and the central part of the country, and the ports are general.
In the north, the ports will be small.
On Thursday, in the south and central part of the country, hundreds of places, as well as the entrance.
There are also ports along the coast of Kainuuta.
In the north the darkness is cold in the evening and becomes unique seeds.
In the south coast of the country, wind is rising from lunch, and in the central and northern regions of the country, air traffic is on the horizon.
On the British Isles, there is a strong low pressure which is linked to the landing of those red ports south of Fennoskandia.
Western and central Europe is dominated by the Western Hemisphere and comes with some surprises.
In southern Europe there are sun and heat, and the temperature is at least 40 degrees above.
In the eastern part of the Mediterranean, there are air currents.
The coming of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
Officials are considering the limited number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, local borders focus on the form of tourism by rail.
The Italian Ministry of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: only a few hours and many sights are taken over.
Russia has spent a few short days on the city's tourist journeys.
On the streets there are hard traffic and great open spaces are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice are no longer able to join the group.
They have been forced to move from a more distant historical centre to the same place as the hotel room has become.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problem of tourism in Venice.
Officials shall consider restrictions on tourist destinations.
They call the current appearance a bad quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When reached with a large cruise ship, the time is given for two or three hours.
Follow the steps of Piazzale Romalta Rialton to the wall and to the tower of St. Mark, and turned back, describing the tourism of the Italian Ministry of Culture, Dario Franceschin, which is dominated by the problem.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture but also in the operation of premises, shops and workplaces.
We need to keep this part of the city's identity.
The Tower of St. Mark is thus one of the most popular tourist sites in the historical centre of Venice.
The tower is located in the Church of St. Mark.
The local capacity also focuses mainly on cruise routes.
In the historical center of Russia, there are more than 50,000 locals.
In 1951 there were some 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, 2,000 Russians showed their opinion against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their lives, destroyed the environment and displaced their inhabitants.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this goes on, after a few years in Venice, there's nothing like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says an interesting statement by Carlo Belframe.
The same is difficult because the ships will bring it to Russia with the necessary revenues and create a need for a number of different areas of work.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, your solution is to allow passengers to travel farther from the historical center.
The situation of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Russia, would certainly have changed if the Venetian administrative area in which Venice is located had more power to decide on its own matters - unless full autonomy.
In Russia, there are approximately 20-30 million tourists every year.
Are you on time in Kuopios?
Motor vehicles weighing up to one kilometer
On the north side of the motorway between Kuopio and Silinj√§rve, there have been a few miles from work on Thursday morning during the back road.
In the area, the engine is being operated, which slows the traffic down, says Savonomat.
According to the data, there is an hour limit of 50 km instead of the normal hour speed of 120 km.
However, at 50 km of the border area, the traffic has improved during the day of the tortoise.
On Thursday morning on the side of the Sea of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Revelation, or at the point of a golden cave.
I'm going to do a good job without that kind of attention.
At the age of 23, the runners had to notice the public cries.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of himself, including in Grand Canyon's landscape.
The Danish-North Amalie Iuel has grown up in his current home in Norway as a sportsman, not least because he broke up on 26 March of his old Norway's 400-foot advance during a 51.81 cycle.
A month later, he improved 400 metres of assistance during Norway's forecast 55.38.
Iuel, who is currently using social media, soon learned from his predictions that audiences and audiences are blind.
Men around the world began to send pictures of their sex organs to Iuelle, apparently hoping that a young runner would be interested in them.
I had to close my Snapchat account outside.
I got a lot of "thirty pictures" from unknown people, so I had to change my license to private, Iuel told VG.
Iul did not want to know exactly what pictures he got in the VG challenge.
I'm sure you can think of it, Iuel.
It's nice to get back after the run, but I'm going to do a good job without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, father a Danish-Northian.
The family of Joel moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, his family changed because of his father's work in Namibia, then Pakistan.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
For four years Iuel served as a university student (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he became a citizen of the Danish state of Norway.
In Norway, Iuel is conducting three preparatory exercises, including Leif Olav Allenes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
There is much more opener debate in Norway than in the United States.
In the United States, manufacturers do not ask for anything but only rules.
In Norway, there is much more time left for personal activities with a sportsman, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel is holding out the prophecies of Norway at 400 metres and 400 metres.
I'm gonna take Janne Korve to the entire U.S.A. with the MM.A. now, "I'm sorry when I don't feel anything."
Now it's been a nice landing when there's nothing wrong with it!
Janne Korpi, 31 of the most successful world players in Finland, has been able to enjoy his love again.
In the last summer, the Uranus continued to be tested.
In January, Corves had forced more weight on the table, and his legs did not want any improvement.
I've got my hands in my pocket.
I didn't know anything I was doing, whether I was going to continue or not.
Sponsorides were on the roof, and many things were open, Korpi tells me.
But it's said that there's a way.
My foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and blood began to flow back into the chest.
The decision was easy after that.
I knew it at the last time I didn't go anywhere.
I was so fucked up, 'cause this is so fun again, let's get some more water through it.
The body was able to calculate well in August, but after a long calculation, it was just a matter of training without any stone.
There's only a few of them running around.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of marketing for Corvell.
I've never been down for one kiss.
I think it's going to be four years old for one kiss, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think of it like that, Corp says.
Today, Corpi is serving as a half-pig of MM cheese held in Spain by Sierra Nevada.
Although private cats don't even hold him in a pair of shoes, he will always burn out of severe pain.
According to Corves, the value of the international showcases has increased over the past few years, although some of the performers have also chosen Norway X-Games, which is held at the same time.
Yeah, it's important. It's great. It's great.
Indeed, I think that my assessment always depends on what circumstances are and what level are in the cases.
Corpi is the oldest sportsman in the 12th enemy group of Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The deaths of the group, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekakis and Emmi Parkisenniem, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was there at the same time that everything was new and it was so sick of everything.
It also brings new powers to itself, Corp thinks.
I'm still standing in the back of my chest, but otherwise I don't, it's in my friends' shoes!
On the back of the railway station, Janne Korpi has also built other types of sports.
Pekka Korve‚Äôs son has been involved in the treatment process: he has his own treatment courses for which he is conducting training programs.
When I'm on my way all the time, it doesn't make it any more possible to be in the Messiah.
But I look at at at least the treatment results every day, and usually something to go, Korpi tells me.
The management and preparation of treatment are a potential root plan for Korve when it comes to decision-making.
I didn't mean to plan that long, but it's at least a possible option.
I'm doing it as little as I'm going to study it at the end of this spaceship.
I'm trying to stay on my nerves and develop. I'm running out of time.
If it's my future professional, then it's not hard to start when it's already ready inside.
The treated patients also include the Jaajo Linnoma-based Elitloppet-Raviristeilile with Jaajo Linnoma.
Both of them have rented a cruise race that will end in Tukholmena Elitloppet therapy competition in late May.
Corpus and Linnomia decided to bring back to life their old tradition.
Cristeily's gone very well, and people's been in their insinuations.
Now we're already at the point that there's no competition at all.
A few months is still time, hoping to get the ship full, Corp says in his excitement.
Attendo's maintenance project for Kite has surprised everything.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-place nursing home for Kite.
The construction of 1,700 square meters in Russia is first prepared by the health centre next to Health.
In the meantime, the general question of surprise is what customers need in the new treatment unit, as many private treatment homes can now play a customer game during your war.
Regional Director of Hospital Services Anne Flink Attendolt commented that in the future Kiteel has more to ask for in addition to options for improved service delivery.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the free choice also works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private clinics from Kite last year from Kanervikola and Erieka.
Trade concerns business, but of the municipalities, there is certainly a five-year lease agreement.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations off these premises.
More about today later.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the operation of the McVitie's brand Scotland
The trade union shall apply for confirmation by McVitie's manufacturer for a long-term commitment to the production of Glasgow.
According to the Department of Scotland‚Äôs GMB of the Iso-British General Professional Union, the company has not been informed of Tollcross‚Äôs future plans.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea tests and other products have more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company owned by McVitie's brand told its investors over five million pounds in recent years.
The company added that employees and representatives of the trade union are "probably first" if there are changes in their activity.
In a letter addressed to the Chair, GMB calls on the company to "response that the modernisation of production lines has not been shown from funding".
Mr Drew Duffy, the GMB Commissioner, is very concerned that there is no clear information on the needs of Tollcross's business and the future investment plan.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force has concentrated strongly on the local community and the large city of Glasgow. This is a major task for workers in the area of high unemployment and low income.
In view of the decline in employment, wages and income and Brexit, the rising cost of living and production, the eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production with great intensity."
According to the rapporteur, the director had received a letter from the trade union on the previous day and the company would respond directly to the letter as it considers the continued interaction with employees and representatives of the trade union.
"We had regular meetings with workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with our employees, including that in the ways of other companies that are highly competitive and insecure on the market, we continually assess all our business activities and facilities to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the rapporteur, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the past year to make Tollcross, in particular its production lines and the improvement of its activity.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and we will certainly tell the first employees and representatives of the trade union if we are to make changes to their activities."
Did PSG Barcelona warn you about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
The Law League can cover its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not create Neymar's objective after paying 189 million pounds of transfer contract. But was PSG Barcelona warned of the preliminary transfer three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the case in the meantime. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world's transfer costs. The previous forecast was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United 89 million.
After the move from Neymar, he will become the world‚Äôs most famous football player and also the world‚Äôs most paid professional coach, as PSG will offer him over 500,000 pounds a week‚Äôs salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be within its limits for the operation of the PSG and the habit that Neymar has been following. The source near Barcelona tells us that the follow has been very good for Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City reported its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best-selling fans.
"I don't care, because they know that if they find our players, we will be their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the guards.
But if they find our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG's central player Marco Verrati earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not be possible for Italians to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its star player Neymar.
