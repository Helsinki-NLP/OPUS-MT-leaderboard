Triomphe of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent to total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant decrease in the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a significant increase in the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (OPP), where current President Wilhelm Moreer's position is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of their votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of their votes.
With 25.6 per cent loss of nearly nine per cent of the votes, the CFSP has been even worse.
This is the best results of the two major parts of the post-war war; in particular for the popular party, which has triggered the earlier elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular party had considerable progress on the SPÖ.
But the electors are apparently hunting them for letting the government collapse.
From the first response to the results, speculations regarding the possible withdrawal of current party leader and vice- chancellor Wilhelm Moreer were made.
The observers believe that this could occur from Monday, when the Special Board of Directors of the Party.
Such a development would give priority to the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the major SPÖ and OVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have received 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of votes - socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repeat in 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, namely that BZÖ was separated) on a common government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and intended to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently focused on this development.
The last party to have access to Parliament as the Greens, but these have slightly lost and re-embarred, among the Austrian political parties, of the third in fifth.
Of course, no other party shall break the limit of four per cent and shall not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are at risk of freezing
If it was not possible to solve the problem of the Czech researchers accused of illegal gambling in India, it would be inferred, according to Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain freeze on Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then there would be some freezing," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, speaking out of speakers, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who had been charged and punished with fines, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"It's a problem that could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then request release under custody and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expresses himself in the same sense during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, following which he may be thanked," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in this case is to provide the defendants with "a competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such aid had already been provided by India.
"We wish above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that has continued for many years.
Indians also recognize it," indicua Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told the Czech Republic, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic had given great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great fraud," he said.
The Minister mistakenly asked whether he had received an offer from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said.
A Czech arbitrate the struggle for the bottom of the sea
It is close to an electronic wall map, which is represented by Australia and adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but to a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea team.
His head, the head of the department, Czech legalist Václav Mikulka, followed by the presentation and full time to others.
The decline in work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed covers a world unknown to date, rich in natural resources.
There may be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the unknown, which may contain the key to the development of anti-cancer medicine.
A broader background than the earth
The liturgy States began today to breathe with enthusiasm in the new sub-marine territories.
According to a United Nations Convention, they are acting in accordance with their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly the area of what is called the Continental Shelf, which is often several hundred miles away from the country's border.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"In order to simplify it, it is considered as a continental Shelf part of the seabed and its sub-soil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundary of the littoral sea, often beyond two hundred thousand seafarers who represent exclusive economic ione," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the Continental Shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on a broad perspective and cost-effective metric.
This is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and scientific assistance to the Commission.
To date, the Commission has made five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to significantly expand its sub-seas assets, has recently been known as a global containment.
New Zealand has also won the territory - the size of the seabed, which has been allocated to the Commission last week, corresponding to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the size of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in the prospectus.
The benefits they will derive in the future of the operation of the marine fund will be, as they plan it, priceless.
Progressively, other countries will present their requests to them.
They can do so within a ten-year period after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental Shelf ends, begins the oceanic fund area, proclaimed by the Convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no more state plays an exclusive position.
The right to withdrawal in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"However, we don't deceive, the seabed isn't a Klondikee," said former Director Mikulka, explaining that "these areas are just clearly defined and their regime extended to a contract."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the marine fund is today also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former blockade of the countries of the East in the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It was obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as by investors from several other States, as well as by the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
She has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area expected by the investor is slightly beyond the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved, this is a kind of sub-marine response of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from a wide area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," states Ind Pakshi Rajan, another legalist.
Robert Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the Division, provides an example of such a construction.
She recalls a small piece of land, or well, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on the scene for the liberation of hostages
The Government of Egypt had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never went through the action.
More details on the conditions of the release of 11 European tourists taken from Egypt are revealed.
According to instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German Special Forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal military personnel and GSG 9 officials from the federal police and federal criminal police office, as well as logistics experts from Techniische Hilfwerk were at the point of release.
As the Ministry spoke on Monday night, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of the release by force.
The Government of Egypt would have accepted the help offered by Germany to integrate it into the support force.
"It has not been well achieved up there," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The rebels had removed from southern Egypt the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian accompanyers.
After their removal from the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were crossed into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remains until now, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved are among the ones who have been saved in the meantime arrived in the city of Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say anything about the details of the liberation.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "Build" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces should have landed on a Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House rejected the rescue plan
The first room at the US Congress has gradually failed to save the financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was down in the abibe.
By 227 votes to 206, the House of Representatives of the United States rejected the rescue plan for the financial markets of the Government.
Despite all the calls by U.S. President George W. Bush and political men to the head of the two parties, the programme that should have addressed the chaos of the financial markets had not been achieved by the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the participants had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour even though the plan was unaccompanied.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he replied.
During the vote, the Dow Jones decreased by more than six per cent to 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the State aid plan could be achieved.
It is not long before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the vote, to fall again.
The experts are now planning new serious disturbances on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and room of Members and Senate is required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the next month, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the desire for German travel remains unsatisfied in this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a business number of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencys (DRV) entrusted Berlin Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations is already increasing in months of autumn.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRW.
The sources of these results are GfK's figures, which monthly analyzes the data on reservations of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
The reservations made since late August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be requested in particular, the DRW said.
There, the increase in reserves would be about one third.
On the other hand, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our opposite, would be destinations particularly sought by the Germans.
The planned trips are particularly demanding, explained Dr. Klaus Laepple's president.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organised trip".
Consumers can save money among others with reductions in advance bookings or All inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been well maintained although an increase in sales figures will be re-registered as compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann or Apres-Ski's hits continue, from beer in litres and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we didn't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television animator and wears a Tyrolian costume cut to measure.
I've got my hair covered, I'm a student, and my clothes are on occasion.
But one thing is for us: at least three minutes at the beer festival, and the photographers are already throwing themselves on us and filling up their memory card - very flat, and this is my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
Tyrolian good market custom seems to achieve its objective.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally living in the north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in traditional customs was so limited.
But once on the Thérèse place, it's half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one has the air washed or affected by shame - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume picks up some weird eyes in the state of the bananas-chocó.
A bavarosian makes me realize that I would have been wrong to attach my table: "On the left means free, on the left, on the left, on the left, on the left, on the right, on the left, on the widow."
Suddenly, I tripped my back hole to the left.
"That's better," she said.
Others don't give themselves so bad for these flanging technical subtleties and carry simple leaves, which are written on "Too drink to get dressed!" and expose us to their back train without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo" extended.
He tells me all of this after he calmed down from the cup he had been drinking before.
Right next to this fire door, everyone thinks it's a bubble.
So Bob's one of these "square hunters" who's very famous.
Others have no chance of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers' ribbellas are on the place of the party and have to take care of poor beers.
Instead, the nurses intervene - always by four, they train their city covered with tents in tents.
So it works for most of the guests of the beer party: it's empty, it's full.
Those who sit in the circle of holes under the boat are not visible.
"These are those who can't appreciate anything anymore," he called me one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappeared in the mine.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in town.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of having a dangerous behaviour.
He's been released since under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
As soon as Turkey did not intend to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate its country.
On the east side of Bosphore, 20 cannot be from Asia, one of the most final remains of its imperial ambition is lost.
Hydarpasha was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is equipped with horses at the bottom of the platforms, around which each of its angles is observed, such as some German provincial fairs.
The stones are salts.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the ballot, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway route to Damascus, Baghdad and its most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions were shattered during World War I.
His railway routes were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularity.
The isolation of its region to the surrounding areas, fueled by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire further advance Egypt and push the Turks and their allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha.
In 1917, a train loaded with explosive ammunition destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, including in the pages of history.
Today, however, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the east points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Party of Justice and Development in Power, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Insulation of its region to its surroundings, fueled by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a train headed by Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10- and-a-half-hour trip, landed on winding tracks where the deadline reminded me of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital as a new city of a new secular state, turning the dose into its former German.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the general district of the AKP, a modern ultra structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a development area, surrounded by half-built commercial centres and many patents where middle-man and woman managers meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other part of Europe.
It's a suit, tie and it's even Black Berry.
" The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked if" should not Turkey choose?"
"Turkey" said "does not want to have to choose between them."
He then pointed out a point that almost all those I could talk to were sincere: The Turkish railway is not only towards the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, so it is both a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the roads to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I meditated on these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in most cases, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that might claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (born 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart should include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were more than 20 years old refused to leave the heart.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the heart's will and ability to manage any type of music that was presented to him, whether it was Hungarian or Mexican.
Musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant throughout the years.
Remember how "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
Its baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though it never appeared.
Whatever musical standard it was, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver should be named riding, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962 and 1982 decades when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of her concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me and, sometimes, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on some people".
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (born 25 September) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while making a BSc, MA and PhD".
That's what's out of Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time finished a PhD theme on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; then published in 1958 under The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied in Houblon Norman, and in 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissipate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino to the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition " Flamenco and life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted me to the fact that they are simple and powerful and because they are always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second sale for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good housing, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
It adds some refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of conduct and allow for more substantial savings.
A revolution facing a revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it must be stressed that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is located in the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand market marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it considered sales to be 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 jazz since 2002 which represents 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
Officials of the Spanish branch hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
This is precisely the exit of the new Jazz which will allow Honda to throw most of the sales down in Spain.
In fact, the market officials expect the end of the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this part of the market when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a hybrid with five doors and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
According to the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
The trade launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five inches plus), its width is 1.69 meters (two inches plus two inches) and its axis is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five inches.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1,52 metres.
Dimensions also increase internal space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of an essential reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the buffer - which has a double base system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity more than the first generation buffer.
These dimensions are those of the version with an engine 1.4L, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lamps or panoramic roofs - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, part of the rear door of the first Jazz which was opened with a 67-degree angle.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing process, this small model will be equipped with two-price and 1,2 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the consumption of substance and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine stronger and increases the engine's regime.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm at 4,900 tr/min.
This propeller - which reached 78 horses on the former Jazz - presents an essential consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which reached 83 horses on the previous generation, now reaching 100 horses.
This 100-pound Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres to 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'vehicle' that avoids collisions
In order to improve the development of disaster prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, particularly by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, following the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Metic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre from the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of the Management of Marks, BR23C represents the castle of Nissan.
This robot will allow vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval form that is very similar to Nissan security locker.
But most importantly, these are the eyes of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
In order to regain this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locater (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles located on a distance of two metres and in a 180 degree radius, calculates the distance up to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bending its 90-degree or more wheels to avoid collision.
The greatest difference in relation to any other existing system is that the evasion process is entirely intensible.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act in accordance with these data.
There is no need to store information or intuitive logic of pre-existing works, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen memory KBs.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory giga-octes, or even megabytes."
This is the first car to develop new anti-collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer batteries, which are smaller and longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They were afraid to be hypothetized
It must be recognized that the United States Treasurer, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not a genius.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to avoid Americans being in mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel '.
It's the "Hotel of Bad Credits" or stories.
The bright aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master gives us a number of times to think about whether it is a good time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
This game is sure to provide useful but not detailed information.
It's more than a game for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced his entry into his Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will spend nine billion dollars on taking 21% of its capital, a new host by a strong decline in its Bourse course.
One week after a provisional agreement had been reached, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to purchase 9.9% of regular operations by Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $33 billion.
The price held is less than 19 per cent at the accounting value of the securities until 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, providing 10 per cent of its yield and assortment of a conversion price of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley pointed out that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 per cent above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley's action was 6.79% to $23.07 to 1700 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking status," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities, but this is done under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis makes Wall Street's biggest names more cautious than ever before.
The arrangements presented Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "our pensions would be fully composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover them."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities to Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if they change more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47 over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow him to take investment opportunities, increase his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesman refused to give clarifications on the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
Following the investment in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, his balance has been "clean up".
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, which has seen its course of Bourse half-founded while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was concerned.
This cost was on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "savior" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's kidnapping, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Reinforcing the Republic around the socialism of the 20th century.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, at the request of its counterparts and friends, was the third who voted in favour of a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because 64 per cent of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results of 80 per cent of the complaints.
According to these results, the "no" received 28 per cent, 7 per cent of the complaints were null and 0.7 per cent were white ballots.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to receive half of the more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the voting offices and a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory between 63 per cent and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa had also been reselled on Monday night for the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has tripled dramatically," he assured the Ecuadorans at the headquarters of the government of Guayaquil at 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As you can see, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The survey, which took place in peace under the United States Observer Mission (OAS), took on a text on 444 points confirming the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution confers on the State power over the economy, subjecting it to the "development planning" of a country that is primarily dependent on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign foreign exchange firms.
The project, which was launched by Korea in 2006, also provides strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to disband the Assembly.
Korea had already announced that it would use this power and would set up a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of freedom of health and education services that the President has begun to install in this country 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end with the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian basis as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the strike against the rapists of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the wilderness were brought this afternoon healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the receptions arrived at 1530 hours on a special plane at Al-Maza military base, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, on board helicopters to Maadi Hospital, a residential bathroom in Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the rapists," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a Safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been stolen from one to another by 35 unknown rapists.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, which were on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night just before the storm.
"An exchange of fire cuts has occurred, and half of the rapists have been killed, the others have gone away," said the manager who demanded the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces "clear" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they had received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini referred to Belgrade, where he found the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He has also depreciated the payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army, had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which was found by the rapists, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately depleted by this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture leads to shortcomings and takes place in this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who is going to pay for the poverty money given to small museums, archives, archaeological museums or national historical sites that grow in hunger?
What politicians will remind the federal government that he ignores its monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French Government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinese castle in the valley of Loire?
In our fellow Americans, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historical Companies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genetics are concerned about the collapse of history, the preservation of the history of three under the monies of private archives and the preservation of archaeological evidence.
These are often those who are the shepherds of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeterys.
When is a court for history and heritage?
The governments of Benelux nationalize a part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian- Dutch bank, as the first European bank institution in the face of stress due to the cloud effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partly nationalizing it. The three countries support this financial institution with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, which also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been expanding for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase nearly half of the bank's capital (up to 49 per cent) in each country.
The bank will no doubt sell part of its shares, including, firstly, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired in the last year of the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis' actions began a vertical fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis were already revealed in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the disaster.
Nothing but Friday, the company's actions fell by 12 per cent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two thirds of their value have fallen.
Taking into account the current value of actions, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to company leaders, is not realistic.
The company's management is accused of foreign-Atlantic uncertainty with regard to the adoption of the US savings plan of $700 billion, which is the source of the loss of Fortis' actions.
Monday, paper has already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as a new director general.
The financial body also sought private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the basis.
Earlier, the Belgian Government had announced that investors should not worry, they should not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency has been taken into custody.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired lease companies.
A look in the mirror
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their medical purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that allow the use of information on prescriptions, in all cases, to agree with the person concerned.
This kind of program must be found among independent hands, but it will return to trust its wallet to a reputation" - Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage the prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on insurance premium and insurance capital in the event of damage, on the customer's health status, and if they think the risk is too high, they don't even take care of it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after having been informed of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he is easily provided with medications, the data on the purchases of medications by the person in the past eighteen months. Since then, the program has determined for himself, what disease the person is suffering and what his health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high blood fat rate, which puts him at a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurance on the side of the paper. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a medicine can be used for various purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or heat pumps, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by the insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed research and data analysis. They should ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacist.
As a result, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analysis and are related to data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide a more detailed portrait of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its field of action is only for practitioners and insurance.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities with regard to firms specialized in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he developed more before his programme, which would require the transmission of data to the person concerned's exclusive agreement.
It is another matter to know whether the person concerned is really free to grant his or her agreement or not, because if he refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and finally, the pulses depend on the well-being of the yard.
The Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India are multiplying by two trades.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit on the other side of the world.
Today, there will also be a French-Inde summit on the issue of nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognized that India was an emerging democratic power to give a wider voice in international affairs, but the Member States had not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its nomination as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They are no longer too late for this issue, tomorrow, at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would multiply by two commercial exchanges, which means an increase of one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have agreed from a legal point of view on the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, which will also enable air exchanges to take their place in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with one another, India, which is the first EU trade partner, and the other, New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and it was urgent to hold an United Nations conference on this subject.
The completion of the Doha business cycle was also requested, although both had a large share in the current deficit.
The EU confirmed that it remained loyal to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would want to reduce at least 20 per cent of its toxic material waste by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising prices for food goods, and they supported the convening of an international work meeting to review the financial crisis.
The head of the Indian State is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the press agency, the agreement would take 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers are present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Hall with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as an guest of honour.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a point Italy-264 square metres of exposure space.
It will be followed by your meeting with the press in the Room Structure, at Chapter 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books gradually decreased as compared with the total Italian production, and in particular with that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
Debris were found on a 3,000-metre-high platform in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, avoided the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it was the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore indicated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding areas.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators sent to the premises identified the device: well Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset landed in Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the species of money and a pulse.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the tour of the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the tour of the world in planes and without stairs.
Of all these records, it was also the one who flew 15445 meters high on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the community of an original and well-defined design, on marked lines, on wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the "compacts" off the street of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh air in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content it will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th next.
Thus the advertising battalion that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a future 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car fire.
A project of max displays, discussed in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special lenses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that when we look at the image, the car goes out of the view.
Then, through the use of innovative technology Elimina8, the new glk will be enlightened according to the spots, in all its details, to then recompose in a single image.
It is clear that with this publicity, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyping field of car communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We'll be fine.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who have so far never created major problems.
He never met the opposite typhoses.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (or in reality) of Campania and Poilles were added.
They had triangles on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They're inspired by English typhoser.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi typhoser, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian typhosi, 144 tickets for the party: all nominatives, and therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all of them checked: among those who were involved in Sofia, no one had a Daspo in the course, no one had been prohibited from attending a stadium.
Four Italian typhosi who had formerly been a crime scene, had no right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the deeds that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take measures: in this case, it may be possible that typhosis is arrested or identified in the congregations to clean a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits frequent Italian cities, but also Europeans.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand in the city.
Good luck.
But now is the time of fear-immulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to hundreds of fifty-firsts.
"We must increase this fire immediately, and not legitimize it" supports the Viminal.
So, "Keep your eyes open especially in view of the match of the national Wednesday team in Lecce"
In the Poules there is actually a small number of support providers from the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet on Tuesday, the Casms that can even rely on a section of the House, i.e. secret services, which are just dealing with state problems.
"Doce-Duce Hearts, and the arm stuck during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
This is the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect at Trieste, where there was a bunch of supporters from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, Louer Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add to the Observatory's No. 1 - the crimes must be attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate it for the future.
But let's also talk about sympathies against the Hymmele: those are not crimes too, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
