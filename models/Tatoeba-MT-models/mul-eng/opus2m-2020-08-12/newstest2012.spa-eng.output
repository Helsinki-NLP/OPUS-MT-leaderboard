Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has today rejected the proposal to derogate from the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code in which the leader of the opposition is Julia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open doors to the imprisonment of the Ministerial Express, but parliamentarians refused to propose reducing the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia destabilizing for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is still not valid, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political advantage of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes would be required for its approval.
Libya's Victory
The history of freedom of freedom, or of the freedom of rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gadafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
Stop by defining who the winner is
As is customary in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now they are trying to figure out whether it is moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has entered into force the traditional law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, for thieves will be cut off.
Women can now go forget about emancipating and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Rather than by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warring tribes, will be united by the Qur'an.
In Libya there will be an order which we cannot or can't imagine and that we certainly can't.
However, our way of life is not the only one or objectively the best and most likely it did not agree with the above-mentioned libidos.
It is true that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by a U.S. general, but by God, whose greatness followed each of the successful interventions.
When they're looking for winners in Libya, the West isn't among them.
We are trapped in a terrorist who serves Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political alliance without any guarantees of benefit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not hold Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossed"
But without any occupation, will the oilers be able to make with the black blue gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that the West can finally assume the protection of human rights.
As long as the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
Start a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investors
A statistical tortoise has been expanded by Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has been halted during the interquatrime period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bonus market has been recorded.
Investors are no longer established not only in Italy but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Chequia and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%
Both countries have made data public in the second quarter, in Germany has improved more than expected (a rise of 0.3 per cent rather than a projected 0.1 per cent), although a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (original data were speaking of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-month period, gross domestic product (PIB) has been suspended and according to the ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is consistent with the trend.
The results are even worse than the analysts' predictions.
Main events:
Internationally, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but it has stopped four-monthly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared with the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has dropped by 5.2% annually.
The interest in their bonds for ten years is 28.45 per cent.
The interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has increased to critical limits.
The problem situation also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest of the Czech bonds for ten years remains at 4%, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should grant loans at last.
Checks are classified for Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team completes with the most difficult performance of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and brilliant porter Petr Jiraček, the victory was awarded by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck at the second time, was miraculously defended from the attacks of the local team so that it would not miss the European campaign.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in a minor report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the demolition of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiraček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated his trip to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defence, the mountainers did not press until the second half.
The two victims of the party were Damjanovic and Vuchinič, who had two major incidents.
Moreover, thanks to General Petr Čech, the Czech 1st will not be missing at the date of the European Cup, so the ships of the national football will be awarded some 200 million crowns.
It's been a good offensive game since the first few minutes.
Both teams were so committed to maintaining the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure on local players in the first half of the country, patadons in the other defense field, just what the defence is supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die from their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundreds of university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for the country's nuclear programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students were able to pray on Tuesday morning before the facilities and then brought death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center in which they worked with uranium.
They intend to prove that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all indications, is struggling to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students were able to pray on the average before the Isfahan nuclear installations and then launch death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyse the Iranian nuclear programme, it would reach, according to Israeli sources, not only the center of Isfahan but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
A obese child’s daily menu: don’t give up and eat
More than a third of children aged between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with over 9 per cent of school population and obesity with 5%.
Obesity children come into most families with a life-style that is not healthy, according to current research.
It is again shown what is the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children are fed at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
To eat, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of children with excess weight there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, have time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted to 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same school education of nearly 900 children throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the programme "The Obesity of Not a Case", which was supported by the General Health Company and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th.
An adequate and sufficient family diet is crucial factors that significantly reduce the number of children with excess weight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals under the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for healthy diet," he adds.
No breakfast but with an embuted for dinner
Experts feel that, in a healthy development, it is important, in addition to the details, which also account for, for example, having a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In Chequia, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families are out at the same time.
In most families, each one is alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of the homes nothing was done.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in obese children families are consumed more frequently than in healthy potatoes.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink to daily sweet refreshments (70%).
Usually more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the selected keys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy food, are very different from the ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is particularly alarming at the popularity of sweet refreshments," was the final report of the study.
As a main meal, the palm takes the pasta and continues looking for the dog's meat.
Practically, children always refuse to catch and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive accurate information.
"In the study group control group, which filled the questionnaire after the completion of the prevention programme "Obesity is not a coincidence", an important change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy food", points out the results of the study.
He calls attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also be more often chosen by the questionnaire for the main food meat and fish and restrict the consumption of sweet food and its derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, supported by professionals
In the introduction article, how the estistalists learn, I have already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three branch professionals, how to wear problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us
And although the course is being developed every Saturday and Sunday, it's no longer worth an alfiler.
We've been studying with the director, Alena, (in the course no man) about how to dress a woman who doesn't have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone is calculated, someone has a styleless figure without the proper curves and someone suffers over weight.
The estillelist must know how to optimally smooth up a wide range of hombres, expand a corner or re-creat the necessary curves
We've been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of big bones and chains but tight belt and at the same time don't wear it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the chains is so far as the fold or pants do not fit, it is worth at least one piece of extra screen to measure.
No doubt they will not repent, because the clothing they feel is perfectly inappropriate.
With a slight failure it will feel much better than with someone who is not to move, get up, dance in the belt, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress with linens, ornaments, embroidered or embroidered.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have every week to order all this information on my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than one.
To each participant in the course, two famous ones have been assigned, who will have to design two dressers: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect must be taken into account, the fashion style appropriate to the person in question.
I've been "dressed" to Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, it's much better for me than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will finally have weighed a hundred pounds (please, take into account exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or look for them online and print them, to then design them graphically.
The fashionboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic aspect of style.
The estistalist, therefore, not only physically but also takes care, for example, of product pages in the magazines (of specific topics such as trends, pockets, covers, etc.).
All of this was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is already for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the estista should know you're out of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same suit of clothes in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such guabardina (or, as they say, trunch-coat) can be dressed in the classic with vases and shirts, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacon shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or just hold it and raise the neck to get a completely different image.
"Jugat with it," he insisted.
What's more valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Maybe you could break it off," said Jacob.
Finally, I see why we remember all these formulas, what they combine with why, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about waste.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a estistalist has to have more types of clothes on his reservation than he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), there must be preparations, lists to use, at least fifteen.
And as well as the photos work in combination with other takings, all of them are different from those used in reality.
All of this must take into account the time to design the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style are the only ones that, in many cases, half of success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquet have made it a world star.
In Chequia, for the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the estistas.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my abilities are sufficient, my physical aspect is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it must be taken into account that it is very likely that they indicate us a very different size from their real (less).
Then you will only be able to laugh and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has accumulated/adopted, etc.
On Sundays, Honza and Mario insisted on us not only to direct him in fashion but also to understand outfits.
During their work, it is especially important to communicate with the people you see, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't do anything, he's defending their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the dresser and complete it with beautiful handles, you can't take and take everything he's got and say, "Today what's scary."
"Find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend for someone to put them," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should end in the so-called "placovka", i.e. the working bag.
This is located around the belt and has all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as bricks, cuts, or impedible. There are also nylon wire (which serves the estylist during the session of photos of products such as bags or gorges), special grip pins of front handles, if this was bigger (the carpets and other types of hangars are not allowed, because they could damage fabric), or a costume game.
In order not to stay in the passive ear and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the soil of shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more outside.
And we did nothing but dress and dress.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the tires so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So I had to be very capable.
Mario has given me the joy of praising my work without reservations.
The truth is, I don't really enjoy these skills very well.
This is just a small part of all we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedication to professional style isn't a rose path, but it's exactly what people tell me.
A Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Resin
A trip, initially undisclosed, is complicated because of a series of inappropriate discounts from a routine trip during the morning shift.
In some way it was possible to cover expectations, but this does not mean anything if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, has awakened great expectations before its end.
I promised that I would give new air to the old race jacket Need for Speed and, because of the show, it appears as a game that should not end being a generation of action again without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would remain inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not differ greatly from what we expected.
There are careers that can be given by acceptables, but in the total computer, points are lost because of absurd errors, which have already appeared in the series over the years.
In fact, mistakes can not even be named, but they are better than the incomprehensible drawback of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
If you introduce them into a story whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career across America.
You sit on the flight to the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The road is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty careers.
It is therefore due to the fact that each road has a different path and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
Thus, one has no remote sense that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing in the other world.
But the passage through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow covered mountains produce a very pleasing visual effect.
In addition, careers vary from time to time by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find an sandstorm that reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains there is a need to be careful not to bury you in a cave.
According to that, each of the careers is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to step up to a number of rivals required (normally in a classic career), then try to earn time (classic duo chronometrated) and then wait for them a second against one opponent.
In the midst of all of this, the police sometimes appear, which does not make things even harder.
The news is the landscapes out of the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less landscapes in the game than I could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not come to be disturbing and, in the context mentioned above, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the lead of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a real simulation, you can already find another one.
But in a career designed with quite action it deserves enough this behavioral style, although we can find something better among the games of competition.
So far, it's okay.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same does not happen with collisions anymore.
Of games of this type you can't expect to enjoy complex deformations and collisions, but actually before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, which is not everything okay.
It's typical that, when you make a very adjusted advance or cycle the car with a normal traffic, there's only light roses, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirates.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the restorative system, there are no major problems, but it can put us in a bad mood.
The recipes are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last point of redemption on the track.
However, there are only five available residues in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to start the race from the beginning.
So it's no more than an aid if something's not going well, but it's not too hard to trust.
Sometimes, even the rest aid, just helping to learn the given memory step.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, it is impossible to take.
Once again you will find "civil" vehicles in some place with the same configuration, although you are the first, five or five minutes before or after.
This makes me angry, especially in situations, when you see that two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn or turn well.
It's the same as when you arrive, because it's programmed because "surprising" will always happen in front of your noses.
Opposers also have another advantage.
During the entire game you will arrive at sites where, without taking into account the moment, the same opponent will always go ahead on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, at a long point, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any price.
When you go ahead, you find it difficult to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car paper.
The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline can be understood, but execution is so apparent that it certainly disappoints you immediately.
And it's a pity, because although the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what's going on anywhere.
And it really does the same if the merit takes the idea of fifty exclusive tracks or the classification on the road so that it doesn't break the frustration, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars in the streets.
You have to be careful with the gas outlets on the side of the road, because just there you have to change from car to car, even in most cases you'll get what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, the American powerful cars for straight buses and the exotic superports for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a series of parallel challenges, i.e. there are careers in specific places that you will know by history.
Here you will get not only medals but also points of experience for your profile, which serve both the challenges and the accounts.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function has been connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career in history is done.
With the car you arrive to the metro tunnel (pass), where you are forced to run dark through the roads (pass).
The speed meter marks them between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, they reach the rear of the metro and carry them forward without further delay.
In the editorial we will certainly have a discussion on this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought a little or if the real authors take us for a bunch of boobs.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superior.
So it's a pity that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, at times, seriously.
This affects particularly the accidents where many participants have been involved, when the image quality continues to be invalid.
The audio is good and the sound band is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "every one of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoids completely broken mistakes, we would have problems claiming The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It makes sense that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.
The colours of the Carolina University will participate in the "Students of Terciopelo" concert.
The joint celebration of the International Day of Students and the anniversary of the Revolution of Terciopelo as a musical experience will take place the third time at the Festival of Academics.

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation for negatists and Eurosceptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years before the situation becomes a little stable, calm and new players are accustomed to their new roles," the Czech ambassador, Milena Vicenová, began his conference at the University of Law with conviction.
How not to take its "clear and open about Europe" issue seriously, which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with this precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many conferences of the U.C. Law College.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also stressed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council:
"The first comes up with criticism, that if it's insulating, a gray officer can assume any role, but I have to say that he left all the disagreeable, because he takes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to members of the twenty-first states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is an important step towards the unifying and clarifying of the political union towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vice-President of the Commission. — (DE) Mr President, I should like to thank you for your excellent work.
The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good abortion", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, it is necessary to adopt the budget for the EU for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which countries will be less effective?
The ambassador also recalled its main themes, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like fair abbreviations, foreignism or jargas that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the poppins do not really invent curved or round puppies, flattened by different sizes or that no one will ban us from Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to derive more benefits from the EU environment and to draw closer to more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We are waiting for Europe of Speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people better understand the negative aspects than the positive ones.
In addition, it regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is for a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, I highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Viseggrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and Hungarian come to me and I'm approached by an Slovak, a Frenchman beside me says to me, 'What have you already left, the Visegrad Group?', and it turns out he has no thanks."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-President Vicenová, looks forward to new strict budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real thing about the concept of two speeds, if they are no more in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It has been said for the first time that only countries that want and who don't want to stay out of the world are cooperating."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at two paces," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, it also highlighted the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all EU-wide issues should be discussed between Member States, not just between Eurozone members.
Fire story:
Innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone is looking for a term that accurately defines the IBM strategy, the closest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is now known as a company and, however, has already been through hundreds of years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-range character was laid by the first head of the firm, visualist Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already pointed out that many world problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His title "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the life of the future giant (also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for hundreds of years for that reason, because he remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fear of the changes around him.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to make further progress in our second century," he said during his anniversary, the current director of company Samuel J. Palmasano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in his 30s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the company of Batía in Chequia (the IBM employees were among the first U.S. operators to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that awarded to the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in relation to the client.
Since the beginning, the company has intended to discover talents (as one of the first global companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmisano will replace it in the year coming from a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working in IBM for thirty years, where she's been chief salesman, marketing and strategies.
Over the last few years IBM has participated in what has been called virtual encounters, a flood of online ideas, resulting in the infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It's not surprising they're talking about ideas, because almost half a million people work on the signature.
An institution with a good reputation
The position established in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the start, IBM maintained an institutional concept more than a technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"The IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," notes Forrester Research consultant George Colony.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering into business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or "Green Green" - as it is known in the United States familyly because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the past century.
It is possible that the most versatile technology company (development of both programs, infrastructures and web accommodation services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the automatic box, paycards, financial permutations, bar codes and discounts.
IBM will invoice $220 billion this year. This year has become the second market capitalisation technology signature (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the customer's taste and timing (IBM did not listen to its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PC PCr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, you can't get emotionally excited in the past," admitted Samuel J. Palmasano.
Therefore IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they do not work, leave them).
And that's the difference between competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future Technology
In terms of sales, IBM is dedicated mainly to services, of which approximately one fifth are programme and other five teams.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half the number of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first appeared.
IBM acts according to his first boss's premiums, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investments during the great economic crisis of 29th.
It seems that until now IBM's company has known how to deal with the crisis.
The value of IBM's actions has increased strategically to 120% since the beginning of 2008 and the net profit of the company has not been increased.
The IBM currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will survive.
IBM History: From Ches cutting to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in South American and South American branches.
The basis for the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies which are back in the 1880 ’ s.
He had inventions such as the famous "fixing line", which allows him to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the business man Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint turned to the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader chose the IBM founder (Watson's ideas are still the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, started with production and sale of all types of equipment for business, from meat cutters and cheese to registered boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the billing doubled to $9 million and began the large expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (Mercurio, Saturn and the famous Moon in 1969).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The "fish" classics that established the standard of computers at that time came to the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, on its part, acquired the part of the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering full advice and services of high value added.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these three years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances, for example, have improved with regard to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not much of the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the complete commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia since then, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalization centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. There is also a global fame research team working with the recognition of voice.
Rehabilitation acerca de su marido infiel:
Iveta, stay on that burrow, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richter (53) says it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartoshová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"People can go home, but not like my partner," explained Richter.
When Darina Rychtárová welcomed Bartošové during the summer in her home, she could not even imagine how she would end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ríčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared he loved her.
In time, Darina decided, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even resigned from him forever.
The Rychytar doesn't care who's suing his wife.
If one day Richtár broke up with Bartoshová, his wife wouldn't expect him at home with his arms open.
He's the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our home, no one will miss him."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear and old drunk who made mistakes, but as a man who binds me with certain ties," said Rychtárová and added that she had already resigned from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph still doesn't care if his wife has locked the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife has established this as a marriage on the role and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the house, I buy."
"Darina and I usually talk to us, the only thing we don't share in bed is that we don't share a bed," said Rychtár.
If Richard found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has any boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I love Iveta and take all responsibility," he concludes.
The worst vices of women: Are they also about you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, each of them will usually appoint them without any thought.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where are certain female vices that can give birth to the varons?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one treats a week?
Do you like to buy often in the discounts?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should be passionate about their passion for purchases, at least for a while.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk away from the clothes shops, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a period of time, men can become practically inferno.
Just remember how many times you told your partner that you'd better wait in front of the door.
Continuation of Satisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"It would take at least five kilos longer-- Should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her point of view.
It's not that you have to stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to your mate complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex is also agreed that the more frequent complaints, the more disturbing women become.
The order and cleanliness in the first place
He's like an infinite uncle.
Clean the windows, pass the aspirator, freeze the ground, remove dust, freeze the bath and all of that for at least two times a week.
Does he complain to his mate that he has washed his clean soil with a dirty foot, to his children who have cleaned up a newly cleaned laundry and a glass stove with glass doors that so much cost him cleaning?
In case you suffer this "division", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be taken into account as a priority in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make Unfailing Comments
"The calciumes used are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put those calcettes used tomorrow too"
"The ground is not left on the ground!"
If he makes those comets to his partner more times a day, you know that this will get him out of his castles.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you just want to make everything okay.
Perhaps, if men suspect this, women would not make so much comments.
Columns and Columns
Some women are also exposed to hallucinations, chismes, but also to offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
Best for each of us sometimes a small and harmless chisme escapes.
With the hand in the heart, this is itself of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are women who are chismos of those who do not control, whom they love to chismorrhage and do so often, they hate everyone and they become dangerous for those around them, especially in a female working team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to win Philadelphia
The hockey leader Jaromír Jágr participated in the meeting of NHL on Monday with two assistances that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in Carolina's corner and again put the Czech players in the competition's vanguard.
In both cases Claude Giraux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's game, and took a further step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two parties were assisted in the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told the journalists that Giraux had preached a great night.
"Before the game I had told you I'd do triple."
"It was presented."
"Sometimes they seem confused," explained Jágr, after his action gave him a bullet to Giroux, due to the first trajectory of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the Hurrians' door and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who put it down.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part they have already dominated the Flyers.
Especially for Giroux.
After working with Jágr put the third goal, after his shooting was closed by Wayne Simmonds's door room.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to be the best player of the band, but there is no doubt between the three best," Jagr pointed to his center.
"Never would have happened to me that at the end of my career he was playing with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in NHL, my friends played for me, and that now produces results," Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Rutu's ball and then again Dwyer's, of penalti, until it was put into a remote hole.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"I lost the disc, I took the speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I'm trying to stick you to the disc and I'm glad I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the East Conference.
The Czech champion of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, on the second third, was withdrawn by an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also because of a difference of two balls, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec is not supposed to use one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injuries in the last row, and play the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We only played the game with a veteran player, the rest were novel."
"In the end, but it's that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As much as rounding the players came back against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game further, get the disc out of our field."
"And so let's leave eggs," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
The Porter Ondréj Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to the 5-2 victory over the Bay Tampa.
Jet's balls were marked by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were sold in most cases only to the socialist blockade, since travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore took vacations at the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) in Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972 when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime moved west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (or, also the Czechs) would not be allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was impossible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one should get to the corner with a bag of sleep and spend the whole night, or have "good known" in the agency.
Still didn't get it.
The so-called "change promise" which was the condition for Western travel was not granted to the "politically unliquidated" people who could not travel in absolute terms.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a free convertible currency and, without an exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs had their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses that the Czechs would buy. This custom still persisted.
The way in which the Czechs travel has suffered has been a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was not going to take vacations in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, was unable to travel freely until 1989, because it was then part of Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, resulting in a huge oil of short-term visits, particularly in Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see the heat of the excursions to the West, all the world wanted to see it for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, checkout groups slept in the parks in the shops of the camp, since our incomes from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the checks at that time was taking with you food (conservatives, embuteds, etc.) to store.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversion of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living also increased the average wages with him, which resulted in an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increase in the demand for travel, the agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare the journeys using charter flights, which made the prices of the journeys considerably lower compared with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on passenger volume.
At the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already traveled almost all developed countries, except the United States, which made our journey even more simple.
Another interesting moment in post- revolutionary tourism history occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and it went to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists have made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit them about 100,000 Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post- revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated the visas for Czech tourists, with which our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent over 15,000 Czech crowns per head on trips to the foreign country, including expenses at the station.
Called the General Assembly to elect the President, which could end again at the point of death.
Almost five months ago, the Czech football is no president and it is likely that Ivan Hashek's successor as President of the Chechnya Federation (FAČR) will not be known after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the rules of procedure to be followed.
Without the same, no vote can even be taken to elect between the three candidates.
Interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
Hashek gave up his job in June not without calling on his colleagues with a view to finding a strong person who is supposed to take up football in the future.
However, after the Hashek era ended, a dispute arose between the two associations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was demonstrated on 16 September when the new President had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House (Národní dom), located in the village of Smíchov, because the talks were blocked and not only about the method of election.
No consensus was reached, nor was there on who in the General Assembly the right to vote - only legal representatives or even delegates with full powers.
From then on and due to this only point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, which provides that full representation is not possible.
However, debates on the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be drawn from the Executive Committee which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, essentially did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neurological point continues to be the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the point of death?
"The debate revolves around whether to comply with the statutes or to find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win that candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a larger percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemia Party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage estimates, should have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely reject the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the arguments of the living party, which would best not touch the order and vote according to applicable statutes.
It is also surprising that Thomas Paclik agrees, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is supposed to be more appropriate for Pelta.
"I would like to vote to the maximum extent in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to avoid any confusion about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who was first asked as a candidate and who directed his comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta's still being optimistic.
According to him, Nymburg will decide on the new president and he believes that future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will coincide with the party of our national team today at the European Championship.
"Football will become a protagonist again, and this will make it more enjoyable" says the representative of Jablonice, who has more experience in the management of football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most recent.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not a conflict between bohamians and residents, but there is an attempt to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"In any way, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if football team is complete?
The special plane in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucerra and Rajchl, has not gone out this morning because of technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport to the Executive Committee to the place where the ranking party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could ultimately be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they consider to be to be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to include the most powerful sports organization in the country in order to reach an agreement.
There is much in play: State subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Republic's Sport Federation (ČSTV) which will try to provide a new direction to Czech sports after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclik will fight for reaching the presidency because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen's footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas on the new President of the Chechnya Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate at such a relevant position.
"If there was an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and I wouldn't be presented as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day no such person has been found," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What moved Paclik to face the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Chechnya Federation of Football (FAČR).
Paclik also points out that, in the event of a win, he would only remain in office until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary General Assembly would come.
In that regard, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people who might take care of."
"For me it was a joke to hear some say that they don't even want to be identified with the Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is most likely to bother Paclik at this time is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the chair.
"If I win, the status will be maintained and nothing in the football will change."
"With Berbra's support, a man of ambition, football will get even less profit," Paclik said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta was liable.
"I don't know what prestige for football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will we look at UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who also carefully takes his previous statement that "will sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president".
In the case of winning the Thursday elections, Paclik could develop cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion, it is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly which ended in a vacuum.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also did not put the narcissies there where I do not feel capable," Paclik added, who in September drew much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitrary Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would be trained to manage the association.
He applied to its management capacity of private companies, as since last summer he has also been the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in football and contribute to your safe practice."
"In order to reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which are likely to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, resulting in unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antibodies to Sparta President Daniel Kretínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAO and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If the taxes on gambling increased, as political parties announced, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where this money is going to stop," she says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "in the party".
Pelta is currently associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense of giving up my actions at the Pilsen Club to another person and then go back there after a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised the FACHR new statutes that would end with the point of death of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Fütbol Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, the FACHR would ensure that the FACHR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve future disputes concerning the electoral rule.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburg, and he believes that the pre-election conflict could advance towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if selected, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could go well for him to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels are busy with football a long time ago and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," says the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, I think I have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hashek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civil Society was used as a sign for the benefit of delegates.
"If you choose me as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond if this happens."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to deal with your opponents.
He had already warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respected his training in law, aware that his opponent would also be his first Vice-President.
I had spent a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paclik who, on the other hand, did not let his head down.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and has already achieved some success."
"His attacks were embarrassing, and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," said his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the declarations announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, he says, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
This last one should be out of the promotion of football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately become involved in negotiations with the public sector and the private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," he said two months ago to the ČTK the 46-year candidate.
He also promised that his appointment as head of the football team would not result in any personal changes to the template.
"I'd like to know the tasks of every employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, he had a understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being vaccinated before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburg.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if he finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta continues to be optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, the FAČR would start working with the will.
If the fourth General Assembly elected current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as the new President of the Chechnya Fütbol Association, many people would certainly be held accountable.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, making more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hashek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself fully to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, through professional football or training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean I'd do it all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for the Czech Republic.
"I am a team player and I want to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with great momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this because it will mean to start working very hard and not just to criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not being presented again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent and impede me at every step," he explained the reasons for his decision.
"Many people have told me that I shouldn't give up because then they'd give up for the others too."
"It's about having faith to don't leave that way, no more," he said.
According to them, he also encouraged him to continue the work he had started with Hashek.
"In those two years, a large part of the work I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect within a few years and I would not like to have any fathers," he announced concerned that if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the time of Hashek.
"I believe in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to keep.
"After him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen ones."
"I can appeal to a lot of things, but not to the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's just how everyone feels and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
It also gives the idea that only the President would be foolish.
"Even though some people try to say the opposite, I have in mind doing the utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no present situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young live players," Rajchl said.
Although in the war of the presidential elections, Tomasz Paclik, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl did not cease to believe in its possibilities of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its vice-president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl, whose success includes the savings of tens of millions of crowns of dissertation contracts, television contracts negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of the guilt that the Federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in the Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer the football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event of his election, he will probably follow what Ivan Hashek had already begun and would not significantly change the staff pattern in the committees."
"I don't want to use it to my advantage," he evaluated his rival Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue Skip
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an amazing, sandy view in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live his beautiful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, relax his tired legs in boring baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and the middle of the year, there was something he could not miss in his team, a bathroom.
Tombed with shoulder to shoulder over the water, he looked at the copper art at the top, looked at the angels of marble, who looked forward to it on the pool's edge and was amazed at the modernistly restored covered pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the building's style and history.
Architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historical palaces of the bathroom in the Selva Negra, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "travel by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a truly enthusiastic bath culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the fans in the bathroom have to comply with blue and chlorine olives, while the fans can breathe the fascinating smell of the abets forests or listen to the joys of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the pools should always be so quiet," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The chapel in the pool and the terraces of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pool is so great that all the senses are met, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is done optimally: the high beads, the colour alkalis, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oasis of prosperity, but, above all, wants to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the examples highlighted in his research in Hungary.
Along with the great medical bathrooms such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, the water is found with nitrates in a single kalastic cavities (Bains in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as the terms, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városio Termáfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city places its eyes on the pool covered by Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which practice can be observed on ski tracks.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal looks like an oven that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources, steam rises in winter, while the mountains of Ötztal are basically up in the sky.
Alhambra in Selva Black
In Meder, the pool collector, he didn't smell chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths cry for oil, in Arpád's baths in Békescsba, Hungary, the gas plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitation bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkaline and whose alloy is attached to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of welfare.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discoverable swimming pools and solar baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he met with a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demoralized windows of the modernist red, white and yellow building, he saw the pain growing between the steels.
The decadence was contrasted with a beautiful pool in the Selva Black: the Termal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; they can not only be discovered neo-Romanian elements of times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab Hall of Alhambra style, which was added in 1900.
Since its esmeral modernization in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite pool collector's bathroom, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Selva Black.
"It is very worthwhile to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool appears to be of little importance.
Agricultural Speculation
The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the Chief of the Consortium wanted to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, to 84 percent of the Germans does not seem acceptable to them that banks are speculating agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifys the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of an investigation into the organisation of feedwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out that global raw materials bags bring prices up, and banks are responsible for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer defence campaign is directed in particular to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials deposits were intended to protect price oscillators.
The main experts agree that players have been detached from offers and claims, and they are benefiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "can compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the requirements of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, along with the recommendation on how to manage the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
Finally, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tried to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticisms to the financial sector: "The rising prices of food show particularly drastic how bank transfers currently damage public well-being."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all its investments in which it plays the money for food price deposits," Bode said.
"As if Ackermann is dealing with the subject of people who experience hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the Consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the draft directive would change something different from what was not planned in the Governing Council.
By leaving the controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs them only to pay for possible losses, so he will take care of his successor.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices will be fixed.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such transactions: according to the investigation, two thirds would cancel all investments from agricultural speculation.
The 43 per cent would advise a bank so that its knowledge would be known, the 49 per cent would request, after reflection, cancel its account and change to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The transferred palette
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with elevations and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 received prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, became empty and rested.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition house.
The modern post-Gera architecture is passionate, clear forms, crystal halls, valid curves and new construction materials, typical of the thinking on technical progress, so that the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Universal Exhibition of Brussels is an appropriate and well-known example.
Schwanzer's Babylon then obtained the Great Prix of Architecture by its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction has so far been considered a contemporary stage of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built Austria's palace at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW more the adjacent building planned in Munich, it became internationally known.
His palace, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was raised after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten near the south station in Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and within 20th century a museum was opened called "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked space and technology suitable for a museum; there was no wall to hold art, no good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until modern art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling ever more.
At present, architect Adolf Krischanitz has reformed the palace, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the balvedere museum was opened, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a successful strike in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, has achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic painter on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, carried out reforms with the intensity of monumental politicians and defenders, provided private funds and sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, works of the Dr. Fritz Wotuba of the humane foundation should be exposed, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also an office building.
Strict control, under budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna has been substantially reformed, it has been expanded and the competition has been awarded, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him an "important and huge place", where he observed "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the building problem, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for generous and easy use.
In current reforms there are major problems, the building was "a waste of energy," Kristchanitz said.
The profile of the glass façade window was changed, an insulating crystal was installed with glass fiber and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and the amalgam roofs rehabilitated.
Two satellites were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors remain, the house is painted in old rubber tones and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema room is just like it was before.
And all of this with strict control by the memory office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also enjoyed the monumental protection office," Kristchanitz says and warns of an expected soil in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The phrase "the wine of Brussels" has been difficult, said Kryschanitz a few years ago, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such a architecture is "always in the wrong place" and therefore wanted "to wake up the right conscience".
In this case, the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban accident. The completely new and planned "barrier of the central station", with apartments and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another hit happened: The house 21 could receive encouragement from another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlinian temporary art room and, as it is said, business with the city on a nearby site at the Swiss Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that rises to millions
The company has developed a crisis plan, which would prevent the winter trains from being hit.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against accidents and delays in winter trains, Deutsche Bahn has spent over 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Build" newspaper reported, calling for an internal group crisis plan, of the investments planned by 2005 of around EUR 300 million.
A better availability of vehicles and rail networks should be achieved with an even longer time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove the snow from roads and roads.
The objective is to clean snow and ice fields for operation and 90 per cent of the water required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of accidents and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the high-speed trains' axles with frequency at the workshop, after a high-speed train suffers from the breaking of an axle at the central station in Colonia.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in the United States.
After the talk about President Josef Ackerman, a new problem appeared in the U.S., the Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the U.S., the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to end the content due to five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial market regulator calls on many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have reduced the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to come to the courts," said a spokesman from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Mr. Debbie Matz, President of the NCUA, welcomed the challenge of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of fraud to protect customer investments.
NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also requested account from other large banks and, in the summer, filed disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of double mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate mine was launched in 2007, it lost many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently a complex wind for the U.S. banks.
Investors and inspectors have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or to punish errors.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the highest number of claims.
He appealed to the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac have benefited from mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a request from the FHFA, which is a business of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without calling an accurate figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributed 10 billion to IBM
The financial guarantor, Buffett, strongly invests in the IBM Information Technologies company.
Since March it has acquired shares of more than $10 billion.
So far, US major investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he does not invest in computer companies or Information Technologies because long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the IBM trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offered all of its services and sought computer systems for other companies' Information Technologies departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primaryity of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now emerged at the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hataway investment has risen with it to one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 per cent share.
Buffett said IBM didn't know until now anything about the commitment.
He commended the direction on common benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for a long time established the services of Mercuriative Information Technologies such as the operation of calculation centres.
The older computer pioneer for more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose businesses he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Her Berkshire Hataway has about 80 own branches, as well as part of a series of large associations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, was commissioned by the small textile company Berkshire Hataway in the 60s and, with wise investment, extended it until it became one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unfavourable sense of winning money has given him the upper name of "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's operations in box went up one percent.
"The blue giant," as IBM is known, has a value in the bag of over $220,000 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", Turkish media suspect the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloodier ideology" that is reinvigorating again.
The killings of eight small Turkish and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have an extreme right background.
In Turkey and the German people of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed to have died some time ago, since fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing Turkish background.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobic in Germany.
The discovered ultra-directist network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were neither, nor much less, predictable.
"Are you going to rehabilitate the bleeding ideology?", entitled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the contrary, points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Constitutional Defence Office and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-directory panel.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted compassionately, and the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a look at the Brandenburg Port.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Conviction was staged with happy colors, such as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a gift: "The German gift for the fifty-year anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Have X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German "Hürriyet" emission also does not insist on this mental connection.
"Start looking bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that the killers were persons who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction work.
In the online forums of Turkish origin, the conduct of the police and their subsequent success in the search are very critical.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought much before suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Someone is less rhetorical about the media: "From now on, the immigrants are lost, they are left with nothing but self-defence and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of clarity and the appropriateness of sanctions across the network," writes "Selen".
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is at risk, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in nine years.
The image of the destructions of Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish monuments.
No other event made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a particular threat and, to the Germans, that lack of confidence and distance can result in violence.
The attacks echo the feelings of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In Turkey's press, then, mainly criticised the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen sent a peace telegram to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced it at the Colonia funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, since then, the lack of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time there is a lack of frank words.
The Bank of the Zurich Lake scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The BB almost got into a bank account in the financial crisis and since then a crisis has emerged.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After its spectacular departure from the top of the federal bank in July, it was known that in 2013 it would start in a new and almost spectacular work: President of the executive board of the large Swiss bank BB, an unexpected and lucrative step in its course.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, commends Switzerland for its beauty and to the BB for its recent acquisition of stability and leaves favorable comments on their future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to work with Kaspar Villager and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and defended EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The president of the USB Administrative Council has since been considered equally touching, and they have all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank from February 2012.
And there will be the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, an economic teacher and adviser and has had a period of adjustment which is certainly necessary.
A bank's strategy, which has just proved worthy of the title "the largest bank in Europe's scandal" since then.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently it was the world's largest real estate administrator, and on the other hand, for years, it has emerged from a scandal as follows.
Nothing, it seems, is protected by such a proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss real estate administrator was discreet and solid but also generous, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's largest banks.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, former banker and postgraduate bank professor in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, he went out to the light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director General, who has so far been considered a great and very intelligent banker, has been surprised.
A few months later, the reason was questioned.
The Bank's investment fund was in losses with high-risk securities and had to amortise thousands of millions.
To charge this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13,000 francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some would look with contempt so much earlier: an Asian and opacious state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, which had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it collapsed.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions of dollars, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006, in the second best paid Administrative Council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the BW was in the financial crisis before the drought and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to BB billion, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became a co-ownership of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was said that this was the dramatic thing for a small country, if it resides in such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet balance was more than five times the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the U.S.," said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first disaster united the second.
A few months later, the U.S.B. got caught up in a tax conflict with America and was willing to deliver data from advanced clients, which may have been taxed with bank assistance.
In addition, it approved a figure of $780 billion, reimbursing of the illicit profits of these businesses with a payment compensation.
As a result, the BWB acknowledged that it had contributed more or less to tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the aureol of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the draft directive and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through miscellaneous speculation and in the administration of goods by aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was going to be a bit quieter, just when it was thought that the BB was getting it again, it happens this decadent story of the operator, an individual operator spent 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was discovered that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Aboboli it appears that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finance at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of BW is that it does not dominate risk controls".
As a result of the idea of caution, with which Swiss banks have been present for a long time, they are the guardians of the world's largest assets: no too high risk, on the other hand, of money security wants to break away on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of infrared reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The centre of the BB in Zurich does not match the click of the Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, marked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are rugged, the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Here there are joys such as Tiffany`s among Swiss traditional businesses such as the Springli Conservatory.
The Swiss banks have lived here for many years: from the national bank, passing through the House of Credit Switzerland, to private banking elites such as Julius Bär.
It enters the BW reception room through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, there are large leather cylinders, along the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate "security".
The BB knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, BB and Credit Switzerland, have at some time moved the idea of the great Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and at the end, as all Swiss banks, as well as the business of both large banks.
The BW has become too large, it is thought, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxies have won land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been accustomed to English customs for a long time."
In fact, the Bank changed the English investment bank, gave its first large profit and then the disaster came, no European financial entity had lost both money in the high-risk jungle and the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "Der BHB-Crash" ("The Crash of BHB" in Spanish).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the bank.
How do they happen?
Talk to the Swiss banks, so see the problem in the BW dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks were merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too large for the little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different TBB forward banks: a rich but sleeping bank with the property management centre in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalised investment banks came in time with a lot of money, which could make a big financial cycle run.
There are two names related to this rise of BB: Peter Wuffli, head of the BBF ' s association from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition that made it open from learning in the bank to the top."
Finally, Ospel became Wuffli.
And finally Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "I thought their models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The desatino arrived before the case.
The employees of the BBB clearly agree with the meetings of directors, where Wuffli, the head of the Consortium, always repeated the same theme: Lowering the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The U.S. wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In the currency operations and in the negotiation of actions, it was at the highest level.
However, business advisers highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
The U.S. mortgage products are empty.
In order to fill these gaps, the BB started an adventure that almost cost him his existence.
The same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in US high-risk investments were invested.
He turned into a powerful machine to title American mortgage credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to his own account.
And also, like other banks she'd been looking for the down for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the US real estate market was in flames, the BB bought there," said Geiger, a bank expert.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
TBB posts have been converted into projective seats and are not safe until now.
At present, someone who runs a large bank has a job that is almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea to end the investment bank, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get so far (yet).
But the investment bank must be much down, it's clear right now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian Swiss was thought to be a transitional solution, since the bank was suddenly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
However, he insisted: The business of the U.S. has to be conducted permanently, the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to his state investment bank in mid-1990s.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But that's not enough.
The BB needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does he want to earn money?
These are the questions that are sure to be asked by Axel Weber right now.
Until now she just says she'll first find a home with her wife in Zurich.
The next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the United States

The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek vase has been seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are going back to a first plan, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial assets are included in the sales list.

Europe cannot be set free so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, just confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, said in an interview for the CNC.
Therefore, from its point of view it is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it takes on board a decade of old principles and enters the United States technological sector.

Intelligent graces extend in cities
In many places graces are considered "problem birds": these intelligent animals from cities are not expelled for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the graces belong for years to the city's image, but in many municipalities the complaints of neighbors are collected for the hunting and hunting of animals.
Although there has been no means against the "problem birds" so far.
The graces don't leave the cities anymore, say experts at the first season on graces in Leer, East Frissia.
There experts from all over the national territory are discussing possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grasslands; chemical applications in agriculture have apparently ended with traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the growing construction and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The degrees are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 players in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northeast, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to kill in mass at district level was launched to the negative owners of the press.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by means of trappings for birds and killing with bullets as particularly brutal.
"When they are excommunicated and settled normally nothing gets done," Werner Klöver, a citizen and landscaper from Leer, expressed.
Shooting with water or throwing down trees are often undesirable consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Adjusting them is only imaginary as an exception in hospitals, old-age homes or colleges.
"We have to live with them, we don't arrest them anymore."
Without the environment, the problem is not solved in the cities, according to Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
It is possible to adapt to sensitive and deaf habitat animals so that they can be reunited elsewhere.
"Intellectual panels instead of chain holes" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist makes advertising against animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can get a tip on the face with applause."
Jürgens buried in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's graces, where letters tell about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of birds' noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the graces not only use resources to access sharp spots, but they do not need tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University checked in four degrees until the intelligence of birds is reached.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to let a stone fall on a platform to reach a pool.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, graceful habits should solve a complex problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a polylllar blade in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their grip with the pizza.
But the researchers left them a piece of apple.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube trigger.
Three of the four degrees achieved it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Christian Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The preferences, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Guided by the triunfante hero Christian Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal went to Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1), and, after the 0-0 of the Ida party, made the following five Eurocopa participations.
The Czechs obtained 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs turn party with the Montnegro outside, after that in the Ida game (2-0) they said the clear things.
Croatia did not allow it to be marked on 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland received a 1-1 (1-0) flow against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) marked the other goals of Portugal.
The former professional of the Bundeslaga, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a fine (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) cut off twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a red card (54).
Bosnia failed due to Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Luz de Lisboa Stadium, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo performed a direct release of more than 30 meters to put his head on the points.
A quarter hour later, Nani showed his skills to mark from a distance and reached 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn't shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the gladiator Edin Dzeko.
The former player of Wolfsburg's team, leader of the English Manchester City, sent a head to the stage, but the balloon did not cross the porterial line (33.).
Jiracek confirmed for the Czech Republic
Next, the colleague Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Penitentiary, he decided to show the Portuguese amarilla card for taking it to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark asked for a rival criminal after Fabio Contrao's action, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-president clarified everything with 4 holes.
The checks ended with the last doubt at the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's bullet.
The 1976 European campaign is for the fifth consecutively for Eurocopa.
The team of trainer Michal Bilek with the legendary Bundesliga Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also successful and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible hole in its own port of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with both Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the turning of the front, very just at the port of Cech.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the length of the world fame port, the front of FC Seoul returned to escape (50).
Finally, the goal before the end was to condemn the game.
In the meantime, Turkey took no advantage of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0 to 0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat on the World's Third World Ballet in 2002, Croatians held their fourth participation at the end of Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium, the Turks almost got a start of the study.
In the minute seven and with a long shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to send the balloon inside the portal either.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let them put any bullet in it.
Together with Mario Mandzükic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took place in Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Daniel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) at 62nd minute are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish hold their first participation in Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who graduated with the 4-0 in the Ida game prepared for a previous decision, was put to the head at the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) was impressed with the team.
Ireland was under pressure from the beginning, but he had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big opportunity.
Since the first time, the defence has avoided possible wave of advantage.
But at the 32nd minute he made it.
After a defense from Porter Pavel London, Ward appeared and dropped the balloon through the line, achieving 1-0.

Mask to Personal Level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatism of the type that can make one's soul fall to its feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page slowly and convert it into your bookmarks page.
He will come to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelist narrative, and this dramatic person will work as his GPS, a hero during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and disappointed in the blackness of the war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you wrote here is a little current book, which describes, certainly, as "an anti-historic work".
It contains some significant names, important treaties or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not as much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feels, impressions, experiences and moods".
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines experiences in times of war with more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanicals to scalers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, lose their members, return to their places of refuge, or die.
Their lives here appear like candles burned in a church; some new ones add to the mixture while others close.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the books of standard history.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the most sinister war in the West.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall upon the hills; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intrepid problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war burns the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that bites at the heart.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Course of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conceptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of conspiration, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" continues to individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained in most of their memories, letters and other material already published earlier.
The explanations of your lives may be terrifying or moving, but they are more filled with life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and settlement with what is available.
About telling the story of a German college, he says, "Succedane us, all over the world."
"Successary of coffee, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
She keeps talking about the Swedish food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and printed in lean meat fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried potatoes and pastries; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, note, "837 meat-producing substitutes, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse to saveism and manifests about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is why men are designed and not to sit on chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a best sealer, and pretend that that barnitz means civilization and that there is no barbarous behind that dirty and tachyoned lock."
Instead, a British soldier is aware that he will probably die and that no one will be buried or imported.
"When one refers to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that could happen before the public," he writes.
On the contrary, it looks awfully like "to a convict being estranged in secret".
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
Reflect on the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the pet of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced killer with good-confession clothing that executes his pet while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unexpected ways; there are both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who were actively trying to catch up with a venerable sickness of prostitutes as a way to avoid the service in front of them.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the Gonococic trade, which soldiers buy and exchange with it their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are really desperate will throw it over their eyes, which often leads to a blind eye for life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agli but not extravagance, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way the war was "extremely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as the Great War and Paul Fussel's modern memory, or novels like No news in front of Erich María Remarkque, instead of comprehensive history.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins in a little conventional pattern.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if you had come from your book, started from between your fingers that page of dramatic characters, and burned it with a candle.
After a false move, a scheduled move in minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying out anti-disturbing cases.
Monday night was selected on Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officials, initially telling others that they were joining in an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence undertook how the operation was affected by difficulties for the police department.
The recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the pulverization of pimentant spree on protesters, violating department rules and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupas".
And that's why the police operation to evacuate the Zuccotti demonstration park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared to see how jobs in other cities had been developed.
A major disaster simulator was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures involving rapid mobilization of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan in the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at "the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few police I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to leave the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters appeared shortly after they had heard about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces throughout the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been coming and coming from the park during the day, making it a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the least number of people in the park," he said.
Cars of the Emergency Services Unit with focus and loudspeakers were gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-embarrassed messages from the loudspeakers seemed to frighten many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue cuts, many demonstrators simply collected their things and were.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other staff were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if there was a need for detention in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they were trying to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated badly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved to the west through the dense range of personal effects of the protesters, including paper and plastic trash bags covered by clothing, the crew of the Cleaning Department followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp epicenter were moved between them by their arms.
And two people fell into trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut off candidates.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The decommissioning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were "change of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The highest rank officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's detectives, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while I was present, "I wasn't conducting operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, if they had to enter.
They were set up on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most brutal action of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5 A.m., south of the Pine Street, a protesters jumped over the head of a police car, and others were seen taking off the air from the streets of a police van.
At a given moment, a piece of fighter went out flying from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a demonstrators were hospitalized.
The union of workers of support will ask the city for requests from the dissidents
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month is planning to ask the city for Wednesdays, claiming that the dissidents were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools belonging to poor students.
The claim is, possibly, the latest weapon available to the union in municipal district 37 in its effort to revoke the dissidents.
Sixty-six hundred and two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees among the city's worst paid persons lost their job on 7 October, in a movement described by union leaders as a political advantage because of their refusal to allow, the past spring, access by the city to a health assistance fund for working groups to close their budget breakdown.
Municipal authorities have categorically rejected that charge.
In an audit in the Board last month, educator Dennis M. Walcott said that the candidates were part of the approved budget in June.
A member of the Council objected to saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be dismissed.
Municipal district officials said they had submitted the claim in writing, notifying the Department of Education that they would be required. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The application will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, with eight dismissed workers as applicants, all black or Latin women, as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman from the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific claims.
According to a spokesman for The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dropouts in the schools of poor areas in the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools have lost more assistance, since they have been insufficiently subsidized in a chronic manner.
It is noted that although she had not been expelled in Staten Island and a few graduates in the Upper East Side or TribeCa schools, 17 school attendances lost their jobs in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were expelled in the 8 and 9th districts in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight staff members employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim says, "This is not a neighborhood of grown-up parents who can raise funds to cover the budgetary deficit."
P.D. District 36 budget fell by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated additional funding for each poor student matrix in schools.
The trade union also claims that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that permits parental coordinators to issue.
The memorandum used the word "excellent" to describe the action, although "excellent" more often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school's nominee to a job bag whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty and six parents coordinators were dismissed," said the complainant, "and not only in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally the Republicans and Democrats in the Chapter are ready to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that Veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed and that the United States' participation came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution sponsored by President John Kerry (Democratic by Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Republic of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (dependent on Connecticut), commending the libiers for their successful rebellion and United States troops for their "validity".
"This resolution is to honor the Libyans when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It's a statement of bipartidist support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought against each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of U.S. military personnel in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Chamber by a broad bipartidist margin, which never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the camera also rejected a measure that would have reduced the funds for United States operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative cleaning - with Congress it's rather complicated as to criticise Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually follow the grass under his feet.
Next, the decision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "encourages the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to self-defence" and "delegation to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their companions of the coalition who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya by their extraordinary strength and professionality".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide legislators as the draft law of June did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the main republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet.
On the other hand, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlette (Virginian Republic), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other matter that actually results in a vote of all the Assembly in the Chamber or the Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful until now in order to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of attempts.
Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance so only in the Chamber, and another suggestion that "it will control federal expenditure."
Some of these bill projects are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially the new republicans who seek to define their curriculums - the opportunity to celebrate that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required that both the Chamber and the Senate vote for an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of the amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can carry out, while the representative of José E. Serrano (democratized by New York), wishes to remove the two-level mandate for the Presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other matters.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits gang fire.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving to a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and presented 66 at 110th.
The rate is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990s when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they do now.
The last amendment which was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Gold but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first interview on TV since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to death in a constitution-making act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television the night of the moon, sang along with Broadway's melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance at ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and damaged the left side of his brain and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he went back to the House surprised to issue his triunfant vote in the debt cover agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and killed 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, " Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" for an hour, which was released the visper of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos written by Kelly in the first weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her hair shaved and a long scar through her face.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband is alive.
Months later, he comes to Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A fracture of lips.
And then, his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "stitched", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: It comes to the congressman singing along with the therapists "Girls Just Wwana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spent two hours each day on therapy, said he didn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of 12 March when she stopped to ask him for the first time about the six who had died in the accident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being treated by the force while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Dear, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So I told him, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've only been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get back and go back with more strength than ever."
The troops make me feel more light than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gale that cost millions of dollars for veterans without a home in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ball about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, mariners, planes and marine children broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood and cried out.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the recovery of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the galley, also known as the then president of the United States, Mr. Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as a sort of orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
Of course they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Remarkably contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and a U.S. public at times.
The troops are produced with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if those uniforms are being punished.
"We are not victims at all," Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland said, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of disunited souls."
The issue is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear unappreciative or inconsistencies with the public to whom they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in recent years in the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on the laity are conducted in silence and in private between war veterans.
After their two children returned to fight Marina's Infantry, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his search for employment, he said he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtlely if he would be able to cope under the pressure of a Washington demanding job immediately after his fight round.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cancian reminded his children.
It is the military concern, in part, of the United States independence towards war.
The achievements in the field of battle are rarely selected for the praise of a country with little familiarity with the military and see little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in ways common in the Second World War," General Lieutenant David Barno, who ordered U.S. troops in Afghanistan, said.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of cycles they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army because of their alleged passiveity before the rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said he was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he headed back to his quarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12-page beer package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to take a drink.
"It was a signal of alarm," says Lyman.
However, Texas's native left behind his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"Oh, I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached behind him, dragged her down and raped her, he says.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military staff are anxiously awaiting a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request they have filed against the Defence Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will be brought to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce generalized military violations, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 applicants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their partners, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or providing adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going for the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure up to the bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to misguide the culture of repressives? The high order."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom may be part of future claims.
Its strategy: Instead of collecting all applicants in this case, by placing all the eggs on the same table, it is therefore going to present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, provide details of the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be called upon by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
The Federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service by the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the applicants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: among these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in war situations.
It's time for the army to modernise too, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, besides her.
At Yale Law College, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academys for the alleged promotion of a mission environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Viet Nam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "invasion of personality" assigned to the victims of violations with a view to giving them high service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the administration of Veterans, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way that the claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been sexually abused in the service were handled.
Nine draft laws were presented separately at the Congress by a bipartidist mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are markedly low, and by the very estimates of the Pentagon, which is estimated to be 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that took place that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the procedural indicators: in 2010, a 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were judged - half of them in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case described their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he accused the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times apart from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a kit of rape, and the blood of her aggressive--of a cut in her arm--was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, which was finally absolute.
"I remember the day the Verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work. I found myself crying out of the room."
"They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I left, I remember telling my command officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which did not fit in with the service.
In January 2010, the service was provided under less-que-honourable terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his petitioners continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Law at George Washington University of Law.
However, she said, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What interferes with them and a verdigo is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and frustration that it assumes responsibility.
And he adds, "Probability is strong against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go on its way, Burke, a lawyer from the applicants, will put his other hundreds of applicants in charge for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"The moment we move, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that would take its anti-immigrance points online.
Monday, Brevik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Brevik could have acted alone, he was far away from being alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time before his computer attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support rights groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We note that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report on European digital population by the British study centre DEMOS.
The Facebook personal information association is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with scientific precision - the way vendors have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then led them to ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arrival through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not of all surprise: Online right groups parties tend to be young people, men and irritants by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activity with online activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen".
The work of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends such as those expressed in "I like" messages on walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is creating an increase in research, encouraging the number of academic work with the name of the site in the title to almost 800 per cent in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you can't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that--you go straight to them."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its colleagues found that university students who spoke of their drinking habits on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problems with drinking than students who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as resident counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with his or her burrows.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Centre at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, said Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "painting" its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and San Valentín Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using information that can be accessed - defenders of digital freedom - long ago insist that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to keep your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of an investigation they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data online, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think that many of the users have even thought that an investigator could be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study carried out with the public walls of the students' Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information about a user's profile and the messages of the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two things completely different," says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject paper and a bibliographist are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," she says.
"Social research is supposed to be about society - and a lot of society is still happening out of line."
"Free and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance at the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the movement of Norwegian resistance and in the Norwegian Temple Horsemen," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I object to the court because it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports pluralism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't declare guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason he refused to allow Brevik, who gave a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Brevik under custody for 12 more weeks, forbade him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Brevik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was trapped under the lock.
They all attended with the aim of moving forward towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utiya survivor at the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark and black suit, Brevik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors at the eyes when he entered and out of the building.
Despite Brevik's strange notion that he was part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge decided that he was not a mental illness, and said there was no evidence that he would act with complications.
Some may be encouraged that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a radical group.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs lost interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in a recently discovered interview with Jobs, which has emerged as a result of a series of special projects in the largest markets this week, is how much this creative attitude towards the commercial processes and workflows of products was understood.
He was no doubt a self-recognitioned designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a Yonki of flow diagrams - a man who thought that many executives would suffer "a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the personal computer tree, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, Jobs had recently been forced to leave Apple, and he had worked hard at his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly re-edited, is based on Steve Jobs: The interview was lost in 68 minutes, which comes to the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating deep interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and trade strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly suspending his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where it seems patient because of Cringely's questions, prompting him to go faster on topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the computer.
One thing is to read post-assessment assessments of Job's career, but there is something hard and inspiring in Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the missing interview:
About how I learned to carry out a business:
"For years in business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" And the answers that give you in a way that's inconsequential are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes your efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Discontested by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of good copper, and then adapted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that would ensure that the commercial costs could be determined in detail.
About the joke to Dad:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and make calls far away for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here describes the Blue Box as an act of power is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT & T network to another, while creating a hole with as many satellites as possible.
"We were engaged in things around the world half a dozen times and cried through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone at the door of the side," Jobs says with a smile.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control something giant--it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think that Apple had ever existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two stood in custody just before the same Pope was awake to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling it by phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hewlett on the phone and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my view of what a company was and what good they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where I saw "the first desk computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small cathode tube screen, and I loved it.
I'd get a trip up to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About to improvise innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs is talking about inventing new products on the way.
Soon in his career, since he was dedicated to selling a basic plate bag, he asked a client if he could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agree to have dramatic arguments... they cried out to me that five years would be needed [to create a $300-dollar ratio], and I got hurt and I went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a rat that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
About big companies losing their strength:
Long before Apple was born, Jobs had prophetically predicted the way many industrial leaders would trove in their vision and lose control of their market share.
"Tell me you work in IBM or Xerox, so why do you make better photocopyers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so they are the kind of people who end up leading companies and product-leading people are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The gene of the products that led to this monopoly was cleared by people who did not have the idea of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have gathered from all the computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the victory defeat.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a huge amount of work between a big idea and a big product... as the big idea evolves, changes and grows."
It learns a lot about the subtleties of the same thing.
There are sacrifices you have to make -- some things you can't do to make electrons, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
Finally, everything is reduced to pleasure - you refuse to try to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things to what you are doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copied, the great artists stole.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What he did most to Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which were often the world's best IT scientists.
If it wasn't for the computer, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas eat with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at the closed door to consider the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health assistance law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were arrested in a course sponsored by the law firm that would issue the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the requests for review in a minute.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 states to challenge the total reform of the health assistance approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the application and, in fact, a historic plea of 5 hours and a half to March is expected, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be fully supported at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general tax during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated for many years to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another sign that sponsored the scene, Jones Day, was one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Among the participants was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a stated opposition to health care law.
The special guests at the dinner?
There is nothing new: The two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's nothing but conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, they could be said to fall under Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds for law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an guest of honor, or be included in the programme of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to warn ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges that the court enforces by the same rules applicable to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common case).
"The judges were arrested in a robbery of Gala funds with lawyers who had pending cases before the court."
Their presence and assistance in fund-raising for this event challenged any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say that the court's activities are too easily mixed with the agenda promoted by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Gini, is an outstanding conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Master Elena Kagan, who has a ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General of Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to avoid seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
Emirates Airport requires 50 double-pass Boeing 777 aircraft, with 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation worth more than a billion dollars.
It is rarely reported when a company receives a request from 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. aircraft and the sales price for 50 aircraft rises to a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future flight requests.
In a study on the moon, Chicago's company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its biggest request for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 of double passport.
The successful request came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would increase the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Dubai Aeronautics Hall 2011.
Then, Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which assumes a fuel storage and services for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they do not only have money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - generally harmful to air lines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with increasing oil prices.
That is important because they have less chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emiratos solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-scale fuse airship market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS on track to invade his domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory in the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it would delay the start of the largest A350, which is directly tasked with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the start to add more momentum after customers demand an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's actions amounted to up to $67.94 per cent.
The sister of the President of Mexico, who appeared to be defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón says the drug dealers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the container for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost her candidate to the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said the moons that drug dealers helped lead the career in favour of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results led to the front of the road for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of crime organized throughout the electoral process and, above all, alarming, not only for Michocán but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after Sunday's vote.
"They've added to our candidates, our electoral workers... they've been robbed of urine, set up bars... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The Government of Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valejo seems to have crossed a few margins to Calderón, who had led the investigations before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the Conservative Party of National Action of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for left-wings by the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, who is currently in office as governor, remained in third place, a great defeat for the left-left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, excalcide of the capital of the state of Morelia, refused links to drugs and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michocán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birth of President Calderón, and he elected Michocán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while he campaigned by Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of the disfavor that appears to be the election of Michoacán, a victory will help motivate the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year".
The BASD urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare themselves to help save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two major world growth economies had to "make everything possible" to speed up recovery of the economic blockage already through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observed Europe's difficulties in a "impaired" way and said that Asia's financial assistance together with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview under the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but can not be immune."
"So if China and India can help, whatever the means."
The European monetary union has been seriously hit by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last days, the cost of Italy's debt has been very high and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have declined.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to be united to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone because its own economy was now suffering from the decline in exports and the loss of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to keep a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to sell aid to Europe for thousands of two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point it will be taken that the Greeks are celebrating at the age of 50 and go on holidays on the beaches and that will not be good," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the many and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of mismanaged companies, and drivers of losses such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened with "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "risks of low" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "concentration plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outputs from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon on possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts accompanying them could undermine national security and lead to a financial reaction in chains from the Pentagon to the Afghan battlefields to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already approaching $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but it is now afraid of an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be minimal if Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "study", would result in 23 per cent global reductions and a high number of new projects.
"A large cut, applied in this discriminatory way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - three quarters of a ship or building cannot be purchased - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also see ourselves obliged to leave many of our civil servants voluntarily and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break the faith of those who keep our army and seriously damage the good will."
The cuts in time would reach the fighting troops, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartime periods in the accounts of overcrowding contingent operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war have been adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the contract supporting the war."
"Nominal personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers during the war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequences of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's major military power."
"We are firmly against this Dragonian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome that can live with, and certainly not one that we must impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls for the removal of the cuts from the Pentagon is to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, despite the fact that she has come to work at the Pentagon with years of budgetary experience at the Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a grim panorama of what might be ahead - an army with a knife, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an aircraft with not enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential opponents in the day."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presents new details on how reductions "will generate significant operational risks: stay in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and committed before the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the hack, including those already being tested and some only in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new coastal battleship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the Humvee.
The holding of F35 development and additional evidence could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view of the most recent headlines tells us when serious and unpresentable are deceit and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment charges with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the state University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for alleged hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually harassing children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "pillared" with an open microphone saying to U.S. President Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsions countries.
The congressman by New York and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made the joke with his fast-pained dissidents by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And once again, no one who lived him will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton denied during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The readings on the tapes in school and university exams are very extensive.
There have been cases where teachers have responded to students' exams with a view to being better viewed in their performance assessments.
Liers who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How stupid are we to find us?
One day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, many of those lies are fake lies.
Another study showed that unknowns lied three times in the first 10 minutes to meet.
To detect lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must acquire for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to declare: "I have you", the detection of the fraud is a branch of knowledge that would be based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades on prestigious universities that carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about lying have been debated.
The liars look at their eyes.
They don't always tartamud, balbuce, steal or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that lying people are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lies detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microphase expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about fraud in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of fraud is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include contracting, interviewing, or negotiating management.
The good liars have the ability to read well to others, to make them feel good, to manage their own emotions, and to feel intuitively how others understand them.
We know from research that extroverts hold more than introverts, that men say more "directed lies to themselves," while women say more lies "orientated to others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people tend to think less often to their spouses than those who are not married (but lies that they often say tend to be "great").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line."
Help to provide reference points to measure after changes.
Note the position of the subject, laugh and vocal features.
It's better to know if someone usually hits his foot all the time so that he doesn't make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting half of the meeting.
Then search for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
View these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of fraud.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body when trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, turn to an exit, change their position significantly or show a "post interview" -- that excessive breath of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have ended.
The questionnaires often fail to see that the interview has ended only to seek this post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put the floor down to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a search at national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when you answer a difficult question: "Well... tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer be a perception rather than a fact and is often a sign of caution.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover the fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by stage artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the oleoduct released after the threat of U.S. withdrawal in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the adoption of a oil pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- strengthening trade unions, while encouraging ecologists -- the company that seeks to build the oil pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said the moon by night that it would move the oil pipeline planned outside the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and he hoped that the project would win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada's guide, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that the oil pipeline is eventually approved, although it is true that it is with a different path.
This comes after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogalala waters, a vast subterranean water supply.
"This is a real road to progress," said representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review organized by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision by 2013, after the elections next year, although officials denied that the policy would be involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as requested by the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
The oil pipeline, 1,700 kilometres, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta's province to the refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have established by the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to oil.
However, the opposition legislators of Nebraska are upholding legislation to strengthen an eviction from the Sandhills region and the Ogalala water, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project had only had limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the Department-General had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interests for the programme.
The other is that a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is supposed to cause a child to scream
A New York family says that the sound of the disc music, Patti LaBelle, was acting like a place in the vestibule of his building in Manhattan, landing his little daughter to the point of falling in fear.
The diatribal of the singer "Lady Marmalade" threatened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so long as he suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers," says his family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when traumatist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of childhood garden, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk sat down on the wall of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his crew, taking to Geneva.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a while.
"Someone approached behind and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said to her, "Yes," and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
I had a bottle of water and started pulling the water out of the bottle on me."
He said that Genevieve had a history.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle progressed on the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and withdrawn from a car she was expecting, Roseanna Monk said.
The little one was crying so hard that he blew up, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking LaBelle for an apology, but I didn't get an answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBelle did not return their calls to comment on what happened.
The claim seeks non-specific damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family planned to give all the money that was given to support children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a child's garden teacher who carries a child 18 months of age."
Climate aberration the economy
During Mario López Valdez’s first year of management, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, under foreign investment and the economy is opposed
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, named for the change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate uncertainty of the beginning of the year, growth is not observed, but rather a deterioration is recorded in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions lost to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to increase, resulted in a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mainly justified by the decline in agricultural history of 31.16 per cent, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the Health Impact Report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused by 582 000 hectares of crops, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and 21.07 per cent of the remaining part damage, the main crops were cropped from vegetables, corn and wheat.
The decline in economic activity has resulted in a constant increase in unemployment in the state by November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in the first three trimesters of the year, an accelerated increase was observed, since between January and March 55 000,053 signals were out of use, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average increased to 6.19 per cent, an increase of more than 74 thousand unemployed persons, with an increase in the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Minimum liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS School of Economic and Social Sciences, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been taken since public policy.
"What is seen is an increase in unemployment which has to be seen with a number of factors, including loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the convention to combat money laundering, since it is not easy for people who illegally take dollars to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entering, and secondly because they are already having many difficulties finding work, these people are staying and are seeking sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment grow," he said.
Information
The analysis of the labour market was compounded by considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state without contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour wages are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5,000 352 weights, very below the national average, located at 7,000 375 weights.
IED Contract
As a result of the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest reduction in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years is recorded in 2011, according to the State IED Economic Secretariat from January to June was $630,697,697, which represents a drop of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143 000,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
On its part, the State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos per year, mainly from third-party companies.
The Debt
Before the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested the State Congress in July for the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would have been intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of revitalizing the economy, the adoption of the local convention was by a total of 2 billion million pesos, and until November no State economy debt benefits had been observed.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonisation of the will of the different sectors, including the Government of the State itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012, we have to double our efforts, we have to align the efforts of everyone and, above all, the well-known departure of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López showed that events such as the beginnings of the year held the state economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of several events, including the ice, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not return very quickly to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, by the end of the year, we are closing very much below our expectations," he said.
Redefined Call
For Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation Patrol of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it was clear that it was necessary to appeal to the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the state's vocation and economic course are redefined, because it is important that all potential of the material and human resource that has Sinaloa is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better shape Government's efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been working to deliver good results on different subjects, there are some progress on economic development but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow the Government to say that it is becoming more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They condemn him for 8 kg of marijuana
For five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a neighbor of Navalato was sentenced to eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his Mariguan possession variant for trade purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez street, in front of post 80, in the village El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was traveling in a pick up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the car's box and in the seat of the baby was a small mochila, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insurance was available to the District Second Judge and the judgment continued in the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Should contributions be made for work
Social works designed in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being closed or seriously delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda noted.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far been advanced, they are at risk of failing to comply with the State Government ' s contributions to which it has received a higher resource than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million weights, 25 per cent of which the State was responsible for, and that only the Federation and the municipality have so far provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the completion of these programmes is ongoing.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring and even though the year is to end has not given us a fifth, when since July we've had to share," he said, "we've started the work and we're going to make a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover more than 7 million people who did not then receive State administration.
"It has happened to us in the previous generation because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year to be able to access these programmes we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villalarreal, to appreciate the management so that the percentages corresponding to them could be reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring and even though the year is about to end has not given us a fifth."
Valid cut "analogous apangon" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) assessed the constitutional disputes that had interrupted the Senate and the House of Deputies against the presidential decree that led to the so-called "analogous apangon" from 2021 to 2015, unless the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his terms of reference by issuing a decree detailing the actions to be taken to mark the transition to digital television on the ground.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed by failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or constitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared constitutionally void, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes in order to impose the decree, and upon the admission of applications, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The Plenary of Ministers also decided to dismiss the request submitted by the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, as well as under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his intervention, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in that the Federal Executive could not structure measures for public administration to be prepared.
"I also do not consider that if it were to do so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would correspond to the Federal Executive, who has constitutional mandate, to the State's sector.
Replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and is translated into better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
To delay the change, I believe, would be to further the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, " require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, to include a group of tasks which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that when the Executive issued the contested decree, which somehow invaded the sphere of Congress's competences, since it was being provided in the administrative area, compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative was ensured.
Analysing the possibility of a "vote by vote" content in Michocán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governorial election is only 27 per cent, although the corresponding votes to 879 of the 6,000 74 total acts are not recorded.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" content is a reality with regard to the electoral process of this year in Michocán, where according to data from the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governorial election is only 27 per cent, although the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts are not recorded.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Microacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de las Angles Landeres Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a number of lines with a view to harmonizing local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, whenever the Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in this electoral process, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel ignored its publication within the deadlines set out in the Act of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative authority and qualified as "unofficial and illegal" the vote of the State mandater for constitutional reforms, as long as he does not have the right to "canonise or destroy them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de las Angles Landeres stated that, thanks to the approval of the corresponding lines by the IEM General Council, it would be possible to carry out partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in the assumption that: the results of the acts do not match; there is no record of excrutinity and computer in the case of the shipper or is not open to the President of the same case; or, where there are evident errors or changes in the acts.
In addition, the total report of the vote received in all ballots may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate alleged winner of the election and that the second place in the vote is equal or less to one percentage point; always and when the representative of the party and/or coalition were present at the beginning of the meeting, the request expressed by the representative of the party and/or the candidate indicated.
The total vote may also be taken if, at the end of the ordinary computer, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner candidate and the second candidate is equal or less than one percentage point, whenever there is an express request by the representative of the political party whose candidate has remained second, where the electoral packages that have been subject to partial account will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation, the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of the 923 total are not recorded.

Three men were found murdered by bullets in different parts of the body and with the arrow of grace, in a abandoned fine of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, New León.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed in that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the Italian President to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has threatened the whole eurozone.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a Government.
It is expected that a office composed of most of its technocrats will be present, although it is not clear when it will assume the new executive.
Monti said he would present the outcome of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The mark is now well-designed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs at unsustainable levels.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a strong package of austerity required by European leaders to recover the broken confidence in Italy.
By raising the pressure on Monti to be taken, market instability placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds to more than 7 per cent over 10 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were obliged to be rescued.
Emma Marcagaglia, the head of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We say we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly motivated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi PDL party, to whom the crisis forced him to leave on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good outcome," said the press, Angelino Alfano, secretary of the central party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of the majority of technology that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support for the implementation of what is likely to be unprecedented austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was pressured to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth organizations and women.
She'll end her round of meetings tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would decline, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current financial defences of the euro area.
Monti has said that his Government should last up to the next elections planned for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are advanced.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the large parties insist that they should be formed only by technicians, an indication of their repairs to a process under financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties are making it difficult to include political figures.
The rose of the Spanish is higher than the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten are based on 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 calls came to the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friend at 3:05 p.m. in San José National Stadium.
While World and Europe's champions, one of the FIFA's monthly ranks, account for a wide range of Class A inter-election games, the Tricolor only has Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
That figure reached me the previous Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful British First League clubs hold an intense activity every year in league campaigns and home Cups, and high-level attacks on European Cups such as the Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated elimination of the Eurocopa and the World of Football was previously taken into account.
Turkish footballers, on the contrary, have a limited international rock in an area such as the Concaaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is from Archer Îker Casallas, who, on the previous Saturday before England (the fall of 0-1 in London) compared the register of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play before the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, who is a brainist in Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were also recognized last week by UEFA together with other centurions of the Iberian team, named Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's arite, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the century's number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Habi Alonso, 91; Fernando Torres, 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81; Andrés Inniesta, 62; Csc Fabregas, 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, they are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Brian Ruiz artillery, with 45.
After that, only five over the 30 matches: Keilor Ships with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson don't start yet.
The historical explorer of Spain is David Villa, 50 days old, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifteenth included the country in its two decades of betrayal
"Going to Costa Rica is a real dream."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Amen of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that they will also be able to turn the dream of playing in the country into reality.
So the founder and founder, Jeff Amen, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American branch of its two-year work cycle and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelina The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, it's a real dream that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what they're living in?
To go to Costa Rica is a real dream for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been in Costa Rica once and for holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can stay there a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the previous days.
What do they say to their most zealous followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened during the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in São Paulo and we hope that this has put us in the shape of this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we are very anxious to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to survive?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a big friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to go; that's how we got together, through people who love surf.
Seeing the turn, they've come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never been there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we took a while not to touch, that keeps us focused and also surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked these songs and that we could have forgotten them.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this round, they're celebrating 20 years of betrayal.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
Firstly, I think none of us would imagine that we would be in a big rock band and that having done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and it makes us feel a lot that we can continue to do music together.
We all love and love creating music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that big band.
We're very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes up from a group of friends and it's a little bit common.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them once and for all.
Last year, we were at a party with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in her circle, so we were lucky to be friends of all of them still and we were honored to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like you will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Camero) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, all of us are worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical adventures have also been opened that give each one the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and can't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do they find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too round because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowd and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what you wear, without being caught up in being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Good project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was really great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most important that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or I saw a photo thinking about the incredible person Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a wonderful human being, and we were surprised.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why they chose it for opening it?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we most liked, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer alive and should be very contented.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are its influences?
That's it.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much I could talk all afternoon about the Bajirs who love me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the granny relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think that all of us always feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that happened at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now he has become more positive.
What is this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may look more livia, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is reintroduced again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in the legs, he informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffered several diseases, including cancer in the language for which he had been operated four times and was kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguyuga, who is your personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength from its lower members.
Aguyuga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the victim for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he knew it was innocent.
It has been operated four times by cancer in the language, has a weight loss of 18 kg which has been associated with other pathology such as severe gastrointestinal disorders, pancreatitis, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and blood circulation problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 by the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons in the hands of an army amplification squad who worked clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday with a view to expanding trade between both nations and addressing political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet the next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, at the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda extended by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in Guadalajara City, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations," the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French mandater Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of fiscal paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the international community from those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused Uruguay's refusal and its call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group composed of the most powerful and developed countries in the world since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information with a view to avoiding double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to accelerate the establishment of tax exchange agreements with a view to leaving the Organization ' s "green list" of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigotudo fountain is the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the battles of evil Bowser, but has never done so in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to shops all over the world this month, has been designed from a principle to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without having to use gafas.
"Mario is the person who has to say how the wireless stereoscopy should work," advised Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally intended for that support", since so far successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's voice has claimed that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and flowing game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "scilla" to trap the less experienced users.
Once over, the most experts can give a "second turn" to game levels, which this time presents more difficulty.
In addition, users may choose in real time between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not to succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional super Mario competition also involves the return of the person to a portable console, which has not been carried out since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes fun of the followers of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of the previous shipments, which is that the source of the bigote will have to run high-risk platforms with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news on the movements, the environments, the frustrations and the enemies and also a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom appreciates Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he had taken over the extradition of ex-computer Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the $70 million bath.
It thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request from the country of the north that it appealed to Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was subject to the independence of judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He noted that during his mandate he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and transmitted it to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited by murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes, both by drug trafficking.
The fact by Colom implies an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional courts have been seized to process the extension between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was denied the loss of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently available for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance an act held in the old Fabra and Coats factory complex to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vela in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, no work, no dogradation problems or in a situation of marginalization.
The meeting yesterday in Sant Andrew focused on a large number of responsible entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association for the past 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, they attended the event with the ex-consulter of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Goma.
They also invited the current Advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that it is now too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President appointed Trinijove as an example of being able to fight bad conditions and giving people hope with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it is doing," he said.
Dissociate an occupied finca where macrofiests were made
The invasors had assembled from 11 of the 13 buildings in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left the fine on the average yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the pesadilla that lived near the 51st of the Balmes street has reached its end.
Twelve people left the morning afternoon voluntarily the property they had illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofists who looked forward to the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from re-examined.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The occupations, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are living - took all the electrical installations and parts of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially sides of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multi-tudinal festivals, which lasted for two days and were desperate for tenants.
On the side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has decreased by 80%.
The discotheque owner points out that the invasives of the finca gave him unfair competition, since they sold the cups to three euros, while the discoca is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the host area had had to respond to neighbors' complaints by noise, while, according to the point, the disturbances did not cause customers of the discotheque, but the residents of the busy house and, above all, the party attenders there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the nearby neighbors of the area.
The discotheque officer explained that the disturbances were so large that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgive him" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the association, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately remove the real estate to end the problems of convergence and civilization that are causing neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular director explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the building occupied, but for the last few months the occupations had gone into all the buildings and almost all the floors, and that in some way thefts had been produced.
In this sense he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be satisfied with the incisiveness that has been generated in the prison".
Also yesterday, the Mossos left a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four persons had entered the building.
The four were arrested right now.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of summoning beyond honours
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
As of the 80s, with full support from the already extended Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed some of Collserola's promotional passports.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
It was also accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Neo-Yorquin Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was once again in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who are not heading the north-south but up (mountain) - down (Mar).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is summarized in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the assembly called for a megacompetition consisting of 16 competitions for other so many ports of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question is alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, by its mere organisational verifier and by which it is supposed to reflect on the city, is the subject of conversation between all Barcelona architects.
It's almost a recurring issue when two members of this former election are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is just one of the few similarities between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have presented.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is an opportunity.
For Rollan, after addressing the litoral front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", whenever the talk of Ildefons Cerdha, the green manganese, has not been carried out.
"It comes from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect sentenced to whom the title of "Collserola doors" means a "Lexical trap": there is no need to think of them "as access to a park, but as delimitation of areas where action is to be done".
Module, such as Rollan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, defines the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "insure that it's today to design public space" after the experience of the 80s and that it was in the Forum area "his side of the chain".
The first fear is the delimitation of certain borders where they can be built.
"Limiting something is already the next step," that is, its excess.
"It is important to think about new urban planning instruments because the current [in relation to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More sensitive to the question, Modol believes that by simplifying, the Vallesana verdant of Collserola "can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, no", for a matter only topographic.
The module recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not fall into chaos," although it appreciates the opportunity that the assembly offers its team to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
And more, I understand that the approach of the mountain with the city is the saving behavior that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is what should lead multidisciplinary teams ("all a certain" point) that have been created: "Architecturals should be only one tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the competition there is a lack of a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions -dece - in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no lengthal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This, at least in its case, has led to the choice of participating in the 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one of the doors can strike in program and definition with the architecture of the side door.
In its opinion, yes, the assembly should ensure that the franca immediately higher than the Dalt Round should, throughout its extension, provide for an area of equipment that would carry out a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will leave free
After 72 days of trial, casino Red's legal appeal granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged chants
After staying in prison for 72 days, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal governor of the Casino Red gives him an apology before the District Criminal Judge, who follows a singing process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas reportedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the regional settlement would allow the clandestine operation of the post office.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Panist Alkaline brother and was arrested and tortured for 30 days on 2 September.
Four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Barrio de capital of the State.
There he remained for 49 days after ordering him to withdraw a second order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs has dismissed the crimes of collection and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison reportedly for singing with one and a half million weights to the owners of the Red Casino; however, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security prison because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be brought before the Secretary of the District Criminal Justice, Jorge Yánez, who said that for almost two months of adjourned evidence was sufficient to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the cost of 1.5 million pounds to the representatives of the posthouse in exchange for allowing the operation.
This month, Casino Red's legal attorney, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appealed to Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize for the brother of the region's mayor; so he could recover his freedom in the next few hours.
During legal duty, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the post office had granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to book the name.
On the basis of the letter of 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim may be made on the basis of the subsequent proceedings; in addition, no damage or punishment will be required for him.
After hearing the legal appeal of the post office, about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
Judge Jorge Yánez was transferred to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his messenger will be archived.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more persons
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven more persons indicated that the helicopter was directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the departure of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contact with the ground, the asps had contact with trees 25 metres away where the unit lost the fossil. "
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so he counted on the requirements for transportation to staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with appropriate requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the Secretary ensured that it was a priority to count on the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take several months, even one year.
On his behalf, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State was operating at a speed of crossing and that this happened in an ascending direction.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cross operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautics, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, which meant that the crew should have visibility during flight and land.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the ICM placed appropriate conditions for withdrawal, as advanced by the aircraft to the DF-State of Mexico, low-level cloud layers were presented.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the conditions of darkness, the crew has sought a area of less elevation and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording of the radar aircraft are consistent, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows them to assume that the impact has occurred in a straight and side path.
The aircraft's waste disposal pattern allows us to assume that the helicopter was affected on the ground under structural integrity.
No fire-extinguishing evidence has been detected:
There are still no evidence in the rest of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been multiple contact with the land.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 000 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of tilt.
The photographs show the sequence in which it is likely to be disparate along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the minute search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no dispersal parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announce protocol to find obesity gene
Directs social security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) announced that it was conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, known as the protocol 'Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents', which would allow to count with markers associated with obesity.
In a communication, the head of the Biochemical Medical Research Unit of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been integrated.
This team is supported by postgraduate specialists from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestäst) of the National Political Institute (NIP).
The research is invited to participate in whether or not the population is entitled to attend the IMSS sports units participating in the Gulf of Mexico, where trials are carried out on minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He noted that the protocol had begun in the Cuahultemoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nizahualkóyolt Sports Unit (State of East Mexico).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Unit of Independent Sport (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Unit of Sport Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of degenerative chronic diseases.
At the World Diabetes Day on 14 November, the goal was to gather 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food issues.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and previous legacy of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
The Saturdays were applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the belt), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is subject to the concern of health professionals about alarming weight gain in children.
" Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 indicated that there had been an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in children within just six years, and 47 per cent in girls; there was also a dramatic rise in terms of obesity," IMSS expert noted.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was supported in that the country's population differed from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexico has 65 per cent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of Africans and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally obesity genetics are translated into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and stored in fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they are in some degree overweight or obesity.
In fact, he said, the presence of dark-colored (ancantosis) patches in the neck and front, indicating the likelihood of metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is managed confidentially, the doctors provide it in writing to parents, who are told about each of the measurements and changes in life-style that they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause obesity, obesity and other chronic disorders: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day sitting in front of the television and to use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of acidic beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgese, etc.) with high levels of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid fallings
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical College, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sending the floor were observed, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand wells per flood season in the Metropolitan Valley region of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the UNAM University of Chemicals (FQ), who ensured that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor process is the appropriate one, the wells could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely removed.
At its conference A technological opinion of the baches, based on the International Year of Chemicals, made it known that the laboratory at its task develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to that of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrra Najera believed that this type of modified waste could be used in areas where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of waste.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, one of high molecular weights, called asphaltenes, and the other of low molecular weights, called maltenos, which together give the floor its viscosity.
The viscose behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes fractured, added.
The previous means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but that it is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the expert in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them are covered by flexible floor coverings, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three are involved in the asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt folder, followed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that forms the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By passing vehicles and generating efforts, this allows forces to disintegrate very well into the floor.
If it was about modified asphalt, it would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt folder, it was enough to place a last layer called a rotary folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. an arena which is also bathed in asphalt.
As is the case with the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, there must be more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and distribute efforts, the rolling folder also requires proper thickness and the material of what is being done must be cared for.
The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is wet, the water is scattered inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this creates a reforestation of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of floors.
In the process of training a bache, he said, the first thing to waste is the film of rotation and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Investigators also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the training of decks and therefore the thickness of each floor deck must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that they are carried out, in order to avoid frequently falling.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example asphalt emulsion, which in other countries are already in the market and allow for easy repair and no need to use high temperatures.
What did you miss at the Valle candidate to be the new Mrs. Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that challenged Melina Ramírez Serna to not reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its princess's number 14.
Again the Valley of Cauca falls with the gains of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being on the winning podium, lighting the crown of silver and the band that they believe as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady was raised with the crown and crown, the department has already received 14 titles from Princess and Melina is one of the legend of Valecaucacan women who have been near the crown but who were princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Blance (1988), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many do is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favour that in each presentation she demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that received queens such as Italiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro who took the crown of Lady Colombia.
The first factor that is considered the key in the decision that took the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Street Leamos.
When asked about the volcano, she replied:
"Read too much, I believe quite much in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, and I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The Beginning", it's a pretty deep book.
Currently reading "Crime and punishment", is a universal literature book that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nimirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Blood Ward".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in concrete ways how each of the books quoted it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise beyond what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The beginning" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses fired is said to have burned it to Valle.
A bogotian journalist pointed out that after being the preferred, ovated and candidate to take all the preliminary prizes (Oster's gastronomy network, public vote for the best artesanal dress, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine in the stage".
And that was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom on the beach of Hilton and his two reflections on the coronation floor.
Although he was sure of success, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantics themselves.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the RCN Canal program "Like home", said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "makes it clear that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition does not remain queen".
In addition, Valle was shown to the last very wrong with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Belleza Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Dughty showed that they were looking for a committed woman with her parents' social needs.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before entering the Competition," he explained.
It is also estimated that Valle sinned because of his faults in the background and fibrosis that were noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury specifically selected him as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the most healthy body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens George Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth was not very noticeable to me, was down to her in the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine, believes that the failure of the Valecaucacan was the surgical intervention that was carried out.
"The surgeons are fine, but Valle is not supposed to do them.
His body was never his strength and here it was buried."
For this prize, which for the first time gives the National Belleza Competition, after the fall in the bathroom came up a vicious Vatican that was performed last night, because it was said that this was the pleasure Raymondo gave Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
In fact, whether or not, it is true that Melina has since begun a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international summits for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling through Cartagena, was mistaken.
So it was the work of the camel that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A bishop of Cali went through history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a CTI lobbyist from Cali passed through history as the man who confirmed the identity of the greatest chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the catheter of his digital needles.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, that week he played the "availability" tournament to Eliazar González, a 21-year-old man from Puerto Tejada who worked in the judicial research area.
On the start of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to enter the forest for more than five days to arrive at the place where the graves were to be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the hair of friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alphonso Cano's allies told Eliazar that he was wearing minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
The Friday night he went out to Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that he was suspected that one of them was one of the men who led the world's oldest warship, so he was asked to take Guillermo León Sáenz's Decadactial Card (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was found he did not recognize it because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beards, dressed as a camper in the area, without gloves and much more softer.
But the needles don't hold.
Along with a galtonian lamp, ink, a transplanter and a linterna, Eliazar compared the dental impressions of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming him to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who himself was the chief of Farcs.
Looking up the mirror
For a Dactiloscopist of the Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González in the press wheel by the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is an accurate science, without error, which can become the key to the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When captured, many criminals present false cedules or have no papers.
We take the dactilary impression and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he was moved to remove a wall piece of a house, since there the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to produce a dental impression, but in that case we could get the needle from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in several races," he recalled.
The needles can also disassemble or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Not long ago they found a dead man, with glass bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was found that a relative could be suspected of crime and that, in fact, a needle in the bottle matches.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, it is located in the scene of the crime.
A CTI Dactiloscopist explained that "the needles are removed with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a translator or tape is used to lift them up.
Following this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registry.
"The problem is there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches turns yellow.
However, if it can be used, if the relevant quota is made.
The "indigenous" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part took care of the landing order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this morning when they tried to enter again, under the protection of a judicial order, at Manhattan's square where they were deported from Tuesday and when they tried to take up another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allows the "indicted" to camp back in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the resignation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp back in the square, we will install ourselves somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the reporters of the movement "Occupa Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indicted" people to the departure of their camp, personally directed by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to remain in camp.
In addition, the "indigends" were engaged in the occupation of a new park located in the confusion of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least one hour they were able to occupy the place, but later the police listened and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the actual number, while he assured Ephesus that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved in support of the members of the movement and who have tried to communicate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a private property ring - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this deceased must be analysed.
Some of the protesters who have been displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that judicial order at these hours and even delivered them to the law enforcement officers who were keeping the square, which caused "some small confrontations", said Bray, who accused some officials of having attacks on the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from leaving the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws which were published after they started the occupation or prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used".
The mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the opening of space to the public and the protesters, who, however, warned that local laws would not allow them to re-install with camp stores and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction of the Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were conducted and which was decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was turning "in a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors had "on their quality of life".
"The resignation of this morning was absurd and shows that in the Bloomberg fund it is more interested in preserving the financial interests of U.S. workers than in the US," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
The "Occupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months during which the protests began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, you will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement", a "Baywatch", known as "Playboy", the wife of rock music Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Navigation.
The private CTV TV channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on the next 1st of December, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video home in which it appears together with his then husband, the "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting in a pregnant woman representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian comet of Indian origin who recently acted as a representative in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears like Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special CTV navigator has the Canadian singer Bublé, who finally married Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the U.S. Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan's rebirth after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the drop-down spiral that started in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still pervasive by the earthquake that has resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has plagued the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for the material losses of $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have been slowed down.
After three consecutive trimesters of fall, the date of the Gross Internal Product between July and September served to pass page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent at an updated rate.
The registered in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also proposes the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
Recovery is, in part, explained by the response of the purchase of machinery to restore the zones isolated by seed and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first retrocession after six months of uninterrupted interest.
However, the real revolutionary of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum that calls for the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the gaps to grow from zero.
Japan has, above all, woke up due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been commissioned to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "values of refuge" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and U.S. forecast turbulence, a privilege that weighs as a burden on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products become more expensive abroad, a serious return to a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the cost of the yen.
While markets continue to reside in the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda ' s Government is not under surveillance.
"You must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," stated State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had presented more recent signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator predicting the focus on the world economy highlighted that the main powers are being frozen.
Since it fell four decades to the 100.4 points, in front of the 100.8th of August.
The euro area, even below the average, which is at level 100, was precipitated by eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Atenas re-eats the doubts
We say the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment.
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to lag behind in the labyrinth leading to the outcome of the major European debt crisis.
The sense that the "consensual" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement decisions at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos advised when he opened a parliamentary debate tomorrow that would lead to a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the staff discipline code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not raise any doubts about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed nothing more."
The Conservative Leader was a further step in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athenians urgently needed, and made it clear that he would not give a good look at any letter of commitment to the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still suffering from the impact of the Papandreu referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without doubt and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek tree still has hilo for a mouse.
Ms. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "prepotent" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a pre-eminent place at world level in the role of Microfinances".
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has been converted into the second donor of the plant in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "existence" pointed out that it is a "a tool for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen opened the World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals by 2015 and, "very specially, in that which aims to reduce half the volume of people living with income less than a dollar a day, setting the "poverty threshold".
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and undertake this task with "responsibility", said Ms. Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", are the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many of the achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is raised not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of such households were left the poverty threshold in which they are subjected.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the beginning of the sentence years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, quoted Ms. Sofia as a "cause of justice and recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as "a wonderful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the land her loan policy.
In this experience he was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "I have all been able to see the continued evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of "family head" collected in Valladolid by the "poor man's bakery".
Finally, Ms. Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed countries ' governments should work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
On its part, the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, hailed "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding those who will close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its infected doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
On the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on the 14th of November in Leipzig, Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party had passed without great difficulties.
At first, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was put into practice in autumn, in particular to satisfy the military who consider the Government's policy to be too narrow with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, several hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhilate Minister of Finance, will lose any doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the movement, is summarized in a theme: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For Chancellor, it's time for Europe to open its way.
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also take place in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "face Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
No doubt, it seems unlikely that the twenty-first parties will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Concerned about calming souls within its party, the Chancellor has increased its references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has he tried to win his convention on the side of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticise the arrogant Germany.
Although the movement on Europe devotes an individual to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating victories for the Napoleonic army.
The incidence of fraud in the disease-producing countries
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government commit an offence against the poor by disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Burdeos on Tuesday 15 November to visit a responsible family allowance box and to give a speech on the topic, which has been in force since 2007, on the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to store in a strict manner, but still remembers an axis of the right presidential campaign, most want to focus on the poor by disease.
Firstly, in order to implement budgetary cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can take down.
Finally, unless a specific company agreement exists, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise an angry oil but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unemployment without pay in the case of low wages (to date, they do not have a disability, compared to the three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, most of them are re-setting the subject of fraud on the table as well, this time oriented towards the abuses of the labour base.
"There will be considerable increase in controls and, moreover, if someone is found guilty of fraud, he will have to repay the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the field of low labour.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and a number of offensive policies have been launched which have usually resulted.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us take note first of all of the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million was allocated in 2006 to low-working services.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, low-income subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, up to €11,300 million.
Of this, 46 per cent corresponds to maternal and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to the disease, a figure of up to €6,200 million.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off by disease.
Another study, in this case of Disease Insurance, indicated that in 2010 37 per cent of the patients had a duration of less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months, and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more suitable than in other areas to take down disease.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall unemployment rate (both for health and other reasons) in France, between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the poor by disease is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in the systematic control of disease-related diseases for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in a 13 per cent of 285,000 conducted, that short-term short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of those who were subjected to systematic inspections over 45 days, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustifiable; a figure which, having a total of 1.2 million, increased to 132.000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjusted" cases are reached among several million workers who contracted a drop in disease.
Without a doubt, a significant figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9000 and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies per year and, of course, much more than fraud in this latter area.
Papadéme: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémo said on Monday 14 November before Parliament; he also added that the hundreds of days that had been granted to his Government of Union would not suffice to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since "is in play" the country's sustainability in the euro area has been added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9 per cent" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing group, demonstrated his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not compromise with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that it was in line with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as the fight against the downturn, but against any policy that prevented economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of €8,000 million needed without a written guarantee of support from all parties to the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that assisted euthanasia and suicide should be legislated
Canadians live by refusing to die, according to the Canadian Real Society Report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by rejecting death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and take measures to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Real Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various areas, including ethics, legal and medical.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the patient is raised and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent study of the United Intelligence Economist that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada holds the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death".
With medication or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Canadian Real Society.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them just fell into the hospital.
In total, the highest rate in this regard is the register of Québec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not match the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, experts say that they have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they have not been considered a criminal offence has not caused abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non-compliant persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, stated yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that the fact of legislating euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of older or disabled persons have less value.
With regard to persons who have committed suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the criminal code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the palliative or terminal sitting, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be considered as euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already demonstrated their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of experts signing the report, among other things, because it is not limited to the practice of euthanasia for terminally ills.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now it adds that "in society there are labels and limitations".
Health specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which he qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Canadian Real Society, is particularly critical of the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus claims a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The participants from Bachar El Asad appeared before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad Syria was intensified which, with Russia's support, opposed and complained that there was a "computer" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, close to Syria, have shown favour of leaving power by President Asad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "reject power" in Syria, where a number of civilians and members of the regime have already fallen.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should also be allowed to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
On the other hand, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said to Syria, a neighbouring country with whom Turkey is increasingly adopting a position.
On its part, following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union, the United States has observed that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are increasingly taking a ton of pressure in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Dera region, in southern Syria, have already lost their lives, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSH) has announced.
Other two civilians have fallen "in the face of bombings and shootings with heavy artillery in Jobar" in the city of Homs, according to that NGO.
During a press tour, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers that the country "progresses towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has responded firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions, which, in its opinion, constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not flicker," he added, ensuring that "the troubles that have been dealt with against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that, in his view, is rooted in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to highlight the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides in particular for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has considered yesterday as "inaccurate" the Arab League's decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Mounting takes time for the markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time in the markets to train his team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility during the last few months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday, and today he met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office consisting of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a wide range of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the large small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
On his behalf, the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, without any doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the bourgeois markets and the obligors yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democraticism, there are times when it is necessary" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand it".
Its appointment by the President initially benefited the markets, but then concern was raised, particularly after a sudden decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily composed of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government will have to work until 2013, the date of the next legislation, consider.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working on the task, taking into account the urgency and the objective that Italy "recover its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has requested the adoption of new restrictive measures.
The "head of the Italian chiefs" Emma Marcagagglia, who will see her death, also stressed the need to push the economy, "because a country that does not grow can not meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousity" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the length of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some 200 million euros before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to a US NGO specializing in atomic risk Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Institute of Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
The IAEA expressed its "deep concern" last week by a "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on AIAA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Later, it was believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA stated that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of its career in that technology in the military programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while during the same period the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., by 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes has increased slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime and crime has again increased," stressed Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First takes a long time to point out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds an organization's officer, Paul Legendre.
"The United States Government can and should strive to end such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on hate crimes.
"Crime of hate" in the U.S. federal law inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed Monday's presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people who follow it, causing their service to appear a little more than Facebook.
A new "activation" tab and another "number" tab allow you to follow more legally and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those online whose messages "tweets" are on the Internet or they are following you.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you prefer any messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was proposed "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its functionamento poco instinctivo, with terms ligermento esotericos (RT for resending a message from another person, followfriday for recommending follow-up to another user) thus opens to a wider audience with a more comparable management than that of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users have debated how to hit "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and looks too much on Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The activity function will help me track down some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition which is in power in Austria has decided Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (Triple A).
It was the very Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reached 74.6 per cent, a very higher figure than the maximum 60 per cent fixed by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency is reduced at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay $3,000 million more in interest every year," said the Democrats' Vicecancillar of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of the past 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year and, since 2017, the federal government's structural deficit should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, while regional States, as well as the common ones, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong End
Notation threatens with a new intervention in the exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene on the mark of change if it continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that there is an excessive volatility" in the type of change of the yen, explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to a level close to the largest historical events that had taken place by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared with the U.S. currency.
But the yen has since been slowly retreating, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "value of refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to be reimbursed on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has descended under the 105 yen symbol bar, reaching levels close to those which have caused the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar contributed to around 120 yen and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it affects products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese companies when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (northest), Noda highlighted, who fears that the impasse of the Yen cut root is weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to an increase in exports and consumption of houses affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, which takes all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", understanding that it should not be expected to increase monetary flexibility in Wednesdays.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased by five billion yen (EUR 47,000 million) its purchases of Treasuren Letters, bringing to 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to inflate the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the boxes flake
The risk of contracting the debt crisis continues to damage European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European budgets fall slightly further in the negative area on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, CAC 40 loses a 1.4 per cent and is located at 3.064 points.
Dax loses a 0.4% in Frankfurt and a 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the most affected euro area loans, the world's burgeoning markets continue to be part of their recent gains."
"Invasive investors are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional driver at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Bolsa has closed with a drop of 0.7 per cent, renewing the concerns of market actors regarding Europe's ability to contain debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed vision in Europe and the exchanges will continue to be made in a limited range of variations, so investors will not have evidence that the situation has been stabilized," considers Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recovery of the concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a decrease of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met on Monday at the Congress, adopted a motion which, in particular, provides for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6% growth
The types of credit from Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations for 10 years reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the types of interests of the countries of the South, even France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being faced with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the market perspective, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The "spread" difference between the 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has reviewed the second quarter's figure below, with a reduction of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are planned at 11 o'clock after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must value more than dogs
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only benefit if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic evolution will support the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless it is a major part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a growing lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case in Belgium, which you are aware of the need to find a source of power to replace it, nor in Switzerland, which only aims to build centres of last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on its side, decided to add a unit to its park by re-establishing the construction of an interrupted centre following the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is presented on occasions as an example, the reality is contrary to such speech.
Berlin's election is going to suggest a reduction in electricity price, an increased energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, particularly in Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and carbon centres.
Within a few months, harmful effects will be noted.
You must meditate on the case of Denmark.
Europe's organic field campaign, of which 30 per cent of its electricity, is also one of the major carbon and gas users due to the intermittentness of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65 per cent and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the context of our energy policy, our neighbors are paying an electric bill of 40% higher than the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheaper electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would be a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition in principle to that type of energy, according to the investigations.
We remember that our country's energy policy has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Broadly oriented to export, it covers a range of specialized pymes in international markets that can create non-local jobs.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would support the sacrifice of most of those SMEs and the loss of 6,000 million euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to work for six hundred years when his manufacturer's drumming is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as well as no demonic source.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control both on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor design and some unforgivable human errors.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this incident, as did the two preceding.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it by all electrical actors who want to build a centre, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and the dividends dominate a very important debate on the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France 'the country of human rights'.
More recently, it is the administrative appeal of foreign students who have jumped to the titlers, with the Minister of the Interior (see Freedom newspaper of May 23rd), announcing in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or cameras".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is sufficient consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set out the direction by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone did so by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot be responsible for all the world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish sources.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which immigrants are treated.
In its programme François Hollande has limited the inclusion of banalities, indicating that the development of the code will allow for a solution to "the problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selectively profitable, but economically it is very face-to-face.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on migration (Excellent People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and damages employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular those with limited qualifications, with pressure to reduce their salaries.
But experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in low-employment sectors.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
In a way that a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, the complementarity between national and immigrant countries is causing the arrival of these latter to have a positive impact on national wages and employment.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows would result in a rise in actual wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, despite the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of US naturalized Nobel Prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1 per cent of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net (less cost) contribution of EUR 150,000 to public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which dissuasived immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, but it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to agree with this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century, the disasters of World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, the Huguenot, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonials in Greece.
Some may have thought that, in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One" that was about something to think about.
The universal suffrage, although it is a condition necessary for democracy, is not enough alone and can even become a "pressure instrument," as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Luke, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek reference had, in this regard, a dual revealing effect: it showed the need for a strong return from the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its incomprehensibility, of its incomprehensibility.
You need to think about this ambivalentity to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines ahead of the democratic battle have now been moved and that in many cases the Republican soldiers are no longer making progress in the right sense.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national references, organized according to needs and in an irregular manner.
A signature in white to the absolute European monarch or a high to the vacuum of the nationalist figurine: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to get hits of effect, but a common exercise of full, peaceful and continuous law, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that falls under the orders of the markets and the qualifying agencies, which is incapacitated and lacking solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty will recover the team of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce their debt, release from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is currently seeking a European economic governance.
Whatever it is.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new point of death.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more democratic Europe on the political agenda can it be achieved, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, we make Europeans.
Cards with no contact chips are generalised
The world hall of chip cards begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimal environment.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to the Eurosmart Office estimates.
The most powerful segment is the wireless technology, which allows you to subscribe to the common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which spends a lot of time on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining land in the field of unContacted payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75 000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards View without contact are being used.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard this year without contact.
In order to get the top run, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two major French institutions that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate, among their clients, bank cards available from the wireless system," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Tested Mobile Phone Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
Currently, there are few NFC-based devices (NFC) (Near Field Communication), which are essential for carrying out transactions.
"If you're rebuffing."
"But in order to experience a real increase next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 clients and collaborators with a fund that allows for the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Argel has already "certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that they are cooperating," he explained, without adding more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation of two French kidnappings in Niger last January would have reopened the passports.
Arrested at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the shocks of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
The owner of the terrorist
The study of calls carried out indicates several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, where Boko haram, and the other to a man who is likely to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been more and more evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of increasingly complex Kamikax or explosive devices and the same style as used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities are taking time to consider the group as a community of less-favoured liters of interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist diamond Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in essence, " western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emile in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is political and requires strict respect for Sharia, while its soldiers are engaged in the struggle against the imperial central government.
These latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram soldiers were particularly active and increased attacks on the commissions.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fevers.
The Christmas traditions require an attention that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the police-protected general headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebeb Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "sharing all information".
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are vying in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simple?
By listening to Republican candidates for presidential elections, voters could think so.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates were making more upbuilding statements and actions on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The lemmes, often unfounded, are extended to help Israel over China, Iran.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate on the road to the designation by the Grand Old Party, has threatened to lead the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America that is expected by the migration of entire segments of their sector to Asia.
As if that meant the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost blind to an attitude that "appalls" emotions.
He has requested a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stays stuck in the depths of the probes, remains unheard of.
To Reagan Style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions do not break its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he fanned.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil its obligations in relation to that partner.
Businesser Herman Cain, the second best-class candidate, shows shameless ignorance of such topics on his part.
Recently, I was hoping to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
The Governor, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that he is willing to deploy the U.S. Army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also preconceived by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current President's opponents replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a loved one and that he had to strike down the pillar in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their engineering dialogue with Iran, on the premature exit of Iraq's "boys" and their tergiversies in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks don't make them easy.
The people judge in a more positive way the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has failed to rely on military intervention that generates a hostage.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to resurrect its leadership, Obama makes the impression that it is more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been in service.
Gas must be provided to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
In symbol, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the wheel of the valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, every year it will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas in Western Europe through a first wave of 1.224 km from San Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 allowing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already mentioned the possibility of building a third tube by the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion at the time of this huge work presents a win area.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, North Stream will allow for gas supply directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In fact, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening its access to Western European markets.
At the end of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, in support of the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been aware, within just five years, of moving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the launch of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the Gazprom directives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-covered steel to protect it from the anchor of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them by caution," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to eliminate the protection measures for the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted in all its length: either by valves or by maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged in the waters of Sweden, but the project officials rejected it when they saw that the Swedish were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently at sea in front of its shores.
"In case of accident, we'll break the gas step in less than a minute," needs Jens Müller.
In the case of escape, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
However, constructionists consider it unlikely that a flight will be produced, as it has been foreseen that it will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot drawn by a ship carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device orbiting the inside of the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any type of repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it's 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces in order to carry out this project.
The lead company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participation.
She was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9 per cent).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewables, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for its total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and by 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of work should amount to EUR 7,400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes only the risk of spending.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on an arenas coast planted with pines.
One valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to arrive, before it is transferred to the German gases.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created about half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste of writing.
It's got an adventure air, hours of writing in the light of a veil.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangles, its goma, its pink white leaves, as ageed by time.
However, Moleskine's books with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes on the market, but different.
Maria Sebregondi, therefore the company's consultant, was responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technique, the soft skin (top wall), which refers to a barbed cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of Vanguardists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since then been responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And it worked.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far away, where only 3,000 books have been designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts business men as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitans, open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its beginnings, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its bookstores, from Fnac to small businesses in the city centre, and has learned to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the increase in e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the "Detour" exhibition where architects or artists expose their own paintings.
In August, he also launched a theater with Leopard tapes, due to the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: pockets, agendas, bibliographies, computer bases... The brand covers a wide range of support.
A success that leads to envy: in October 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, in the current Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled persons are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of disabled people begins today.
Despite a policy of resolution, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the entire population.
Disillusionment?
"No", says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress made 15 years ago is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, it's still too much to do."
It should be noted that disabled persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
It is common to have a more advanced age: 37% is over 50 years old (about 17% medium).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% have not completed the primary school and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, the long-term balance is very wide among them: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% of the average.
In other words, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the working world and that "consisting the cause of the problem", said Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality progresses but is too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Company Association for the City indicated that the respondents had "a level of knowledge about low disability", with "extensive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the objective of hire 6% of disabled workers, with the aim of being set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures of 2008, a ratio of 2.6 per cent is reached.
"We now reach around 3 per cent," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for returning contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "submitted to this import" as well as the amount disbursed has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated a great pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies that have between 20 and 49 employees have employees with disabilities in their model, compared with 82 per cent of the companies between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
At the point of confronting the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We're not going to be surprised to say there's been confusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting together, on the street of the audition of France City, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the move to redo its front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and for being a Belgian."
"I want to move forward," replied Lille's frontman.
As to the contrast between their presentations in your team and in your selection, "it's a set" has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all year old, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I've got to put myself in place."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brillar".
Don't forget about "place. "
She has been encouraging the Blues since she was seven years old, as well as during the 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will undoubtedly strengthen especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be faced," she recalls.
"We just got through a little bit ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made his part reference to "haughty."
"Orgulu" to argue "a gala party."
"Orgullo" also because of checking, as "neighbor", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a wonderful job," said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not participate in the next European competition, the technique would be pleased to be able to share a plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're humorous.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the game against France.
Portugal demonstrates great confidence
Portugal of Paulo Bento faces great optimism at the turn of Bosnia (22 p.m.), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the Ida party, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the election, which runs since September 2010, will be qualified for the 2012 Eurocopa.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to win.
In view of the game of ida (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but I couldn't mark the valuable goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it takes a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright stadium of the Light of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equal to enthusiasm, even if it is obvious that the party "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in Eurocopa 2012," however, relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The Spring Empathy in Bosnia forces Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosniaks may come to an impasse, although they also need to be marked.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it takes a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the start, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "do not allow them time to think".
A good idea, always, this time, be realistic.
