Thousands of minivans in the Central Park for bars
Thousands of people panicked because of the possible political nature of the snakes in the event of their flight to the Central Park to a police barracks.
Familiar personalities – the Democratic Party representing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's, Senator Jeffas Flake, Janet Jackson, and John Legendas – invited observers to join the country's austerity policy.
After we turned to the barrier on Saturday evening, the authorities quickly assured the observers that they were safe.
The first half of the program focused mainly on social justice.
About 60,000 observers gathered at the Grand Shrine, where they had to show Cardi B, The Weeknd, and other sights.
Some speakers asked the observers to speak to their representatives of the Congress and to express their opinion on the Senate's meetings this week on a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh.

Why do Hong Kong's domestic workers learn the funny moves?
There are about 300,000 foreigners working in Hong Kong.
They are required under the laws to live in the homes of employers.
These workers work six days a week, up to 18 hours a day for a small salary.
This is about Mehelanie, who is the only one who is assigned a holiday to community events that help to recover from the isolation work routine.
Spurgish seller Line Discover respect for Bedford seas

For more than 40 years, the woman who has been trading in the city centre will be honored – her private mer's reception.
Lina Ognissanti, selling ice cream and cheese on the "Dinky Donuts" in the Badford Midland Road street, together with the family were invited to buy paper or paper.
Almost 3,000 people have signed a petition online in order to receive or receive recognition.
Mr. Ognisanti said she was honored to receive such treatment.
According to Bedford's Mayor Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and his daughters were invited to his office to look at the city's royal and historical artifacts and explore the landscape.
"Lina Bedforfe is a special place and her kitchen is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I'm looking forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognisanti thanked his words to the people of Bedford who thought about it and said, "It is a great honor and a beautiful tribute."
The petitioner Sarkab Mahmoud said that he could not obtain both letters.
On hearing about the reception planned to be held by the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy about Lina because she has earned it because of her excellent character."
Street with Alsterio "Lambretta" Club
The Lambretta motorcycles were constant cultural assistants of the 7th century fashion.
A group of Italian motorists tried to protect the spirit of those times.
About 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered this week after the first Alsteria Lambretta club was set up.
One of the first members of the club, Chris Wilson in 1966, bought the first Lambretta for about £40.
“I was only a vehicle, but I knew I could use it.
That was such a sport.
I didn't get into fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old," he said.
"It was quite cheap and very reliable, you could buy it at an available price, and then you got to run something more than just move from point A to point B."
He took part in Lambretta's separate start on the Meno Island TT.
The first Alster "Lambretta" club was founded at the beginning of the 8th century and reformed 12 years ago.
“About 1971 motorists and other forms of transport were still less dominant, and in addition, the club was generally affected by accidents, so I thought, ‘All this is the end’,” said Chris.
"Then for some time there was renewed interest and, like, it grew more and more."
Philip Steele is a member of the Alsterio Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, the secretary responsible for the membership.
‘All reasons are different.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because almost everything started out.
Others are athletes enthusiasts or rockers – here you will find all people.
There are also those who are just interested in vintages.
Many engines are modified, so there are no two units.
It may not change the engine and take 35 or 40 miles per hour at a speed adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some very modified engines may be able to reach up to 100 miles per hour."
During the week, there were motions, and some engines had to be removed while driving.
And while North Ireland's weather is not always as pleasant as Lambretta's parents in Italy, it is now the sun for motorists driving around Ferman.
Ruth Davidson's request for a seat on "Brexito"
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow conservators for a period of time so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexito".
The head of the Scottish authorities claimed that within two years of the EU referendum, time was spent in the debate.
She expressed her opinion after the words of Boris Johnson on the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "unreasonably and completely absurd".
She said that it was time to support the Prime Minister's "Sunday Politics Scotland".
At a party conference held by the Torians, she said: “For the past two years, we have had time for debates.
The former Foreign Secretary was responsible for one of the best cabinets in the history of the country and during that period a large part of the current plan, which was already recognised last November.
Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the transaction and assist in the implementation of plans in the country.
I think the long period would be very useful."
Her comments followed the eight criticisms in Brexito's debate, which was not the first time expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that trust in Brexitu and that its cabinet plan can ensure smooth trade with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that, in other elections, he would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence from being held because in 2014, "the parties were promised that such an event would be the only one in their lifetime".
Asked about the possible repeat referendum on Brexito, she replied: “If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have not once said that it is impossible to repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and you are not satisfied with the results.
I would rather say that another referendum on Brexito could be drawn up because I had hoped for another outcome."
Several M8 reopened after the police incident
The M8 was reopened after a police incident in Glazgu.
According to the police, a few hours before 07.00, two steps were closed in 15 Townhead’s circle of concerns about the landscape.
The trip was not completed for three hours and was interrupted in a city where the Great Scottish Run was held.
A 20-year-old man was admitted to the Royal Hospital of Glazgo.
Christine'a Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual harassment suspected by Brittas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who had been in high school with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused of sexual harassment by a candidate to the Supreme Court of Canada when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Committee of Courts and explained that although he himself did not remember at home during the night during which the attack was likely to take place, he believed in Ford's statement.
Earlier, Keyser announced through his lawyer that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, when witnessing before the Courts Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, but did not remember his statement about Keyser that he believed in Ford's words.
On Friday, President Trumpas instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation every week when the Republican Senator Jeffas Flake and other dedicated senators asked for time for the investigation and for a week for the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer's committee saying he wanted to "how to contribute to an additional FTB study" on Kavanaugh.
“As my client has already explained, however, she does not know the judge of Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or composition in which he was with or without Dr. Ford,” says Keyser in his letter Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser "has not rejected Dr. Ford's statement and has already said press that he believes in Dr. Ford's testimony."
“But the simple and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot be approved because it does not remember the event”, continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was apparently behind the explosion, also claimed to contribute to the FTB investigation.
The innocent Chicago residents are talking about living with and receiving a corrupt police officer
The chief prosecutor of Ilinajas is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair police officer used innocent social housing and unjustly arrested many people.
To date, 42 justice has been unjustly executed.
If B. Wells's social housing project is currently in place, there is only a blank space left, and its inhabitants have lived for more than a decade on the horse without fear of using the corrupt Chicago police.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical prey of abuse of property, police reports and charges and charged him.
Willie's Martinas and Cleonas Gloris are two of the judges who have so far been convicted by the General Prosecutor General of the Kuko District of Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you would end up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and taking advantage of it," said Cleonas Glovis about Watts.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to run away from that region,
But I didn't have to go anywhere," said Willie Martin.
The judges of the Foxx ethics section will review further 30-40 cases related to Wattsu.
Ida B. Wells, the social worker Landonas Allens said that many people decided not to talk about Watts.
“Many people didn’t go,” he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident of Clarissos Baker, no one believed in the words of the residents about the official officer.
“He has his own money.
Who will believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepferis, who worked on a justice project at the University of Chicago, said that they were not really believed so far.
“They were all upset because these people didn’t seem to care about them, because they were black people living in a social building, so they were thought to be still guilty of something,” said Tepferis.
"Servant Watts was imprisoned for 22 months in 2013 for trying to arrest FTB informants.
Marteza Wise is also in prison thanks to Watto.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to get back to him," said Wisee.
"I've lost no need for four years."
72-year-old Fidelity trusts in the success of blocks, virtual reality and labour intelligence
The potential of Fidelity blocks was also noted by 2018 when all corporations started to talk about this technology.
Director-General Abby Johnson led investment into the cryptovulnery – the most risky and unstable asset class in recent years.
“ About two years ago, I and other older leaders were just having fun, especially in the Bitcoin market,” Johnson said.
We started talking and realized that we had to understand.
The courage led to the start of the "smooth" battle in the New Hampshire department when this price was about $180.
Last December, the price was almost $20,000, and Johnson said, "we're surprised that we started working on prices, although we never believed in it."
She didn't tell how many battoins or how much Fidelity worked.
Fidelity workers are clearly aware of these technologies.
There are now about 2,600 members of the Block Grid Club, called "Bitai and Blocks", organizing seminars and meetings with specialists.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to check out the remainder of the encryption funds using the Fidelity mobile program.
The 2015 opportunities to make a contribution in the battle.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible methods of use or at least briefly rejected them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And so far, Katie Chase, the top technology centre strategy for Fidelity and the leader of the Block Grid Incubator (FCAT) are looking for ways to use public and business blocks.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but it revealed that there was a great deal of interest in clients, partners and employees.
‘The whole thing is still very new.
If you are interested in the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find evidence of the concept," said Chase.
We have tried to adapt the blocks to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet such a step in order to solve these problems."
As far as it is concerned, the group devotes more attention to trying to understand the nature of those obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as art creations, value of ketones or use blocks grids in the supply chain.
"There's no one at the center of attention, but I think it's going to be a little bit of a bit of an interesting," said Chase.
Fidelity will be ready for it.
As an example, she pointed out Pebble, which was completely unsuccessful in trade standards, but finally bought Fidelity.
Their group has created a programme for the smart watch that was set up to be produced after three years of gathering millions through Kickstarter’s comprehensive financing project.
After showing Apple Watch and Fidelity on the market, it was ready.
It quickly adapted the Pebble programme for the new Apple product.
"We were not sure that the Pebble watch would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people were to try the imaginary clocks," she said.
"We learned and were ready when the imaginary newspapers were released into the mass market."
The island of Sulawesi was inhabited by landslides and tsunamis
On Friday, 29 September, the Indonesian island of Sulachi suffered a severe earthquake of 7.5 bacon, resulting in a tsunami and killing nearly 400 people.
There are many who have been injured, and it is believed that the number of dead is rising.
According to the representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, electricity and communications are not effective, so it is difficult to assess the damage to Palu in the city and in the fast-paced Dongal fisheries community.
California student marches with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of the KGTV, the Escondida Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had taken a bad-assisted decision to show racism in the event for senior classes.
"We will increase the acceptance of all kinds of diversity in our school," said Director Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate racism and segregation."
The report also indicates that the incident is investigated by Escondida secondary school, union officials and local police.
‘The school administrators have contacted corrupt school parents and lodgers and judicial penalties will be applied’ says the report.
On the basis of a report by the police, students from the school in San Diego, north of the main classes, wore pickles with drawings from which a racist inscription was produced and were photographed.
The school usually approves of earlier records, but the photographed official pictures of some students choose their own words.
The Union report states that such conduct is "inconsistent with the culture, values or history of Escondida secondary school".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"Escondida's secondary school and its family values and a culture based on unity throughout the community."
The former teacher Cade's Pannells said to the KGTV channel that the social media saw a disturbing picture.
"That hurt me personally," he said.
“They may have felt funny, but it isn’t.
Only indiscriminately can laugh at such things."
Heart surgery awaiting Shaquille's O'Neal son Shareefas lost the 1st UCLA season
Shareef's son of Shaquille O'Neal, a member of the Corps Museum, will have to spend the first UCLA season on heart failure.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Nealai will perform heart surgery to remove the disorder that UCLA doctors have observed during normal treatment.
"Thank God, UCLA doctors have noticed the problem before," O'Nealas told TMZ.
"As soon as rehabilitation is done, I will visit and be a normal student.
I'll be back soon."
O'Nealas signed an official search protocol in August, promising to play in the UCLA team, which has already attracted at least one voice name and is one of the best team of the country's leading team from 2018 to 2019.
"Shareef has greatly improved in secondary school," said Mr. Steve Alford last month to reporters.
“He is a goldsmith, has skills, is athletic and will be a wonderful new member of the team.
We enjoy the composition of this year's team and Shareef will add it to it.
He has a good foundation and can improve both sides."
According to the 247Sports data, 18-year-old O'Nealas is a 4-star candidate, 8-place in 2018 in new ratings as a hard country player and 41-place as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Nealas helped the middle school to achieve a record score – 25:9.
Sarah's eldest son, Palin, is charged with violence against his father
28-year-old Track Palina was arrested for three crimes, including murder.
The next day he was taken for the first time by family violence.
According to court records, the incident took place in Palin's homes in Vasilo, Alaska, where Track Palinas violated his father, Todd, who was convicted of fraud.
28 years after the six-day incident, three offences, including incineration, were committed.
The Court’s documents indicate that the dispute began when a man called to take the shipment, but his father did not agree to grant it.
As explained in the Court's statement, Trackus Palina was arrested for his first grade arrest and for his fourth grade arrest and for his fourth grade criminal offence, and his father was injured in face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palina's police officers who were talking to him decided to stop using weapons.
The Court’s statement also indicates that the man is lying on the garage floor before he is caught.
Sarah Palin, quoted in the documents of the court, said that her son was "insensitive" and "used certain medicines".
It was also confirmed that the Tracks Palinas told the police a couple of bottles of beer before.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and charged with family violence against women, preventing family violence and armed violence from being reported in light of the facts.
"Seeing how my son feels about his return, the other family who survived the trauma of postural stress, and I know what the wounded soldiers are doing," said a former Republican candidate to the Vice-Presidents and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I'm better than ever to realize that America's best needs a leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren claims that the candidate to the presidents after the mid-term election
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct the confused government that has to lead women," said the democracies senator, speaking to minors gathered at Holjoko Square in the city of Massachusetts.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, it is not appropriate to consider whether it is appropriate to apply to the President."
Warren, trying to cover his post with the Republican representative in Geoffu Diehlu state, earlier said that the president would not apply for the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and follow-up to this, the only important thing for 2020," she said to the reporters in August, speaking at the National Press Club.
"The most important battle is the midterm elections, and they will be important not only in Massachusetts but throughout the country."
Warren is already considered to be a potential candidate for the 2020 democratic candidate to compete with President Donald Trumpu.
However, it would expect a difficult first-time election, which may involve other well-known Democrats – former Vice-President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
The mental health clinic is associated with the third fatal death in less than one year
According to The Mail, three people have been killed for years in a terminal psychiatric clinic.
The television comedy girl Shaquelle Vidal died on April 7, almost a month later in West London, Marylebone, in the nightingale hospital.
Her son James Lyle (57 years) was the manager of the Risk Insurance Fund, the millionaires and former supporters of the Conservative Party.
The future chief man died almost six months ago from the day he graduated from high school in Daisy Boyd (28th) – one of the "River Caffe" creators named Rose Gray.
After his release from the license company, Dr. Boyd died on 5 October from cocaine unlawfully introduced by the clinical visitor.
Two months before his release from the hospital, the film director Alan MacDonald (61) stopped filming sites four days after his release.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because this was not enough to prevent imports of illicit substances.
The BBC release "Mock The Week" came from Avos Midal daughter Shaquelle in the clinic on March 11th.
Last week, at a previous meeting of the Westminster Crown Court, royal lawyer Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquelle died from AWOL and after a week's psychological recovery.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avas Vidal, said: "My client wants to know what happened to Shaquelle, what she was dealing with and what she did."
Ms. Lyle was called Shaquelle's daughter.
"I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time."
At the hearing, Mr. Gordillo revealed that Shaquelle invited him on 4 April and told him to buy and use cyanide and he was 20 minutes from this call to the clinic “more than a dozen times” but no one answered.
“I’m showing that further events could have been avoided if someone had disappeared,” he added.
On 5 April, the clinical doctor found that Shaquelle's mental condition was very poor."
At least 48 hours later, she was hit by a flight computer.
The nightingale representative said to his family and friends and said: "Our clinical objective is to provide high quality care in a safe and well-being environment."

Led Zeppelin was brought back to court because of the alleged theft of Starway To Heaven
Led Zeppelin was brought back to court on the guitar rifo used by the group in 1971 by Stairway To Heaven.
It is claimed that part of the 1971 British group has been published.
The Court of Appeal rejected the decision in 2016 that the group did not copy the name of another group ‘Spirit’.
The search was submitted in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, a reliable guitarist.
It seems that the case for the "Led Zeppelin" song "Stairway To Heaven" will last a long time – as it does.
The group will again stand before the court on charges of fraud in 1971.
The US Appeals Court rejected in 2016 the decision that the group did not copy from the beginning of the Spirit Music Group.
It is claimed that the court has made mistakes, for example, misinformation about copyright laws.
She was returned to the court.
Michael Skidmore's first search was submitted by the guitarist Randy Wolfe in 2015.
Police officers ended up in Michigan when the police transferred to their alleged murder
The suspect of his daughter's murder was captured by the inhabitants of Michigan after the police raids that ended him when he was transferred to the police car.
It is estimated that Adam Nolinas killed his daughter on the fourth day of 33 C.E., in the city of Vajominge.
He was brought to court on Friday at a hospital where he was found by the officer when he was transferred by the police car to the SUV, as Nolina called the police to try to escape at the speed at which an intensive departure took place.
He was convicted of five serious crimes, including murder to kill and escape from the police.
"The appeal to the court in the hospital is not normal, but this is not the first case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Oyoming Police.
‘It is subject to treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
Judges often agree that it can be implemented."
Nolin's girl body will be found on Thursday in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot in one cell and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and gave a short description of the man and his "Dodge" pickup in June 1996.
The man noticed his wallet and drove out to a fast US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolina and her cappillary got into the concrete wall, then she got out of the car and started running fast.
As he ran away, he shot at the restless police officers.
One policeman sat in the police car in the SUV and moved Nolin from the back.
The monitor filmed the event.
Noline has been taken to a hospital with severe but stable conditions and remains there until she is released and transferred to the county of Kent.
"This incident has shown that Western Michigan police are risking their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffee.
"They have taken a man very quickly and with the appropriate measures and we will greatly increase them."
Nolin was charged with two charges of attempted murder and was also accused of running away from the police, carrying a hidden weapon and committing a serious crime by using a deadly weapon.
He has not yet been involved in his daughter's murder because the investigation is ongoing.
"Of course, we continue our investigation of human murder, which we will soon be able to submit to the county prosecutor of Kent for a while," said Maguffee.
The judge beat the man with his fists when he went into his house for a long time
The judge was not able to bring a maximum penalty for a man who stood before two criminals who tried to enter his house.
Although one prisoner tried to carry a wooden spear, 63 - year - old David did not give it up.
A man who worked as a security guard at the university was beaten by two criminals and shot at one of their teeth.
Inflammably escaped, but after the massacre on Mr. Oldham's blood was left, according to which Craig Fordas was found and taken four months later.
In a statement to Fordu, who did not have teeth trying to get into an individual's house of Ormskerke, Lancashire, King Justice Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t believe Mr. Oldham’s reactions – when you were surprised to see only your eyes and your nose, you met him at home, he ran away with you.
He also beat your fellow man, who tried to get into the second height and broke off the roof.
On Friday, after Ford had been sentenced to three years and four months, the judge said: “I believe you have received two lessons.
First, there is no need for David Oldham, and second, it is better not to argue with the police.
Because of your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you're caught in a dog.
It's still a small punishment."
He added: "I want to thank Mr. Oldham for how he responded to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that the crime committed by Fordas in 2016 had already been sentenced to another arrest and had to be spent three years, but had been released equally.
Mr. Olddams Liverpool appealed to the Royal Court of Justice when he heard a disturbance at home on 5 April.
“ Mr. Olddams, who has a man, suddenly left his house and rebelled against his current defendant, ” said John.
Fearing for his safety, he fell to his face and broke his teeth.
Then another intruder broke out of front of Mr. Oldhama, who was instinctively pulling him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the coroner took a wooden board and tried to drive Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Get him out of my face."
The Comrade said to Mr Oldham: "If we leave, we'll leave" and together with Fordu fled from the crime scene.
On August 2nd, the police passed Ford on the way to the Wavertree area.
Forda pushed the police to the dog, and then he pulled him into the fifth.
It is believed that the second arrest is still free.
In 25 years of absence of permanent residence, Ford acknowledged the charge of intrusion, confusion and dangerous driving, although it is prohibited and does not have a driver's certificate.
Torios activist Johnson was critical of the apologetics
Torios activists today landed Boris Johnson when he was removed as a "murder and aggressive man".
P Johnson, trying to convince ordinary people with his uncompromising speech about Brexit, received an ex-Minister of Commerce Digby Jones's serious assessment, which was also endorsed by the participants at the Birmingham conference.
David also betrayed Mr. Johnson, for he was concerned about the title of the magazines rather than the policy.
In his speech with MailOnline, Mr May added that he was simply “insolent” because he could not be a universal leader.
The response was expected when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs re-examined the Prime Minister's Chequers plan and concluded it "inconsistency" and "completely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and that he did not agree with the departure in the referendum two years ago.
It also called on the Government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May pointed out that they are critically playing political games and claimed that they are not bled up and are ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC on the occasion of the Tower Conference, Mr May said: "I believe in "Brexitu".
Former minister of trade in liberarians, Lord Jones, who is now acting independently, has gained minority support by hearing the "Brexito" perspective.
It was people's work when he made an opinion on Mr Johnson, who apparently answered the concerns of businessmen.
Without particular mention of Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones allowed him to understand that he is “a quiet and aggressive man”.
"The business is very important, so by saying "the velniop business", the former Foreign Secretary has shown that there is really a soft and aggressive person," he said.
"I'm not going anywhere with him."
Lord Jones has also improved his speech in the hall following Mr May's response to the meeting of the leaders of Zalcburg, hearing the EU leaders' "presiding" on its cabinet plan.
In the course of the negotiations on "Brexito" he was also critical of Mr. Johnson's former leader, Ruth Davidson.
Mr May's Union of Ministers said to the MailOnline newspaper that the intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough supporters between the House to be able to avoid the Prime Minister.
They said: “This news is no longer so dangerous.
He is disappointed, but he does not have enough supporters in Parliament's party, and he himself knows that.
We see the contrast between David, who expressed his opinion with Boris, who satisfied his personal ambition."
Business Secretary Greg Clarkas criticized Mr. Johnson, who was sceptically involved with "Brexit" businessmen.
In his speech at the Tower Conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clarkas said that Mr. Johnson was "not quite right".
He said: “I am amazed that someone can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world, which would not have been successful for the mining companies."
In an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, David acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to give a lot of relief.
However, he believes that the government must remain silent and reach a similar agreement in Canada rather than what the Cabinet of Ministers proposes.
When asked how Mr. Johnson managed to lead the courts, he did not allow the case to be handed over to the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
Quoting Mr. Johnson's proposal to establish a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings in British policy is the idea of a fantastic policy."
He added: "Our association is catholic and many of its ideas are worthy of titles, but not rigid policies."
Bulgaria spent 80 million euros on European taxpayers' money in empty restaurants
Bulgaria has spent 80 million euros on European taxpayers' money on the empty old-school restaurant, which now appears to be the same as the "Surice and Corton".
The Balkan country has issued £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
After returning to the former size, the restaurant was set up on its own.
The local government of the territory of the Kraków has promised to transfer the illegal work.
The Bulgarian Government has spent ten million EU non-taxable medium-sized cities in the restaurant.
The Balkan country has released $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore old-fashioned pillars and buildings, but instead of returning their former size, it has received proposals for construction work.
The remains of the well - to - do reconstruction seem to be the same as the construction of “surprises and reconnaissances” and therefore are not attractive to tourists.
For example, thinkers found that the fortress of the Middle Ages of the western Bulgarian city of Pernik Krakre and the Roman fortress Trayanov Vrata near Ihtimano was rebuilt using a polymer concrete, most commonly used for basic justice.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Government of Bulgaria have privately agreed that this failure requires learning.
"The fortress is in a condition of confusion," said architect and founder Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
She's retired for 16 centuries, and now she's cursed."
Such reactions were expected after the Krakre Fort restaurant in Pernik, so the local government promised the removal of the item in 2019.
The Pernik's claim for non-conformity changes has been concluded as a ‘drink from the retina’.
Bisantia Yailata is a strong source of "syrian strength" because it has been recovered from the blockades of smooth white which are not affected by air conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts are in line with new doubts about how the European Union uses development funds.
Stilling Abbeys have a role in this year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event
Hundreds of fashionable motorists from all over the United Kingdom are on the streets of windmills to collect money for the Movember fund.
The event is called "Kilnaus gentleman's journey" and is organised annually to collect money and increase public awareness of prostate cancer.
This year the abies are marketed in London and other United Kingdom places, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year’s “Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride” events take place in the United Kingdom and in 650 other cities around the world and have been able to collect more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
The official event website says that in this year’s event of 120 000 people “contained their classics, their appearances, their tweeting costumes, their classic and vintage-style motorcycles, and allowed them to collect funds and raise awareness about male health, specifically about prostate cancer and men’s mental health”.
The "Ditinguished Gentleman's Ride" event was held in Sydney, Australia, for the first time by Mark Hawkas.
The idea was inspired by Don Draper's picture of the Mad Men series, where he sat on his classic motorcycle on his best bike.
In London this year, hundreds of sharks, including a white taxi breed dog – Sergeant Piper, were transported to the Tuerie Valley.
Tennis ass Boris Beckeris has been exposed to skin cancer
Boris Beckeris thanked the doctors who successfully removed the skin cancer.
In Becker's photos only see a small patch to the eyes from the sun.
"It was a simple check and seemed more simple than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
After revealing that he had been treated with skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On the third day, he published a German-speaking Twitter news about his health: "I want to thank Martina Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich for his cure."
In 50-year-old photographs made on Sunday, only a small poster is seen at the eyes of the sun.
"The next day I visited a dermatologist who removed my basic cell carcinoma," Beckeris told the German newspaper "Image".
"It was a simple check and seemed more simple than it really is."
The primary cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, for use in 75% of cases.
In time, there is a high likelihood of recovery.
Becker is currently different from Lilly Becker (42) and they reported the chapter in May.
The Tennis star has highlighted six important prizes in the drawings of units, 13 Masters Series titles and Olympic gold medals in two rounds.
He has recently been observed working with friends at the 185th "Octoberfest" Munich.
A 24-year-old female who was beaten for body sizes in an unknown training platform
At the pressure platform due to body size, an unknown amputated British athlete decided not to go further.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal at the British athletic championship this year, said he was shot on Friday at Lidso.
At 24 years of age and five, Mayho, 11 years old, said that while waiting for her training, he was surprised by her words.
At approximately 17 p.m., a full-fledged match came out of the "stairs".
However, when a sports star arrives, which seeks a place in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, the Great Britain team, is dedicated to a man.
From western York City to Kitty City, Mr. Mayho said: “The most important thing is that the other people in the full platform have lost their eyes.
Such people may be frightened and forced not to trust themselves, but it is the MANO body, MANO's "mechanism".
On the news of his event on Twitter, a young athlete was caught up in the social media.
Andy Lewis of the MBE order wrote: “Stora!!!
Is he deaf or blind?
It's bullshit – Jesse, with you, it's all right.
I won't let the asshole hit your ass."
He added: "I'm a joke.
Not only because of him but also because of the environment that ignored him.
I'm glad you're all right.
You're an example for young people.
Show that you need to be proud of yourself, and not satisfied can be rejected!"
At the University of Lidso, Mr. Mayho was interested in his teenage years, encouraged by one of her older sisters' coaches.
Since then, she has been able to take her second place at the British Senior Championship in Muller, which took place in Birmingham in July of this year.
It won the medal of the British championship only a month after the victory in the games of North England.
Athletics refused to comment more on the event.
If no less than 50 million users are assigned, Facebook will pay $1.25 billion
Using security shield, criminals were able to reach at least 50 million Facebook targets.
However, a large number of arrests were reported only after three days, Friday.
Now Facebook under the new European Data Laws, there is a massive fine
If no less than 50 million items are broken down, Facebook may have to pay $1.25 billion.
The criminals were able to reach orders for security protection and could therefore reveal much of the confidential personal information.
However, Facebook reported only on Friday, three days later, and until evening he was unable to tell how much British assignment was damaged.
As long as the search for programmes continues, the Irish Data Protection Commission, which checks how the media giant complies with European data compliance requirements, has criticised the company by saying: "Reporting is inexhaustible."
Facebook, under the new European Union data laws, is highly penalised because companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of global turnover.
Last year's Facebook earned 31.2 billion euros of revenue.
Criminals have reached an assignment using the "Facebook" function "See How" to allow users to see how their profiles appear to others.

At the end of World War II, 1944, he left the Soviets from Kauna, where he had learned and lived, moved to the West from 1947 to England.
In 1992, he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
1952-1957. V. Dargis was leading "Nida Press" in London.
In 1954 he established a Nidos book club and led it up to 1957 and 1983-1991.
The newspaper "British Lithuanian" (later "European Lithuanian") was printed in the press of the "Nida" Club, and other newspapers of the Great Britain Lithuanians.
The "Nida Book Club" allowed the latest Lithuanian writers living in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Germany.
From 1959 to 1961 V. Dargis' work U.S. radio "American vote" (Miunchene) dictator, director, journalist.

The following records were heard in the "MG Baltic" case: accused interviewed Gabriel Landsberg
The meeting of the Court opened a speech (in November 2015) between former MG Baltic Vice-President Raimondo Kurlianski and former "worker" Vytautata Gappši.
When you hear the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what the accused are talking about right now.
True, the instrument is heard that R. Kurlianski and V. Gapšys are talking about a Christmas celebration, sometimes called the name of the current conservative leader Gabriel Landsberg, but what is exactly understood is difficult to understand.
Liabilities for both physical and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons are charged with: Labour and Liberal Union parties, MG Baltic, former liberal and "working" leaders E. Masouli, Vitatu Gappši, former parliamentary liberal S. Gustavi, Seima member G. Steponavic and former Vice President R. Kurlianski.
Labour parties are accused of having an impact on mining and trade, the Liberal Union is accused of fraud, trade and exploitation, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling these parties.
Officials suspect that the policy has taken or has been discussed with MG Baltic vice-president R. Kurlianski on the subject, and then proposed or endorsed a positive initiative in the Seime and other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Union, E. Masoulis, is accused of the impact of trade, the incineration and illegal exploitation of the former Vice-President of this party, Mr Steponavic, of the abuse of the former member of the City Council of Vilnius - the incineration.
V. Gapšys is accused of the effects of freezing and trafficking, R. Kurlianskis - on the effects of buying and selling.
Question: What is the greatest opportunity to win the President's second election?
The second election tour was attended by four candidates from the top rankings – economist Gitas Nausėda, the unpublished Prime Minister Saulus Skvernelis and two Fathers Union – candidates from the first elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats Party (TS-LKD) – member of the Seima Member Ingrida Shimonytė and diplomat Vygauta Uschackas.
In fact, on Sunday it became clear that the TS-LKD had received support in the markets by I. Shimonytė and V. Uschackas withdrew from the parliamentary struggle.
As data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, Mr. Nausėda's second president's right to win, but the head of Vilmorus, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says it is too early to make conclusions.
"Avoid (from others – DELFI) It's very important to look at whether the parties are talking about or about people who are dynamic.
These are the doubles of the Shimonyth was from one study to another, and Nausédas had stopped growth, even the decrease in Ushacko.
This growth is very important to you," said the sociologist.
In addition, with regard to the results of the survey, it is clear that at least a percentage of people have not yet decided on why they vote or think they are not at the elections at all.
If the second presidential elections were to be held by I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernel, the war would be interrupted - 32.7 per cent for I. Šimonyt, 30.9 per cent for S. S. Skvernel.
The truth is, even 36.4 per cent of people replied that they did not vote for either one of these candidates or did not know what to vote for or at the elections.
Sociologist V. Goodys once again stressed that we have not seen a complete picture since all candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been published.
"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is a social Democrat candidate? He's been a candidate for 30 years, isn't he going to?
When he gets up, you'll see how he's dealing with other candidates.
So this side of Lithuania, which is less successful than anyone who is less reflected," said V.
In his statement to the International Institute of Relations and Political Sciences at Vilnius University (WU TSPMI), Politologist Majvydas Jasramskis says that there are circumstances that are still too early to make conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected the withdrawal of V. Ushakk since the March.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference between 5 percentage points does not really show any advantage of one candidate.
The only thing I could see was that Nauséda would look good before Uschack... later, bearing in mind that if those people really came to vote.
It looks good before Skuvernel, too, but we are now comparing apples and flowers, because, for example, Nausėda has already announced that he will be a participant, Skuvernel has not been published.
In addition, the interview was conducted before the first conservatory elections as it appeared after them," says the politician.
According to him, Mr. Nausėda has a small amount of money, but when all candidates are already published, he can cancel it.
"The situation is quite the same.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - results in terms of conditions.
I would like to remind you that within half a year before the presidential elections in 2003, Roland Paks had 5 per cent support to vote for him and then won the elections.
This cannot be done in any way," said Mr. Jastramskis.
DELFI recalls that in the presidential elections the candidates have already been published by economist G. Nausėda, Seima Member I. Shimonytė, philosopher Arvyda Jozaitis, economist, Seima member Ausra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Union Petras Austrevičius, Member Naglis Puteikis and Member of the European Parliament, Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accused Israel of attempting a cyberattack
"The regime in which cyber weapons are used is clear from cases such as "Stuxnet" (computer virus) and this time tried to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," writes Information Minister Mohammed Javadas Azari Jahromi via Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by Stuxnet in 2010 on the virus caused by damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that this harmful program was created by Israel and the United States.
"Because of our technical team's blindness, they are left with empty hands.
We will continue to address this opposition in international forums," Mr. J. A. Jahromi stressed.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fatthai said that on the first day of the technical team's election, many attempts were made to break into their systems, but the suspects had been "given a firm opening".
The Imuls man in the health club was badly injured, his recovery failed.
The accident occurred about 10.40 a.m.
The man with basine had been badly injured by the floods in 1945, and he had been drowned by the water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
He was tried to get it.
Soon after receiving urgent medical assistance, he was still trying to get it back, but he was unable to survive.
On his way to the hospital, he died in a car accident.
This tragedy was highlighted by the head of the Imuls network of Health Clubs, Antana Sakalauskas.
"In our data, 73-year-old man visited our health club on Monday morning with his wife, Fabianian g.
The basein client ran for about 30 minutes, then walked down to the basin street to relax and suddenly collapsed after a few minutes.
The country was a human being - a client who was swimming in the same way and a basic supervisor - immediately responded, pulled it out of the water and began to get it.
The man was always waiting until the men arrived.
The club’s staff immediately withdrew from emergency medical assistance, which came within 5 minutes.
When the doctor arrived, he restored the man’s pulse and breathing and transferred him to a medical car.
When we went to the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the man’s health, and unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man was not alive.
We mean the family of the deceased man who suffered the loss of his family.
Firstly, the incident could have caused a client's health problem.
According to the information provided to family physicians, he is suffering from diabetes.
It is always important to assess your options and to consult doctors and health club specialists in the context of serious health problems.
There is an up-to-date supervisor with the main task of monitoring the pool, access to it and ensuring customer security from other workers.
Such baseline monitors have radio stations that can immediately contact administration and registration, respond to their requests or withdraw assistance.
Four times a year staff training is carried out in connection with the security programme - much more often than required by law.
At the same time, workers are given theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to deal with accidents, monitor or observe procedures and rules of procedure properly.
How Portugal radically solved the heroin problem
In the 10th century, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Every Portuguese horse knew something that would have happened since this dead drug.
Now, just over a few decades ago, the country has grown to one of the lowest drug - related deaths in the world.
Not a son in Norway: He has changed four families and does not speak Lithuanian
According to the press report of the LNK, Lithuania did not have the right to bury children four years ago and to see them through the Barnevernet and the Court of Justice of the Norwegian Child Rights Service.
The woman’s story led to an international scandal followed by all the media.
People's tickets for the return of a boy to Lithuania were also made in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the public did not help Gražina and her family to restore the children of Lithuania’s citizenship.
Today, a woman says how she has been separated from her son for the past few years and how she and her child are attending meetings after two years.
At the time Gražina did not have the right to bury children, the boy was 8 years old, and today he is 12 years old.
In the first two years of her life, Gražina never saw her son again, it was banned.
Later Grazina was granted the right to meet her son twice a year, only one hour.
During the last few months of the hearing, the number of hearings for Lithuania increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
The meetings with the sons always remind us of encounters in the severe beating prison - watching the officers, and taking them into custody - a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and doesn't speak Lithuanian," - heart open this Tuesday evening, Gražina, her saying - in LNK
The election will not be returned to Massew once and for all
On Tuesday, the Appeals Court announced that the defendant's complaint was rejected.
The conclusion is final and irrevocable.
In the case of political corruption, former head of the Liberian Court of Justice, E. Massius appealed to the Appeals Court, asking him to return any personal money - once taken from him and from his family money.
More than EUR 242 000 has been taken from E. Massius.
This money is subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and is constantly extended.
For the last time, the Vilnius District Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Massius of the Appeals Court did not ask for all money back - he seeks to recover from the married money of 800 euros and his money - 690 euros, 130 United Kingdom weight sterlings, $1600.
The former policy says that the last money has been allocated to the US planned journey.
At the hearing of the Court of Appeal, E. Masuulio lawyer Mindaugas Blouvas requested that these money be returned on the first day of the hearing, because the spouses had the opportunity to have such amounts.
The prosecutor, Justas Laucius, asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Court of First Instance is lawful and justified, no more property is limited, as stated in the claims.
The Court rightly found that it provides the basis for the confiscation of property as well as for the confiscation of extended property," said J. Laucius at the Court's meeting.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to repay more than EUR 242 000 in the case of political corruption.
These money will be found through multiple accusations of corruption in the home and in the car of the former policy.
The College of three Judges found that from the material of the case, property rights were limited to funds consisting of the crime committed by E. Massiusul.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the debtor is not limited disproportionately or too long to be restricted," says the Court of Justice Nijol Šikkienės, the Court of Justice and the Court of Justice.
The judges pointed out that in the case of E. Massius, due to serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex, so it is necessary to extend the time limit for the temporary limitation of property in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and the expansion of property.
The prosecutors claim that former vice-president Raimondas Kurlianskis gave 106 thousand euros to E. Massoulu for the successful decision-making of the Seime Group.
Both of the accused believe that according to E. Massioul's find money - 90,000 euros - was R. Kurlianski's loan.
The case data show that E. Massius is worth EUR 242.4 thousand, U.S. weight steroids 130 million and US$ 1.6 billion.
E. Massius and his lawyer did not try to recover money once, but the courts rejected their requests.
The former policy has been said that the share of these funds belongs to other people and has been intended to invest in real estate or to be part of his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that the funds would be obtained in a criminal manner.
The Court of Appeal has previously been published to see from E. Massouli’s claims that these funds could have been received by adopting more than EUR 100 000.
The lawyer claims that the balance of net money taken over over time could be obtained from undeclared sources of income, non-declaration, non-confirmation of documents and perhaps no legal income.
In the case of political corruption, charges are made against three legal persons - the Labour Party, the Liberal Union, the MG Baltic Group.
In addition to E. Masiulio, the charges were filed against the former "worker" Mr. Gytatu Gappschi, former Liberal MP Charun Gustani, Seima member Gintar Steponavic and former "MG Baltic" vice-president R. Kurlianski.
R. Curlianski is accused of giving softs to former parliamentarians E. Masouli, St. Gustavi and V. Gappschi.
The Americans had a dangerous manoeuvre of the Russians
During a 25-minute transition, according to the U.S. military forces, the Russian SU-27 flew straight ahead.
The Russian plane crashed over him the second time, using the train’s speed, and carried out a flight with a turnaround.
Travelers reported a feeling of turbulence during the first accession and a stir through the second accession.
The Russian military has the right to practice in international air space, but this interaction has not been justified.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents, including the 1972 Convention on Marine Accidents and Overseas Prevention (INCSEA), - said in its report the U.S. military forces.
"Unsafe actions increase the risk of inadequate calculation and possible encounters," notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized the incident but believed that the Russian SU-27 had been considered "safe distance" from the US.
The costs of parents are not reduced further: only EUR 50 per month shall be allocated to the obligor
According to a survey conducted by the company "Baltic Surveys" at the end of August, a survey showed that a third (32%) of their single-year-old school-age child's "appropriate" was allocated to school this year less than 100 euros, a fifth (21%) was spent from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and at least one fifth (18%) of their child's school was spent more than 200 euros at the end of summer.
Parents whose children started going to the first grade in this academic year spent an average of 220 euros on their child’s school crèche, while other parents whose children had already completed the first grade gave their child a lower amount - about 160 euros on average.
The cost is not always decreasing, and for years science has been running away, as parents often have to pay money for their children’s bets and corpetators.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one beer may vary from EUR 20 to EUR 100 in the country.
Parents of school - age children were asked to tell them what average amount they are planning to devote to their single child’s demanding employment within a month.
The fourth (23 per cent) of the children interviewed planned for post-training activities up to 20 euros per month, and the fourth (26 per cent) claimed that they had paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31 per cent) for the child’s job, from 50 to 100 euros per month, and six (17 per cent) indicated that they planned to allocate 100 euros or more.
In fact, in Lithuania, children under school age receive an informal education scholarship of EUR 15 per month.
All these money can be used only for one beer, and if the employment price is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
In the case of a child who has several births or a number of school - age children in the family, the cost of supplementary education may rise double.
According to Justin Ambrasienė, a leading marketing manager of Vivius.lt consumer loans, small or medium-income families can become a real challenge, especially when several children grow up in the family.
In the course of the years of science, parents have become heads of money, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without wasting their money.
We note that the costs of parents are particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to be properly prepared for new years of education, but they are still higher than during summer, as parents are willing to invest in their own pensions.
Often, when there is a lack of funds and a responsible assessment of their possibilities, they are tired and loan," says J.Ambrasianj.
The law enforcement officers helped to keep the driver of the accident
Last week, from 29 October to 4 November, Kauna police officers checked the speed of drivers.

The law enforcement officers were kept in custody of 2 persons trying to remove from the scene.
After the person has been transferred to police officers, the average speed of 2,03 per cent for the 34-year-old alcoholic strength of the driver.
On 3 November, at 16.50 p.m. Kaunas-Mariyampolé-Suvalki, officials, having seen a suspect man on the road, stopped him from checking.
For the 48-year-old driver, the average rate of entry is 2.14 per cent.
The man said to the officials that he had pulled out two bottles of oil and went on a bicycle.
It's going to pay up to 220 euros.

Cottons are already in the fourth set of trolleybuses
Today, four of the mobile street exhibitions "Atia Old, Good News" have been presented to Kaunas Streets - an old trolebus with a smile and a description of "Sienograf's inscriptions" marked by an old trolebus.
The city of Kauna told of a new relief trolley.
"This old "Sorry" has also changed its very yellow color to a much more colourful and tighter care.
It will also show "Atia's old, the good news!" - the representatives of the municipality of the city of Atia posted in a photo.
The mobile street art shows "Atia's old, good news" for interacting with old trolleys that will be replaced by new ones next year.
Over the next year, old "Schoda" trolleys will be replaced by 85 new ones and modern "Solaris" trolleys.
The portal recalls that the first road on the side of the road was flooded by trolebuses into the Kauna Streets a month ago.
On the trolebus picture are some well-known accents of Kauna street art – old-fashioned puppies and drums.
Less than a week after the first visit to Kaunas, the artist Timothy Norvilos - Morfia was released.
On a troleobus-like lens, a yellow car, which is often referred to as "fail".
"You wanted to install the trolley.
This line looks very smooth, especially because it matches the trolebus wheels.
When the wheels are stuck on the wheel, it seems that this is part of the car.
When we pushed the wheels white, we made them cross retrostyles, which was very confusing.
Until the trolebub was buried, it was really not so wonderful," - as before the port of Kauna.diea.lt spoke to a street artist.
And on 27 October, there was a sudden fall on the third trolebus.
It's wrapped in white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolebus roof, one of K.Donelaichi's houses, on the right - central post.
"The devil" has always been my favorite," Morfai started a third troleoby by dating the artist Morfai.
New market
"Kauna Day" recalls that last week Kauna's public transport company "Kauna buses" with the Polish company "Sularis Bus & Coach S.A" has signed a 29.4 million contract, which indicates that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolebuses.
"The Kaunas invests in the largest amount for the renewal of public transport throughout their history.
This agreement allows all of us to replace the old "Schoda" stamp trolebuses for many years and offer the most comfortable services for passengers.
The new low-tech trolleys will have more seats, efficient salon conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
The new technical and equivalent work of the contact network and road repair allows trolleys to drive more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolleys will be very close to the city," said Mindaugas Grigels, director general of Kauna Buses.
The first new trolleys will reach Kauna in August next year, and all old trolleys will be replaced by December.
Cavalry sensation: Queen Elžbieta II invited M. Markle's mother to celebrate together
Hercogie Meghan supported British royal rooms.
This is evidenced by the special Queen of Elžbietas II gesture: the British monarchy invited her to her Sandandam rooms, the mother of Sassex Hercogiene, Doria Ragland, to publish the British press.
This kind of honor is not expected even by the parents of heredity Kate.
Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have so far been invited to a traditional Christmas prayer with a royal family.
An unnamed source of Sunday Express revealed that the invitation of Doria Raglabd is "the royal title of Meghan".
Through the royal vesture of Doria in May, she supported the queen "with her own arm."
At the same time, the invitation to celebrate Caláda was repeated in language that Dr. Ragland is planning a longer public service in Great Britain.
It's amazing that she wants to help her daughters before and after birth.
Meghan and her husband should be born in the spring of 2019 to Prince Harry.
The "Mother's World" is in the arena and again shows the noise.
The 16th-time show "Mothers World" has to be kept in place - women publish a long week because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beautiful news are already here - November 8-11, Kauna "Zalgirio" arena.
As the years go by, seeing how the scene changes, shows that it is no longer a series of purchases, but it is a time to give it to itself.
This often becomes the place of friendly meetings and the reason for spending a day with her or her mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - each woman can find out the secrets of her voice, learn the tricks that seem to shine every day, find unchanged products, hear or test various procedures that prevent the process of skin aging.
All of this and more, there are 415 showing participants who will visit all three arenas.
Three days will be a seminar on beauty and health issues, and next day the representatives of the sex will be able to hear advice in a unique way from the style and online editor of Victoria School.
Most women in business are faced with restrictive situations where stress prevents them from becoming stable emotionally and physically.
For this reason, Kauna's trade, industry and office rooms and business women's networks are born with the idea of holding a conference "Transsli and happy. Without stress", where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As in each year, it shows an awareness of events for beautiful masters.
The exhibition's long-standing partners, the Kirpäges Association and the Beauty Specialists Association will give you two days' opportunity to teach hair coloring and modeling subtleties from the international Academy of Vinikurov & Friends, the charismatic gift of S. Maslov and R. Sakalausk.
In order to further improve the scope of the competition for influence creation and the fight against Art Battle, which will not leave any doubt.
There will be a great celebration of the world's beautiful representatives "With Your Birthday, Lithuania", in which a century-long walk will be possible to develop an unprecedented show - from body training to shocks.
Another "Mothers World" tradition will not be forgotten - the presentation of the newest collections on Friday "Made and beauty show", where the collection will be the most stimulant.
And handjobs will be expected in Dekostuja's creative workshops where they will be able to collect original workhouses for the interior or more interested in decorating gifts.
The last day of the show is especially waiting for all the long days, as traditional visitors are delighted with the "World Long-LONG-HAIRD WORLD 2018" competition where the latest long-term cash records are set up each year.
Premier: The wage of teachers after the introduction of an ethical fee increased by 117 euros
Since September's introduction of an ethical payment model, the average wages of the country's pedicants with a total labour load increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulus Skvernel.
"Go ahead and say how much it (in new procedure - BNS) has benefits or shortcomings.
The fact is that people who have full work load - their wages increase by over 117 euros on average," said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the government on the first day.
The Lithuanian Union of Education Workers (LSDPS) plans to implement a strike for ethical payments, he called "democratic law", but stressed that the strike should not impede the process of education.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are allowed.
If it is considered necessary to strike, it is their right to decide.
Only later would it not be possible for children, scientists, to be affected in this area.
If there is a strike, it must be carried out under existing laws," said S. Skvernel.
The Seimas approved a model for the teaching of ethical teachers' work, which was introduced in stages from September.
The teacher's salary has changed - the teacher's grade is 1512 hours per year.
The period of work of the teacher shall be divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. training, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andriaus Navicko, is called absurd, it seems to have adopted the "buldozer" principle and published an indefinite strike starting on 12 November.
The LSDPs require immediately to reject this "minute" pay system and to install a standard model for one stage which would not be more than 18 hours of contact.
Also, the constant rate of payment is to increase 20% and reduce the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new method of allocation of training funds has been criticised because, according to the trade union, there is insufficient funding for home education, for classes to be divided into groups, qualifications, education aid, and for large cities as well as for large cities.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that an ethical teacher's work payment allows for the provision of pedagogical work burdens and for all work for the school community.
It is foreseen that the teacher's etate work for the community will be able to produce up to half the hours per year, the first two years of work - up to 40% of all hours.
It shall be determined that the teacher's working time per week is 36 hours, of which not more than 24 contacts per week are required to teach (for things).
In May, the two-hour strike initiated by the LSDPs contributed about half of the hundreds of general education schools, farms and non-formal education institutions, some 1 000 pedagogues.
There are some 53 000 pedagogues from all over Lithuania.
Calling to be ready: the crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
Economic growth decline and even the crisis can be expected over the next 2-3 years, but both the Lithuanian bank and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, said Vitas Vasiliauskas, president of the Lithuanian Bank Board of Directors in the "Werslo Radio" interview.
"To say that the crisis is already outside the camp, I certainly couldn't, but there are really signs of economic downturn.
This year our country's economy is growing by more than 3 per cent, and the next year it is planning to grow by 2.8 per cent.
The main knowledge I want to say to society and business - let's be ready for anything," said V. Vasiliauskas.
He believes that there are no uniform crises, so they also need different preparation.
The separation of the crisis over the past decade is that at the time, the government believed that income generated by the growing economy would be permanent and that costs were planned.
Thus, after the crisis was halted in 2008, costs had to be drastically reduced.
Now, according to V. Vasiliauska, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"In fact, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already above the potential and we need to press obstacles.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has not done so," said the President of the Council of the Bank of Lithuania.
The upcoming crisis of the country's institutions is estimated at 7 out of 10 votes.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania is being very heavily affected by external factors.
The current outbreak of major tragedies - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly leave us alone.
We must therefore be very open.
In a small economy to say that we are making everything possible, but I am not doing it," said V. Vasiliauskas.
What does the future hold for those who make great loans?
V. Vasiliausko says that the European Central Bank is clearly a short-term strategy, and decisions on change of interest can be expected at least once a year: "The main objective at this time is to try to control expectations".
The trend, which leads to the greatest anxiety to the Head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a reduction in labour hands in our country.
"The reduction in labour hands is a small part of the decision and the reduction of economic competitiveness.
In addition, this will also contribute to the reduction of consumers.
Migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced this year, but does not know whether it was a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliauskas said.
ELTA recalls that both the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will rise by 3.4% this year, and the next by 2.8%.
The Swedish Conservatives' Leader will try to form the government again
On the first day of the election, the President of Parliament announced that Sweden, which has already been in a political shelter for two months after the elections, will have a second chance of forming a government.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) The Central Party belongs to the four right-wing parties of the centre, Aljansu, who received significantly less votes during the 9th meeting than the previous ruling centre.
The two blocks were difficult to overcome when the majority of the parties to the anti-immigrant Swedish Democratic Party, which resulted in the movement of the non-unionized people, refused.
The first attempt by Mr. Kristerson to form the government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, President Stefana Lofvena (Stefanas Lievenas) announced his failure to perform his test.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Parliament President Andreas Norlenas said that the next week he would propose Mr. Kristerson to Parliament as a candidate for the prime minister, thus creating the first vote since the government's formation efforts began.
"I don't know how many parties will accept Ulf Kristerson as prime minister," said journalist A. Norlenas.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamic between the parties must change".
"There must be no negotiations," he added.
Parliament's vote date is not yet clear, but A. Norlenas said that it was 14 November among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may invite a candidate to form a government with which Parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must set up new elections.
The present appointment of Mr. Kristerson is the third test of A. Norlen.
Several parties and Aljanso's Christian Democrats Group pressure Mr. Kristerson to accept the support of the right-wing party of Sweden, but he has not yet denied this opportunity.
Sweden's Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the length of the main party.
The ultra-distance party, successfully taking advantage of the election of voters for immigration following the arrival of nearly 400 000 asylum-seekers from 2012 into the country, requires impact on decision-making in exchange for support.
However, the members of Aljanso are categorically opposed to such ideas by liberal and centralists.
Since 2014, the S. Lofveno Social Democrats Labour Party (SAP) has been in charge of green and non-formal support for the rest of the world, but only if it maintains its Prime Minister's position.
The Alliance and the Party of Swedish Democrats rejected this opportunity.
Delegation of the Afghan Government to the Peace Negotiations in Russia
Following this month's participation in international negotiations on peace in Afghanistan, the delegation of the Cabul Government notified officials on the first day of the month.
The Taliban will consider whether or not to participate in their activities.
On Saturday, Russia announced that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the United States is currently trying to negotiate a bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the end of the 17-year conflict.
The High Council of the Afghan Government, which is responsible for the efforts of combatants to meet four representatives in Moscow, told the AFP representatives of Sayedas Ihsanas Taheri (Sajidas Ihsanas Taheris).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has refused to answer whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still fighting with the Russian officials,' said the representative of Sebastianlah Ahmadi (Sebagutula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts directed by Afghans.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahidas (Zabiula Mužahidas) said that the movement was still under consideration.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of supporting Afghanistan, "substantially involved", AFP said the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Mhamadas Faisalas).
The U.S. Ambassador Kabul has not responded to the request to comment.
The first meeting in Moscow was scheduled for September, but it was postponed to Kabul by demanding that the process be conducted by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in the autumn.
The newly appointed United States peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zaljaus Challzadas) is trying to convince the Taliban to agree on the end of the war and is afraid that a multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine these efforts.
One U.S. Government Supervisory Authority said last week that the Government of Kabul has been weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba Pchenjane met with North Korea's leader
North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Čen Unas) and Cuban President Miguel Diazas-Canalis (Migelis Diasas-Canellis), who both wished to abolish US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their country's strategic relations, the State press in North Korea reported on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canalis, who came to Asia on his first international trip after his arrival in April, returned to Pchenjana with his wife on Sunday.
At the airport, he was welcomed by Kim Jong Unas; the leaders took him to the city for the most part.
The North Korean state press reported that the leaders held negotiations at the national guest houses of Paekhwawon emphasised their country's socialist history and promised further solidarity.
The official press did not provide much details, but it indicated that the atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be considered a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on the issue of North Korea's denuclearization are increasingly difficult.
Pchenjana, who has also been seeking Moscow's approval in recent years, has been a strong rhetoricist before this week's meeting of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's main negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) in New York.
Last week, Pchenjana criticised the United States through its official media about uninterrupted sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used widely against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has managed to further develop a nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change its course.
Sanctions are an important issue for Mr Diazo-Canello's agenda.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canalis discussed nearly 50 million dollars (EUR 43.8 million) of valuable weapons contracts with Russia and received similar Vladimiro Putin's promise to expand political, economic and military relations.
The two Presidents then issued a joint statement referring to the US's "intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states".
The US economic embargo on Cuba, initially introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains valid.
Russians have been subjected to the United States and the European Union sanctions on Crimean anxieties and support for separatists in East Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canellis has to leave Pchenjan on Tuesday.
He's still visiting China, Vietnam and Laos.
In the area of security - cars not safe?
On Saturday, the woman called the police officers, asking them to explain the case of fraud.
According to the newsletter, Hyundai Santa Fe, produced in 2006, remained in the parking lot at the end of September.

During the fire, the seventh high - ranking wall was burned.
Record: The athlete visited Britain within 157 days
The British athlete left the sea on Sunday to the coast of England, becoming the first person to sail across the coast of Great Britain.
At 33 years of age, Rossa Edgley (Rossas Edgelis) spent 157 days at the water and managed 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
He rode in six hours, and he was taken by a crew escort.
Last year, the sportsman succeeded in following hundreds of colleagues' haircuts.
In the newspaper he went to the southern corner of Margeite, England - i.e. R. Edgley started his trip on 1 June.
The sportsman, who was planning to sleep within 100 days, told his trusted relatives on the coast, "Let go, I'm late."
He said that after going to the newspaper, he was first able to make it easier.
"I was very unhappy that my legs wouldn't hold," said the athlete.
In the open waters of the world, the association indicated that R. Edgley, who supported the production of "Red Bull" energy, had not once had to meet with very unpleasant air conditions, and even 37 times the athlete had to prolong the race.

Makabrishka Klebonsk Forest Secret: One suspected already detained
It was a cruel family of past generations because the killer had been severely beaten.
Only in such circumstances was this crime known because the victim had no relatives and was not reported guilty.
According to the first data, he was not expected to become a full-time minister.
Like you're suspected of killing him.
One week later, the Kaunas District Court granted a three - month term.
The second one who is suspected to have fled abroad, where he is excluded from the punishment for another crime, is still seeking.
As long as it is not found, more comments by lawmakers on the circumstances of this crime are not in line.
I. Valinskienė: I agree with many of my children
The most powerful artists in the new building are quickly spreading through the opera "Love and Death in Verona".
The artist team joins Inga Valinskien, who has been entrusted with one of the most important creative roles - a woman known as the Julljeta plant.
An important part of the team was that of Paul Meschkel, who will take care of art.
"I mean, love stories from Shakespeare's times have been created a lot and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet," to see, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will still stand for a long time in different stages.
It will be interesting to be one of these buildings," said I. Valinskienė about a new trial that took place last year.
Although a known woman is well known in the scene, she has not yet played a role in various performances or musicals.
"It's time to play Juliette already,," said I. Valinskienė.
- I'd probably have accepted such a proposal in my own time."
True, the character of the generation in the Shakespeare drama is not least important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The victim is not only an intermediary, the assistant - her manner and tone of speech, a woman’s attitude toward feelings and therefore solidarity with the loved ones gives more and more different colors.
Moreover, the sacrifice is still important because it's only one of the two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The victim's character in my way and style is not very close, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a character other than having its own - is a serious part of the creative process.
Until I know what the final outcome will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation, says I. Valinskienė and reveals that it will probably be achieved in the place of Juliet's garden as well.
- I think the victim listened to her heart.
That's what most women do.
I'd probably do the same."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" is created by the famous V. Shakespeare drama "Romeo and Juliet".
In fact, creation is telling the story of the tragic end of two young people - Rome and Juliet.
The sad ending of the history of the world is the result of an indisputable conflict between young families - the Montenegrins and the Capulets.
"All the time the whole story is possible.
There will always be parents who have sinned against their children’s choice.
Only today's solutions to such problems - diverse - asks whether Rome and Juliet's history can be repeated today, says future scholar I. Valinskienė.
- On my own behalf, I would agree with many things, as well as with the marks."
The role of the actor and director of Ramón Cicáno's mastered hand opera - Romeo and Juliet Juljetos - will also be played by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, as well as by Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutas Cicáns, Mindaguas Papingis, Marius Jampolskis, Paul Sinkūnas and Aidas Barkaskas.
The latest construction of the "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first new coloured legendary design will be developed for the view of Vilnius "Siemens" arena on 28 December.
The next day, on December 29, the hand opera will be shown in the "Fourth" arena of Klaipėda.

Later, however, the prospective football player’s career was halted by injuries.
Two years later, another representative of Kauna Žalgirio, Professor Mark Beneta, was invited to attend the meeting.
In October of October, the nation’s war against Romania and Montenegro was repatriated to the battlefields Egyptidius Vaitkūn and Edvina Girdvanis.
"We will try to get the first points out in the League of Nations, even though it is waiting for very difficult times in the fields of twin-fields.
At home we lost the minimum difference between the Serbs and the Russians.
There was a lack of success.
We hope the guests will be able to wake up.
Although this is a decision for the Russians to fight for the first place in the group and the possibility of continuing the fight for the European Championship," Lithuanian electoral trainer E.Jankauskas said.

"Skamp" presents a song that has already refused a video clip showing one television
During the 20th century, the team "Skamp" has been making music more and more intensively this year.
On 26 December, it was announced that the only Christmas concert "Skamp20" in Vilnius "Siemens" was held in the arena.
This time is "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a loud music video.
"This creature is about love, so I thought that the climate should be equipped with all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sex orientation," explains Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia approach is not normal in 2018.
The new "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video clips have been filming over ten different orientations and ages: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we will not need to discuss this," said Viktor Diawara, who created creative music at the beginning of the year during family vacation in Israel.
In fact, because of this video, "Skamp" has already been able to deal with negative reactions - it does not want to show one of the most popular countries.
This is very much about our society.
Television won't show up because it's where people are staring at and it's not an inappropriate thing for children.
And it's that any morning television can be held on screens and other examples of violence?" asks E. Jennings retrospectively.
Erica and Willius Alessius: "You should like to see more people around you with more hands and arms, regardless of their social situation, sex or age.
We are raising children and want them to grow up in an environment where there are as much tolerance and less tolerance.
The new music and video clips we want to explain to our listeners the day and offer them a drink."
The "Skamp" group has been listening to sound lyrics that have been spoken with non-popular or opiate themes since 1998.
The best of all groups - old and new - music will play loud and wide "Skamp20" concert in the Vilnius "Siemens" arena on 26 December.
It is expected of all families, and children up to 10 years of age are free of charge.

President: LRT is not a political property
In order to return to the work of the Commission's review of the findings of the Commission which have examined the LRT, the Presidency notes that the authorities are only seeking to obtain more political control for the public broadcaster.
"The human translator is non-political property, and the fundamental principle is this independence from politics," explained President Mindauga Ling, "The Knowledge Radio."
However, the consultant stressed that the opposition process can be taken into account at this time.
"It is possible to see that this (political. - ELTA) impact needs to be more.
This is also considered sufficiently critical," said Mr. Ling.
According to him, the proposals made by the Sieme LRT Commission are questionable and questionable, as they apply to the independence of the broadcaster.
Although Mr Ling stressed the need to improve LRT management, it should be carried out on the basis of expert assistance and through the search for specific aspects that hinder LRT activities.
He stressed that the international authorities are already stressing that LRT should be monitored, not political, but the competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the findings of the Commission's review of the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions have led to many criticisms.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT are very objectively assessed - reducing the powers of the Council and extending its membership terms to the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In this regard, the European Union has been concerned.
The opposition group of Seima members called on the Constitutional Court to consider whether the Special Parliamentary Commission is not opposed to the Constitution.
Foreign speakers - good news from R. Karbauski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Place of residence of former member states of Lithuania and of the Green Union, submitted by Mr Ramón Karbauski, whose citizens, workers and taxpayers outside Lithuania, would be exempt from payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
After the presentation, 56 Seima members stayed on Tuesday, and 25 parliamentarians stayed before the 9th.
Following the discussion of the draft in the Seima plenary meeting, Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusions on 6 December.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation are exempt from payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the State Social Insurance Institution.
Those living and working in non-Lithuania, according to the procedures laid down by the State Social Insurance Fund Board (‘Sodra’) and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be deemed to have departed from Lithuania.
It is about services that are not used by man.
There is an additional possibility of finding out that a person has gone," explained R. Karbauski from the Seima tribe.
Such a proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservative of the Seimas, Antana Matolu, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Dalis uses it for Lithuanians living abroad," noted A. Matulas.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss believes that this is how we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, assumptions would be made for wise people to use the health protection system free of charge.
Following adoption of the proposed legislative amendment, the social insurance benefits for persons who have moved to another country will be paid without any borrowings, and the burden of the administration of Sodros debt will be eased.
At present, citizens of Lithuania who have actually left Lithuania but who have not declared a declaration of departure in the Register of Residents in accordance with the procedure laid down by the legislation are eligible for compulsory health insurance (PSD) payments every month and if they are not paid, they are covered by debt.
A. Data on fraud, but justified on fraud
The Court of First Instance remained in force for a decision on the grounds of appeal against the former famous sportsman Alvyda Donoël, but it was justified on the basis of the burden of documents.
On Monday, the judge who was responsible for the proceedings was brought before the court immediately.
A. Data shall be set free for a period of four and a half years from the date of release of the sentence.
This year, the city of Vilnius was tried by the court of the city of Vilnius on a number of occasions by the Lithuanian army.
It was sentenced to a period of four and a half years.
The Court of First Instance, which had examined the case in the light of the case, dismissed one charge, but the same sentence remained.
The former sportsman will also have to pay almost EUR 760 for the Offenders from the Crime Fund.
In 2013, Prosecutor A. Doonėl claimed that he was a member of the vector, which he loaned 200 thousand lithium (about EUR 58) to his former wife, Dalia Burocaite, the head of the Odontology Department.
This was the case only in December 2016 when he received an invitation to cover inflation.
An ex-wife told the requirements of the money clinic that he had never given up on him and that he had never been sick.
The case does not contain objective data that prove that A. Donoëla is inaccurate of the fact that it is not a UAB "Dalezia" owed to A. Donoëla 200 thousand litres.
In accordance with the arguments presented by the judge and his defence officer, there are no objective data supporting this case.
In this way, when it was found that A. Ddonëla used only the document which had been drawn up and recognized that these signs - the use of the document in question - were part of a complex breach (in the case of a return), A. D. Dãoëla was justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Penal Code, without showing that he was involved in the criminal act," says the judgment of the Court of Auditors.
He led the land in a fire - he heard the cry for three days
As reported by the Kauna Community Anti-Fraud Board of Rescue, it was reported that three days of smoking was banned after the change in heat pipes.
When the fire broke out, they also heard the sound of a cat.
It has been explained that a few days ago, the heatway repair works were being carried out here.
It is believed that two chains could have been turned over on land by crossing the road after the crossing.
He suddenly turned off the heat track, which was located at the foot of a meter, and he pushed his gear out of the cat.
The son of Antonino Scalia says his father doesn't see any liberal protests about Kavanaugh
Judge Antonino Scalia of the Supreme Court told the agency "Fox News" that his father would not be surprised by the protests of coastal forces against the appointed judge, Brett Kavanaugh, because Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was too much into the affairs of the modern world.
“In general, it would not have been very surprised at his nomination to the Supreme Court, since many who support Roe's case before Wade – at least that is already the case –” said Christopher Scalia, referring to the 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was confirmed in certain trimesters.
Roe's case, one by one, has deprived all States of the right to regulate abortions for themselves and some countries, in response to this decision, suddenly tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe tried to solve cultural problems, even though they had to be dealt with through elections and the legislative process," he added during the exhibition on Fox & Friends."
"In order to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has added even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and the dispute on approval give rise to a more significant reaction, as lawyers are acting as lawmakers."
In a meeting held this month on the approval of Kavanaugh, the Nebrassian Senator Benas Sasse expressed a similar opinion, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to the executive authorities that are not in fact accountable, and many bureaucratic issues remain before the Supreme Court, so the judges have to take a job that the senators refuse.
The capital police arrested and charged hundreds of protestors about the illegal movement into the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid an adverse reaction due to the unaccompanied sexual harassment he had committed several decades ago, Scalia said that he would not be able to avoid it as soon as possible.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because on Thursday during the senator's interview, he reacted angrily and sometimes – calls, Scalia wondered whether all the judges were of a good nature.
"Justices don't get upset," Scalia said, referring to the bitter disagreements that sometimes occur in conflicting cases.
‘Well, judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was different.
He tried to hide his good name from unconfirmed charges."
On Thursday, most of the party's votes (11 against 10) were allowed to participate in the entire Senate vote.
Senator Jeffas Flake of the Arizona Republics made a dramatic announcement that his decisive vote would be delivered to Kavanaugh only if the FTB would be given a week for investigations into the current alleged breach of charges uttered by Kavanaugh.
The investigation continued, and President Trupas said that the Agency was given a wide range of powers and that it could ask "what had been panicked".
"Schiapalli" in the collection of ready-made clothing – fantastic dishes
Is surrealism possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris model houses, which Elsa Schiaparelli built nearly a century ago, provided its first collection of ready - made clothing and handmades.
Fantastics, and not wearing prepared clothing for a favorite brand, this collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsos Schiaparelli transforms the shape of the boat.
An excentrificent picture of a long - running house of buildings has now been shown and how very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find feelings, ambitions, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparlli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer to track the music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali agreed to reconcile me and my mother, and now Calvin Klein and Rafa Simons, co-operated with American artist Sterling Ruby, took this idea.
The legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli and the motive of the omora, wanted to exaggerate the real minority before the demonstration, but did not accept it.
Black wore without shoes with Mano Ray's design "Electricité" on the seat.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not different from the history of "Schiapalli", said Bertrand Guyon, director of creation for the last three years, speaking at the building hall in Vandomo Square.
By creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he supported Schiaparelli in his friendship with My Ray and, in cooperation with My Ray's Foundation, he created clothes according to well-known art creations.
A picture of the artist's eyes adapted to the "Styl's hair" is shown on the markers painted by "Perspex" and the red flowers from "Observatory Time: Lovers" with the slcography method printed on the right silk shirt with cholera.
My Ray's "Style Dog" on the collection markers
One of Elso's changes was an attractive touch for the creation of S. His business color – "Schoking Rose" inspired her beads "Schoking".
The first "Schiaparelli" by Guyon Kurta is a hand with a hand on the hand on the bag called "Paslatis".
Its minimum price will also be fantastic – £5000.
Last night, a temporary shop opened on the left-hand side in the warehouse of Old Town, where a surrealist half a week in Paris was shown and 100 € was available for purchase of Virgilo Abloho's accommodation from the Ikea collection that will soon show.
The remaining half hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans marched on the line on the docks, without interrupting to buy one of the most beautiful of his creations, rather than his man-made clothes “Louis Vuitton”.
This project helps Ablohu to achieve a wider audience than is available for a large audience or designers to create furniture.
“No one has any property, but knowledge of a particular box can help to stop the conversation at the south table.
This is what he thinks is a thousand years old," he recently said.
At the meeting in the Marais region, observers realized that this garage would not be used when models began to drive them on wheels.
The collection of men and women's colourings of the single Westwood man designer Andreas Kronthallerie was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul filmmakers.
Some women (and a number of men) who had been exposed to occult practices were riding on bicycles, but they came on their own at the top of the floating platform.
Westwood, watching the show in the first row and putting a collection dress with horse motives and orange over a cord tied to his chest, joined his husband, offering her a cup of tea.

Detroit was born and Peter Zelewskis, who lived in London, was already confirmed as a street photographer when he started photographing two four years ago.
“I like the photographer and the people, who always played two and a lot of the things they talk about,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but he said, "after photographing the first two portraits I acquired independence and there was no way back."
In the book of Zelewski, The Two will soon print 44 identical two - pair photographs and stories.
This project is more visual, he says: "This is not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to photograph the effects and sensitive portraits of people."
The service providers filed a lack of confidence in the professional union in connection with the wage negotiations
Members of the Royal Service College failed to meet the professional union deal with the National Health Service on wages, after the vote they failed to meet the Union and charged it with the express requirements for the increase in the salary expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after the resumed discussions in the Royal Service College, when his former Secretary-General Janet Davies falsely promised members that their payments would increase by 3 per cent this year, when 1 per cent of the wage limit would be lifted.
In the meantime, the members were arrested and forced to quit their duties, and on Friday they filed an urgent meeting in Birmingham, after which they requested a meeting of the College Council.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has helped to clarify relations, so the college will only be strengthened," said Maria Trewern, director of the Royal Service College.
“Balsaming clearly and the Council of the Kingdom Service College and the leadership understood the information sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already sought changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include members; we will continue our efforts to implement this."
The meeting will take place next week and is expected to be suspended by the members of the Governing Body of the Kingdom Service Committee.
"The basis of services is trust," said the national health service service provider to the newspaper "Guardian".
‘The actions of the Royal College of Services Council have undermined its confidence, and the Council must therefore cease.
I hope she'll meet with great respect and ask for a request.
I wonder if other members of the trade unions will also be able to resolve."
In the National Health Service of the General Professional Union, Rachel Harrison said in August "Guardian," "I've got a pay, the National Health Service staff from all over the country realized the unexpected challenge.
It caught them."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the Royal Service College acknowledged that it had contributed to errors in the 2018 remuneration negotiations and had made it publicly known.
However, it is also claimed that the Royal Service Campaign on Restriction of Taxation has forced the Government to reject this restriction and to promise to increase the wage by 6.5 per cent within three years.
The vote was taken after an independent study, which found that the college was willing to open negotiations and Davides was accused of insufficiently evaluating the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal Service College provided incorrect information and therefore the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published conflicting information on whether all employees will receive a 3% increase in wages.
In the short report before the collegiate meeting, representatives were mistakenly said that the planned "3% increase and increase in progress in the implementation of the reform" was planned.
In fact, the wage had to be gradually increased to 3% and only some of the highest wage workers would be expected to increase immediately.
"The information provided to the members on the implementation of the transaction after the merger was incorrect (mostly because it was tried to simplify it),” said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service, who conducted the study.
"In the opinion of the ERA, the decision-making countries did not understand and fully explain the differences between existing systems and the proposed transaction and did not clearly indicate the main benefits, including the figures of 6,5 % and 29 % mentioned during the campaign, so it was not possible to adopt a reasoned decision."
The decision was adopted by 78 per cent of the votes cast, and 3.74 per cent of the members of the Royal Service College participated in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of the direct transliteration of Instagram by trying to "get" children out of the family
Lindsay Lohan was critical of the direct transliteration of Instagram, which she followed in the street by the tribe of Benjamin and tried to separate their sons from their fathers.
At first, the actor offered to rent a place for the family at night, but the situation quickly deteriorated.
"Hello everyone! I want to show you what family I have met," she told the observers, "that refugees from Syria are very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Would you like to go with me?
“ I’ll take care of you, ” she told the family before she said to one of the children, “Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch movies?
It would be difficult to watch a movie through television or computer."
When the parents gave up, Lohan reacted in a negative way.
“Your children should not be in the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them houses and a place of sleep as I am now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't mess with me."
When the family tried to break up from Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through the Instagram.
"Look what you do is trade for children. So you are pursuing an Arab culture.
They're going to take the kids, though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now we're seeing the whole world."
The translation ended the physical confrontation – it seems that the mother was running Lohan.
The video recorders appeared in the social media and some of the users were wondering if this could not be compared to the test.
The Independent contacted the representative of Lohan for comments.
Third British thinks you'll never pay all the debts you owe.
Nearly a third of the world’s people believe that they will not be able to cover their own debts during their lifetime, and one person in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, which revealed only The Independent, showed that the British, in particular the 18-24-year-old group, believed that all life would have debts and only half of them expected to be released from them.
In the past year, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Research shows that students who have completed their studies are left with about 46,000 loans and that the poorest students are more than 57,000 euros in debt.
Most graduates (81 per cent) will never pay all debts, so the first 30 years of work are under pressure to borrow.
Public loans increase: According to data from the National Statistics Department, the debt of the United Kingdom's families is record size and Britain spends an average of £900 more each year than work.
But is it worth any concern about this poor statistics?
Is life - threatening debt just a new way of life for young adults (and for all society) throughout the ages?
As an example, it can be mentioned that cars that are other famous buyers will buy houses (if such success is achieved).
Auto Trader predicted this week that all new cars would be transported significantly over a decade – this would be the usual way to buy vehicles.
Director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
"At these times, it is quite normal to have loans: credit cards have been popular, interest rate refinanced, student loans and fast loans," she said.
"Our ancestors were sometimes willing to have debts."
At this time, student loans and housing prices have become a normal phenomenon.
This claim is also supported by Moira O'Neill, head of the Personal Finance Division of the Interactive Investor, who believes that the results can lead to anxiety.
‘If you borrow a large amount that exceeds your income four or five times, it can prove that the additional debt is nothing,’ she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so large loans or other loans have to be taken into account for the safety of people, which would happen if the standards were to be met."
It may not be necessary to monitor that financial industry commentators have no doubt.
Brian Brodie, Executive Director of Freedom Finance, says: "The debt is not a taboo.
The loan for house repair or new car purchases shall not be made at the latest.
As a result of low interest rates, many people have contributed savings to longer-term investments, which result in a higher return, but not so easy to get saved money.
As a result, the middle class is becoming more and more secular.
Over the past six months, about half of the new loans have been received by customers with excellent credit rating."
Richard Haymess, head of the TDX Group's Financial Solution Section of Equifax, believes that such expectations — not to lose all life from debt — really lead to anxiety.
He says: “Effective inflation was the largest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rate growth, and employment was relatively high, so many people do not take credit for their decision without a realistic plan of return.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of people will increase by 17 per cent, and the key factor is recording consumer debt."
The debt may not be much of a concern as long as a person works and works, but it is not clear how the whole life of the loan will be affected by his well - being in the past.
A study by the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out together with the money borrowed by the More 2 Life specialists, showed that the unencumbered debt of 55-74 people has increased by more than a third over the last four years, i.e. more than twice as high as the country average.
This age group spends most of its time on credit cards and spends 30 per cent more each month than on employment.
Boyle adds: “All more people in their 55 ’ s choose to pay their pensions and that will affect their living at home.
Most often it is the single stocks which they 'requireded to save'.
In addition, people believe that the use of wealth will later lead to wealth, but change in wealth will not result in less money than is expected.
If there's a price crisis, this situation will only be difficult."
SERENA Williams developed "I Touch Myself" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video recording in which she played the classic "Divinyls" song with the hand "I Touch Myself" with a heavy burden.
Tenniso’s eyes shared the click on his Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their breasts.
"This month I wrote The Divinyls in the World’s version I Touch Myself in order to remind women to check on themselves regularly," William wrote.
“That is how I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects all ethnic women around the world.
Most important of all, it helps to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the I Touch Myself Project, which is implemented by the famous Chrissy Amphlett honor – she died of breast cancer and gave us her emergency to remind women first of her health."
The project under the label ‘Berlei for Broken Cancer Network Australia’ (BCNA) was supported by Amphlett’s death in 2014.
The video, published by the Tennis Star in its Instagram section, attracted more than 1.5 million views and audiences for how the tennis player played the song.
"You're going to have to hang out for this clip and your right to do it.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one respecter.
Another added: “Serena, it’s NOOSTAB.
About 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a fever myself, even when my mammograms didn’t show up.
It's just necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone - you're a real bitch!"
The Berlei project I Touch Myself Project also released a new life-sit paper called The Chrissy, which was inspired by the star.
100 % of the profits obtained after the sale of the fine will be charged to BCNA.
In self-check, it is important to know what signs and symptoms should be searched.
The signs of breast cancer are not only small but also changed in the size or shape of the chest, joints or joints, except for spinal cord, skin surface fittings, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, it may be possible to alert the cancer of the wound or of the radical, the swelling of the veins and the spinal cord.
Women are advised to check their breasts every month.
Following any signs of breast cancer, NHS is advised to contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor has decided that your symptoms need to be further evaluated, he will take you to a heart cancer clinic.
Adams Driver has forced the entire SNL film group to quatto
Adam's Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" wedding star and really tried to get everyone to dance.
The best quality drawings are usually not related to a particular event – as is the new exhibition called "Day of Career".
A U.S. high school day is depicted when students take their parents away, and adults of Mortdecai (Pete's Davidson) do not want to agree that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), would say the language.
Lazdele, who was able to inspire megalomanian personality, Daniel's Day-Lewiss actor, Daniel Plainviews, from the film 'Bash Blood', says pictures of how he managed the oil industry.
“I was born seven months earlier,” Parnasus told his students.
“Incubators’ technologies were just scattered, so I was put in a few yards and heated in a pizza oven until I learned how to walk.
My bones didn't break like this, but not my spirit!
Be strong and defeat your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague, SNL actor Aidy Bryant, who played the teacher, just didn't feel connected and couldn't look at the driver in the eye.
However, the role of the "Star Wars" actor is just running away and he starts to talk about a personal war with another oil magnet H.R. Pickins.
"I've got your ring!" he shouts.
"I have filled her womb with my trying seeds and cursed your boy, this is my final kiss, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes, the training became the same as that of Adam Driver’s character as that of Kyle Renas from two films.
"Be cursed, H. R.!"
Set Kendricko Lamaro music: On the Internet show eight unheard of creatures
It seems that there was a lot of unsolved Kendrick Lamar music.
On Saturday, eight of them were still unheard of by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas.
The name of the collection ‘Bad Kid Chill City EP’ and the above illustration (which was most recently created by the admirer) are not clear.
It may be that only demonstration and uncompleted versions of music that are thus interfering with different ranges of Lamaro's career can be identified.
"Gang Member" could belong to "Good Kid Maad City" and "Heroin", composed together with SZA, similar to "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs are distributed in the collection:
‘Gang Member’;
‘The Only Nigga’;
‘Want In Life’;
‘Loved Ones’ (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rock, Isaiah Rashat and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted the representative of Kendrick Lamaro for the comment.
The event about the music "Chiikaga": No tickets will be left in Klaipėda, inviting you to go to Vilnius or Kauna
Lithuanians want to see Klaipėda's national musical theater "Chiikaga" - no question.
For this reason, the best-known Lithuanian musicians of all ages have moved to another location across the country’s largest arena.
However, after about 1.5 months before the show, the halls are scheduled to arrive.
The organizers announce that all tickets to the music area of Klaipėda "Vivtura" have already been sold, the tickets are quickly solved and the exhibitions of Kauna "Zalgirio" and Vilnius "Siemens" arenas.
We invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there is still a few tickets.
The exhibitions will take place in December, so you will not only see our music from now on, but also have a great opportunity to look at the evluts of the largest cities in the country," Laima Vilimaenė, head of the state theatre of Klaipėda, offers to the musicians.
The "Cikkagos" views will depend on the changes in the composition of the artists.
For the first time, one of the main musical roles was entrusted to the actor Tom Zaib.
The talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago is Billy Flynn - the best and most influential lawyer in Chicago without changing people's lives.
Since Klaipėda’s National Music Theater’s "Chiikaga" music is adapted to larger areas, arenas, the artist’s list is also larger than the creation shown in Broadway.
In Lithuania, in Chicago, horses show half the artists.
The main role of women is to believe in the greatest performers of Klaipėda's National Music Theater Beatai Ignatavicít (who killed Velma Kelly) and the charismatic Kauna Music Theater Gabriele Bilskyte (who killed Roxie Hart).
The music "Chiikaga" depicts the third - century C.E. Chicago criminal world, which turns the prison wall into the language of the stars.
It's the content of the punishment of the music about the killers seeking attention and recognition.
Music has been poisoned by sexual immorality and irony.
It doesn't matter where there are and what is done by the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - shine in the bright star.
Their life is a life of knowledge on the first page, of title, glitter, fame...
On December 13th, "Chikaga" will appear in the "Swift" arena of Klaipėda, on December 18th - Kauna "Zalgirio" arena, on December 20th - Vilniaus "Siemens".
Ticket plate "Tiketa".
Website furniture in Kaune
The site can be called a representative home area where we allow time with friends, welcome guests and Mr. So it should be arranged so that it is not only comfortable for home and family members but also for guests.
Depending on the size, size of the site, walls, or decoration, family walls should be selected.
The site should be not only beautiful but also comfortable.
The best thing to do is move the interior designer, which will help the space to be optimally filled so that it will not be overloaded or turned back - too empty.
It is recommended to establish, first, the main site point, i.e. the other details to which you will combine your furniture.
This may be a joke or other important topic of the website.
It would also be good to create a chat room where guests can enjoy pleasant association so as not to interfere with local dishes and dishes.
Sofos, cassettes should be set up close to each other so that your guests can join and speak.
Thus, the formation of balsam must promote cooperation, unite people, and not separate them from one another.
Don't stand by the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance from the wall.
Even if the room is small and you still have at least a few places from the wall, don’t touch the walls.
If room space is large, leave more space from the wall.
Actually, the higher the distance, the better.
Create a balance when drawing furniture
Consider the various details that will be available on your website.
All elements must be negotiated in one another.
The web pages must be aligned with the internal details.
A possible low contrast.
He'll be late for the website, but he shouldn't be too big because it's going to be inconsistencies.
We'd always need to feed on the inside of the designers.
When creating a website, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you are risking falling apart to extremes: or you will create an intestine because you are afraid to experiment, cheat, choose incorrectly or persist improvised.
Adequate lighting
That is something very important.
Because different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting must be provided at different levels: the ceiling lamps, the wall lamps, on the basis of the building lamps.
The Prosecutor challenged the judicial decision of the Heads of the LKF
The Vilnia District Court has challenged the judicial decision of Vilnius District Court to the leaders of the former Lithuanian Krepska Federation (LKF).
As the prosecutor reported on Monday, the complaint indicates that the municipality of the city of Panjevje had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panjevje.
A preliminary study found that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of a hotel, a contract for the purchase and sale of services was concluded in 2010 between the municipalities of the Lithuanian Krepsk Federation and the city of Panjevjez.
The Prosecutor claims that the services which the federation had to provide to the municipality of the city of Panjevjes under that contract were not and could not be provided, since the provision of services had already been received or financed by the State and the beneficiaries, part of the events already occurred before the contract had been signed and paid out of other funds, and part of the events had already occurred after the publication of the VAT invoices - cash according to the invoices were transferred for outstanding events.
In the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the Vilnia District Court argues that the State itself has committed itself to the municipality of Paneveži to reconstruction of a private hotel, since no State obligation for a particular hotel has been expressed to the municipality of Paneveži as soon as possible to address the issues of the development of the hotel required for the workshop.
In the Court’s view, the Court found that the leaders of the LKF and the municipality of Panama tried to fulfil the State’s obligation without having access to legal means, since the data available in the case showed that it was possible to organize the massacres of the European Task Force in other cities without violating the laws.
The Vilnia District Court of Appeal has requested the annulment of the Court of First Instance's judicial decision and, in this case, the new decision on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On 15 October, the Court of Auditors fully condemned all crimes committed by the General Secretary-General of the LKF Mindauga Balchijun.
This is related to the preparation of the European men's basketball championship held in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr Balchiun was charged with abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor-General of the LKF claimed that he had agreed with the Federal Financial and Executive Director on behalf of the Federation to include, on behalf of the Federation, the transfer of documents and other official accounts, financial documents and accounts relating to the services provided by the LKF to the municipality of Panjejez.
The pre-trial investigation carried out by the officials of the Special Research Service (STT) of the Paneväži Council, data showed that the funds of the municipality of Paneväže in the city of Paneveži could be surrounded and covered by the benefits of LKF managed and later used for the reconstruction of the "Romantic" hotel of Via Unica.
The hotel's director, Dalia Kuklierienė, was accused of buying - she was suspected to have given M. Balchijuno television as a treasure.
All people with Mr. Baltiwan are entitled to justice.
The charges in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Krepsik Federation.
Job location - tassi Bermuda trip
In Lithuania, the number of people who have been injured or killed since 1992 has already exceeded the total population of Alytaus and is estimated to be 83 000.
If the requirements for specific physical jobs and their safety are clear and clear, this will be the choice of the new Bermuda trip to work away from home, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance professionals, although the Law on Safety and Health of Workers provides for remote work for workers to obtain safety and health conditions that do not distinguish from other employees of the company, the diversity of modern forms of work may lead to a number of questions, which are recorded in the press report.
After an accident in the building, the employer pays for the first two working days of 80 per cent compensation and for the rest of the period "Sodra".
If it is found that an accident occurred at work, Sodra shall pay 100% of the wages from the first day of unemployment.
In assessing the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and BTA, it is obvious that most of the accidents and various injuries occur at work.
These are often various physical works where the risk of damage is higher: they are treated with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, even the offices where most of the most demanding, well-paid professionals are now facing their own challenges, which are given to employers and which are very popular for the freedom of mobility of workers," says the head of the BTA Human Resources Management Section, Jevgenija Kristikunė.
It is recommended that legislation in force in Lithuania clearly regulate the duties and responsibilities of the worker, define the working time, place and functions, and that it is in force and in a far-reaching way.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
There are indeed various situations and trends, each case being examined individually.
Employees have often heard of the fact that responsibility for the employer is required when attending or from work meetings or when traveling to work because of an accident.
In this case, however, there are very few opportunities for young people, so I would encourage both workers and workers to start conversations, to understand and to make maximum clear and acceptable to both parties what situations are really considered to be an accident at work and which will already have the status of housing injuries," the specialist advises.
J. Kristian says that during these times when working functions are often fully sufficient for computer and mobile phone and stable Internet connection, the employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work not at home at the same time, but by making coffee in a coffee shop or park while enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a job, isn't it?
What if the hours under discussion are not in accordance with the agreement provided for?
It can really be complicated by situations of non-exhaustive nature which help explain the circumstances of the study initiated by Sodros or State Labour Inspections," says a specialist.
In their view, the main difference between the event’s work and future is the amount of unemployment benefit.
J. Kristian acknowledged that it was necessary to hear informal experiences while workers were trying to hide the true circumstances of accidents or injuries and to try to involve workers in medical care without work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus undermining financially.
This is unfair, disrespectful attitude towards the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the aforementioned mobility encourages the search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: this is also the risk of the employer's civil liability for damage to workers, the risk of accidents from injury, disability or even death, as well as the current and health insurance," says J. Kristiansunė.
Mobile signature system is running again
After removing the broadcast on the first day of July, the mobile signature system was re-implemented by the BNS by representatives of the service provider "SK ID Solutions" of the Estonian IT company.
This company reported disturbances on the morning of the first day, experienced inconveniences by "Bitė", "Telia" customers and the share of "Tele2" users.
The problems to be fixed in Estonia, but the representatives of the "SK ID Solutions" could not comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian Rehabilitation Collection - Polish lessons
European Trophy dividends are due to the Lithuanian Rebion Group as long as it is difficult to achieve a level playing field at a higher level.
The "Trophy" division in the Old Land is a third in terms of capacity after the six-nation tournament and the European Championship.
This is where 13-18 country teams with ratings are running.
The liturgy of the Lithuanians started a syllable in the north front of the Czech team at 30:10.
And last week, Lithuania's election was held in the House of Commons, where it is not connected to the Polish election - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians fought in the war, they often violated the rules in the camps and were punished by the Polish rebels.
3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of trial was carried out by Wojciecha Piotrovichius, who gave his own 12 points of weight.
On the first floor, the Lithuanians had to play without the yellow card received by Tautvyd Majill.
A number of attacks were carried out on the second floor, but they were not successfully completed.
At the time, the flames were able to break our defenses.
The pressure of the camel in the reading area was made by Mateusza Plichta, later by Christian Pogorzelski and Mateusza Adamski.
In addition to a number of important players, the Lithuanian picker from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantage of the winners and said that such tournaments gave many valuable experiences.
"The lines played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay in these camps for as long as possible.
We just put it at this higher level and we have to simplify it.
We won the first rounds before the checks, but now we had a very strong fighter and had to acknowledge their advantage.
Poland's election has given us valuable lessons," said a specialist from the PAR, who has been in Lithuania for four years.
Another round "Trophy" division Lithuanians play at home with Portuguese or Romanian on 6 April 2019.
This division is still underway by the Dutch and Swiss forces.

Japan's coastal protection is intensely searching for densely populated islands
Esanbe Hanikata Kojima - this name was given in 2014 to the small island in northern Japan.
A small, barren and unsatisfied island, which was essentially inappropriate for life, was very important for Japan.
Is it so important that she now has a dense territory that is intensely visible - perhaps still happening?
Why does Japan need these islands so much?
It won't happen.
It is likely that the ice and the waterfalls have flooded this island all the time, although it is still on the water’s surface nearly six feet [2 m] above sea level.
There is no doubt that the island is simply confused, but at least its feet are expected to be found.
When no one knew exactly what the island began - it was so wild that no one was too much on it.
The first about Esanbe Hanikata Kojima was discovered by Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as a means of visual navigation.
Their disappearance is not even a tragedy for these fish as there are better ways to catch where fish can be caught and where Russian waters begin to fight.
In fact, this was also true of Esanbe Hanakit Kojima.
This dirty land hole was the very nightly signature of the island of Kurillas.
This island resort, known by Russia as the Kurillas Islands, and Japan - Northern Territories.
The conflict with these interruptions continued from the mid-19 ’ s, but the full force was absorbed at the age of 20.
There are natural resources in these areas, but Japan also believes that the islands should belong to it.
The fact is that Japan has been researching these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They first made a map, taking more detailed studies, registering many small islands.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that the latter were in line with Sakhalin and Japan - all the islands of the Curylians.
So these two states lived until 1905 when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and extended the island of Kurillas.
Japan, including large claims in the whole island, does not mean, although it was the first one, but it would like to have four islands - Iturupo, Kunashia, Šikotan Islands and Chabomajas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island has experienced the first time, and it belongs to Japan in accordance with the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed for Russia to divide these four islands by level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is close to the North Territories, but now this geographical link has been lost.
Dingo is a physical sign of Japan’s presence in those waters.
This is a major loss, so the rest of the island is sought.
However, even after they have been found by Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, they will not conform to the general definition of the island - it must be dry.
This means that Japan will gradually reduce its territory and significantly reduce the exclusive economic area from the stock.
I'm just interested in what the island search mission looks like - it's really not going to be this way or that way.
Incredible drama in the Lithuanian and Polish box of elections
More than a week had to wait for the final judge who became the winner of an international meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxers.
There were nine Polish and Lithuanian twins in Poland.
The four prisoners won Lithuanians, both - and - the-lines.
At the end of the two-year term, however, the final decision of the long-standing panel of judges and the secretary of the frauds secretariat was brought to an end.
The meeting began with the victory of the Lithuanian boxers.
The Lithuanian champion Marius Vjšniauska (weight category up to 52 kg) secured 3:0 defeated Jakub Surma, shortly after Edgar Skullis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radomir Obrušniak after the second battle.
Two family heads followed: Damiana Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 won Manta Dužina, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 won Simon Bana.
Vytautas Balssys (up to 75 kg) returned to Lithuania’s collection.
Lithuania 2:1 killed Bartosz Golebiesk.
In the second battle, Peter Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) won the third round with a clear victory over Egypt's Deaths and the result was again at 3:3.
He followed Jokoli’s brothers closely.
Robert Jokulys (up to 91 kg) 3:0 killed Andrzej Kolton, and Arvydas Jokulys (over 91 kg) had already had to acknowledge Adam's Kuli's advantage in the first round.
Most of the discussions resulted in the fight against Tado Tamashausk (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting was interrupted by more than a week.
One judge gave a victory to the lion, two judges to Lithuania, but because of the technical error of one judge to Lithuania, the point was read to Mr Soczynski.
After a long struggle, the victory was left for the Polish boxer 2:1.
At the Lithuanian and Polish elections, the result of the victory was 10:8 (after victory 2 points) for family members.
They were able to expose the Lithuanians to the tragic loss of the past match.
At a meeting held in Marijampoła in 2015, Lithuanian boxers won even five of the six and won the prize. 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian electoral leaders in Poland was the general rehearsal of the Lithuanian box championship held on 14-17 November.
After the country's presidency, a new Lithuanian box will be set up, which will undermine the country's respect for the world and for European championships that will take place next year.
How does a sheep’s discerning of a man’s steps lead him to do so?
You already know that the dog is very sensitive.
They can contain hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even known diseases by smell.
Very well known and filmed dog breeds, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine which step the owner has taken?
In fact, this question is more difficult than you think.
There are three phases of the lead eight – the creation, the setting of the direction and the lifting.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide what steps a person has taken.
Because there's no way out of the different steps or seconds, so their smell doesn't get very different, right?
Not at all.
The experiment described in the study of the University of Oslo in 1990 was carried out by a 90-degree camp in the trajectory that passed by man.
Tests to be performed on the stomach and on the asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily set a human direction of movement, even when he tried to explain them by means of transient repellent.
Can you imagine how difficult this would be for you?
The gap between the current current footprints is very low and in time it decreases even more.
However, scientists say that this has not changed so much - dogs could tell which part of the earth was the first.
This is because their door is an incredible tool.
Smegenys dominates the area responsible for the bear (as our brains dominates the regions responsible for the rule).
Dogs have 125-300 millionquapo receptors.
In general, dogs’ eggs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but they play an even greater role in their ability to interpret different flavors.
Scientists then performed analogous experiments and with the left leg of the bikes, but their approach to dogs was much more difficult.
This is because bicycling cancer is not segmented as an existing human leg, so it is more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of eggs.
This title would soon match the title.
A hundred miles [100 km] of white lobes follow a course of preparation and red lobes absorb even a strong animal for 30 km.
In private forests, it is called for to regulate attacks
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navick will explain on Tuesday about deforestation in Seime.
At the end of June, the public's failure to comply with the forest in the regional park of Labanor was due.
For the month, these forests were stopped.
The Minister has acknowledged that the labanore investigations have shown that serious violations have not been committed.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced restrictions in view of the proposal of the Working Group to intensify forest destruction in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister calls for other legislation to be drawn up to the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to apply to forest-based national forests as well as to private forest management.
Agnä Jajalavićė has highlighted the strategy of 170 thousand followers
People need to give what they want, and at the same time ruin what they want themselves, the LRT television series "Culturally With Nomeda" says Agnė Jajalavićėtė.
According to the stylist, it was gradually subjugated by a large minority of respecters.
"From the beginning I've thanked the man's back, step by step, and for the time running after the back of that back," says A. Jajalavićitė.
A. Jagelavičitė has more than 170 thousand followers in his feisbuk area - she has achieved this number using a certain strategy: "From the beginning I've applied to the human stage, to myself, for a short time running after that stage is good."
Stylist A. Jajalavicchiutė claims that there is no such thing as uncertainty, so it shows its face as it is, - the authenticity and ability to find the best way to present it is the most important criteria for popularity on social networks.
She notes that social networks do not have a human culture, because many people turn to them in order to find out or read some of the comments of other disparaging people: "For example, in childhood there was a goal when I wanted to dance with everyone and change - now I don't want to do it."
"Truth life is the most terrible thing.
And there is a lot of this in social networks.
Feisbuke is less than an instagram," she says.
A. Jagelavičićė says that a specific know-how on social networks is about women's emancipation.
It also announces the production of journals and takes into account creation in its work.
"I can't say that the fashion magazine is a pure art expression, but I know that there is really much.
I hope there are many creations in my work as well as purity.
I'm balanced - it's my key to those big numbers.
I don't want to create a false life.
Where better to give people what they want, and to slow down what you want to do," says A. Jjaleavičitė.
One of the most difficult events of youth is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, a well-known human proposal over a lifetime of history: to talk about failures, failures, life-threatening events so that they remain authentic.
As such, A. Jagelevicítė proposes to apply to all cultures.
According to them, culture does not have its potential without any benefits, without any promotions and showing certain values.
"How does the teacher feel about the students - are there any chances?
If we do not find a certain way to deliver that message, make sure that you do not announce it.
When we're real and we're going to be a reader - maybe someone's gonna change.
I got one time, one second, one third - and I already belong," she shares her views.
Three people's dengues facing an explosive attack in Lithuania on the north coast of June
On Saturday after an explosion in the north of June, three people started searching in Alaska.
One man was saved after a five - day catastrophe, and the other three failed to find him.
The shipyard is located near the port of Lithuania, in the northwestern part of June.
It was found that it was Airbus H125 on the road to Grand Prijet Texas.
On the fifth day of the aircraft's landing, 100 feet from the shore have been found.
According to Associated Press, one survivor was 14 years old.
It was reported that she had mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
We'd lose two adults and two teenagers in the army.
According to KTVA, David King (53 m), Josh Pepperdas (42 m) and Andrew Pepperdas (11).
It has been established that Mr Pepperdas is the director of the Aliasko construction company "David Constructors & Engineers".
I don't know why the accident happened.
The National Transport Security Council requested that the investigation be initiated.
"I am going to put on a full-fledged firefight which has been completely new – only from the factory – two adults and two teenagers are running away," says the Coast Guard Officers' report on the basis of the CTVA.
It has been found that the pilot has had 40 years of experience flying fixed-wing aircraft and aircraft, including flights to Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeffa Brodsky said that close friends had “not yet lost hope of a miracle. ”
On 17 February 2016, the rescuers renewed their search for Alpines who had been hit by the tsunami in Fort Viljam, Scotland.
On Saturday, three people were searched in Alaska after an accident.
"I've experienced sexual violence"
President Kellyanne'a Conway's council revealed an experience of sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the economic dispute between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and his defendant, Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was pleased to discover that he himself had experienced sexual violence, and accused B. Kavanaugh of leading Jake Tapper, saying that the judge accused of sexual harassment by ignoring the negative facts of the charges.
"I am deeply impressed by the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I personally experienced sexual harassment," said Conway on the CNN Sunday "State of the Union".
"I'm a victim of sexual violence and I don't think that judge Kavanaugh's, Take's Tapperis, Jeffas Flake's or anyone else is responsible for it.
We must be responsible for our actions."
Conway said that the news network had to be led to a comparison of Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to three to ten years' imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania.
Conway also criticized the Senate's judicial committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who committed oral sex in his office and abused people in the United States.
The hearing showed that the events of Kavanaugh and Ford shared the US community
The Americans disagree on the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and Christine's Blasey Ford – the defendant claims that the judge sexually abused her when they were teenagers.
In the opinion that Ford or Kavanaugh is melancholy, 38 per cent of respondents say that Kavanaugh was in the process of giving evidence at the earliest or no doubt, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Committee of the Court of Justice heard a letter from Ford to Senator Dianne Feinstein, with detailed charges against the judge.
After writing a letter, Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak to the committee.
The evidence shows that Ford said there were 100 percent true that at the beginning of the 9th century, he tried to rob Kavanaugh of it, not another person.
In an emotional emotive language, a 51 - year - old woman said that she felt civil duty, so she could not hold back.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think my civil duty is to tell me what happened when Brittas Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women's allegations of sexual abuse have been rejected by Kavanaugh, who said that "no sexual intercourse in secondary school, college or ever later".
“All of you have tried to find something that would prevent you from voting for my appointment, no matter how unrealistic or unrealistic it is,” he said.
"It's just the last minute of the ice cream."
The results of a survey conducted on 27-28 September, under which 2607 people were interviewed, were not surprising: the various parties were divided by opinions: the Democrats were more likely to believe in Ford (73 per cent), and the Republicans (74 per cent), although the Ford showed more faith in republics than in Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The "Body Worlds" creator of the exhibition called "Daktar Death" wants to be interrupted and demonstrated in his own show
A German scientist wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition "Body Worlds".
Guntheris von Hagens developed a innovative method that allows for demonstration of lavender, canals and organs throughout the world in a worldwide flood of exhibitions, anticipation and excitement, and conflicting evaluations.
A 73 - year - old man with a deadly disease told people to plasticize him after his death so that he would become a permanent exhibit in the Body Worlds, which will be opened in London this week.
"It will in a certain sense end his life's work.
Now I understand that I will have to do it because I have expressed recognition and love," says Angelina Whalley to the newspaper The Observer.
She said that the man had given strict instructions on what to do with his lion, and the whole process would end for about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed and the body must be allowed into the body and built in the necessary position.
"He said to me, 'Angelina, it may freeze me to -25 degrees, but then you'll have to add your hand, or I'll break it."
So I'll be able to push for years, then I'll have to take it."
Then, in the most perfect case, by hiding from his image a soft fetish flight, he will join the show on the London deck next to other bodies, standing on standby positions, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagenss was shocked by a flight in the United Kingdom via direct British television (the first public flight over 170 years).
There have been over 47 million visitors from around the world since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, told the newspaper The Guardian that 100 percent of the demonstrations involving some 28,000 square feet were presented by the people who "sended the agreement because they wanted to help the living, shine them and help see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are going to die.
We will never escape it, death is common to us all, and I think that "body Worlds" shows that there is no need to fear," said Tabernalis.
Ronaldo's lawyers challenge the court's case for the conviction
The Portuguese football star, Christian Ronaldo, said on Friday that he would bring the German magazine, published by the American "exactly illegal" claims that Ronaldo was expelled in 2009.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertzas, said that the article "Der Spiegel" was "not accepted as a private debt statement" and he will, by legal means, be paid back to his client.
The statement was submitted to the Reuters agency by Ronaldo, a representative of Gestefute, in response to the request to comment on the five-day article “Der Spiegel” published on the Internet.
Gestefute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement which Reuters could not automatically verify.
Der Spiegel first published the charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo won five prizes in the best world.
This summer he moved to "Juventus" from "Real Madrid" to Italy; the Italian club refused to comment on "Der Spiegel".
The newspaper reported that the alleged expropriation took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in June 2009 – this was said by Kathryn's Mayorga lawyer Leslie Mark Stovals.
Stoval told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga did not agree with the court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronalde's 375 000 dollars.
Stovala immediately did not respond to Reuters e-mails about comments and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovallas told Der Spiegel that he filed a civil complaint in order to cancel a confidentiality contract.
The Mayorg newspaper Der Spiegel said that the contract did not end because it still feels the effects of the night before nine years ago.
"I survived a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘In addition, the charge is to avoid.
I'll blame him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business ensuring the independence of producers
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
In the new White Paper published by the Independent Creators Union today on the "#selfpub3.0" website, the first time was a detailed explanation of how to join other business makers, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The association of independent producers Orna Ross has already been recognized for the first time by one of the 100 most influential people, at the Digital Book World 2018 conference will explain why the authors should be allowed by Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
‘The trends in evaluation, e.g. popular personal brands, responsible use and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies, create very favourable conditions for business of manufacturers’,’ says Ross.
However, these options can only be used by independent and creative thinkers and by those who know their power who understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages the creation of a number of employment sources through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to work from direct sales, refurbishment models, collective assistance, wide dissemination models and other sources of income, e.g. online training and related entity activities.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in different formats to the widest audience using minors and other services.
The main purpose of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage change of mind and learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, would not be transferred without claim to another company, such as a specialised journal or a self-publication service provider.
According to Ross, manufacturers can thus increase their income, influence and impact and in these methods need to be concerned not only by every digital age creator but also by the publishers; it also stressed that true independence of producers (as well as other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
You're gonna come over here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
In the book Self-Publishing 1.0, computer literature and printing is described as required.
The theme of Self-Publishing 2.0 is to sell e-books for books and telephones in online bookstores.
The new Self-Publishing 3.0 era is now under way, where self-employed publishers will learn to start a forwarding and sustainable business.
The Union of independent creators is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers who are self-evident.
The aim of the Union is to develop the skills of self-employed publishers, promote ethical activity, help beginners sell books and encourage producers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
On the six-day basis of the population government plans to significantly increase the deficits next year, the Italian President and the Head of the Central Bank warned that the debt must be managed by the country.
The ruling parties (opposite movement of five stars and the right North Pole) presented a proposal for a deficit of 2019 on Thursday evening for a deficit of 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (BVP) and three times above the previous administrative objective.
This report on Friday made the market feel bad and encouraged the sale of bonds and gave rise to bank shares.
In addition, such plans do not conflict with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and maintains their compliance.
In calling on the auditor in the presidential Chambers mentioned in the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Matarella stated that under the country's basic laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt managed".
"So we will protect our citizens' savings," he said
In a recent central Italian conference, Italian bank president Ignazio Visco said that it is not possible to continue to increase country debt, which is the largest of the major economies of the European Union and seeks 131 per cent of GDP.
"It has to give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Viscoas, on the basis of the public knowledge agency Ansa.
"The debt must be reduced in a consistent manner."
The Head of the North Level and Vice-President of the Minister Matteo Salvinis responded to Matarella's words that the debt increased over the year by applying the strict requirements of Brussels.
"Remember me, Mr President," Salvinis said in his statement.
"The debt of the State has been exhausted for the year of European budgets, we are finally changing plans and we are looking for a better future and growth."
In the past, just before telling Matarella or Visco, the five-star movement leader Luigi Di Mayo said that earlier the money will be returned to people from the budget, but he added that the government does not intend to oppose EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pressured the Economic Minister Giovanna Tria to support their planned deficits.
The Italian press claimed that Matarella supported Tria's unsuccessful attempt to maintain a budget deficit which would not reach 2% of GDP.
The Presidents of the country and central bank shall not directly affect economic policy.
The 77-year-old President may withdraw the law and return it to Parliament but only once.
Parliament can then adopt and justify an unchanged law again.
Official information: The feelings of the Indonesian tsunami have lost a large bungalow
The Indonesian Geophysics Agency rejected the warning about tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then there was a severe earthquake following a massive earthquake towards the northeastern coast of the island of Sulaja, where hundreds of people were killed and thousands were left homeless.
Car rental by Cunami Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the earthquake and tsunami of 7,5 years, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the city of Palu in Jakarta, at least 384 people died.
The officials said that the number of victims was very high the next day.
On Friday, a crowd gathered at the festival at Palu in a flood, where a flood of stones swept many of the lost six - foot (18 feet).
The Geophysics Agency held the BMKG on Saturday in critical social media: many people wondered if the warning about tsunami had not been rejected in advance.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the nearest flood feeling of about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
‘We do not have surveillance data from Palu.
So we had to make a decision on the basis of the data we had," said Rakhmat Triyon, head of the BMKG earthquake and tsunami centre.
The nearest water level measuring the sea level was only found to be a six-centimetre [2.5-inch] wave and did not detect large waves near Palu.
‘If we had a pool of water at Pala or received data from it, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about this in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Palu and the surrounding areas at great speeds, hundreds of miles per hour, but I don’t know if it happened before or after the attack.
The inhabitants will check the lava in the street looking for their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of social media videos, we believe that the tsunamis took place before the official withdrawal of the warning," Triyono said.
The most damaging earthquake of 9.5 bacillus occurred on the second day of July 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed some 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126,000 victims in Indonesia.
The beautiful city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is located near the coastal coast of Slava Island in the northeastern part of the country.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the tsunamis devastated the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to researcher Baptiste Gomberto of Oxford University of Geophysics, the earthquake was not supposed to cause tsunami.
The five-day earthquake was caused by a horizontal fall – the rapid tectonic plane moved horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there was a drought in the sea, a great amount of water and a drought,” he said, adding that along the coastal coastal coast, the power of the waves could be concentrated in the dry riverbed.
Sutopo'as Purwo'as Nugroho's correspondent said that his team "will be ready to send easily understood public warnings" when the warning about the tsunami was lifted immediately.
According to the Ministry of Communication, the inhabitants had repeated notification of the text sent to them with warnings, but Nugroho said that the power lines and communications lines of the ground were interrupted and there were no sirens.
In the social media, the Indonesians doubted whether BMKG had to withdraw the warning about the tsunami and complained that the information had not been submitted in time.
"I'm late... Warning has been cancelled... And the tsunamis have still occurred..." – Twitter user @zanogucky sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood gift to buy ticket sales records
On Saturday, after winning fourth rounds, Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood became the first two Europeans to win all four-time matches, and will soon be recorded in the history, as Europe is already the first to be represented by 10:6 before the end of Ryder Tower.
After completing the Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau 5/4, they became the first European pair to win all four matches.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The shocking results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show nothing.
Three times he killed 14 important titles, Woods, and twice he won Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory against the Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, the US team this week, who won three other strikes.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five out of five possibilities on Sundays.
Fleetwood has already benefited most of the points of Ryder's steel in the units as a new European.
The pair that the Molywood industry will receive will not appear to be able to move the European team forward from the first sight.
From Ryder's tortoise, such as Fleetwood, no such display is believed to have occurred, and Molinaris did not succeed in any of the previous six games, and he broke up with four hostages.
However, it was also hoped that Fletwood was the first in Europe in the past year, known as Le Golf National as its five fingers, and here in 2017 he won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a strong temperature during this year "U.S. Open".
Molinaris is a new British Open Championship and is considered by many to be the most successful European tournament player – a useful feature in the first field, where the golden word can lead to failure, as the American failure has shown.
These games have become boring and harmonizing games in the field that made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little so sensitive and still on Saturday," Fleetwood said in a broadcast, playing with a wide smile all week.
This afternoon we had a great show, played stable and good.
If we meet together in history, this will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we worked on the team."
Molinars were also excited.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to carry out our duty, not just get into the record book, so we will have to fight hard tomorrow for 4.5 points that we need to win; it will not be easy."
Reterior anger!
Ireland’s neighbor in the mid-West War
The town of Claregalway in the west of Ireland was formerly powerful, a 15-year-old family’s main fortress from the British Ritier and was reminded of its origin this Saturday.
Two times during the mid-term combat festival at Claregalway in Golvaj, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A fully restored Anglo-Northian home with a well-pounded medium-sized field of combat, where many enthusiasmists from all over the world have recovered contact battles and games that were popular hundreds of years ago.
On the rite of rite, Karl Dornanas and his brother-in-law are patrolling Donna Dornan in the great city of Claregalway during the mid-morning battle festival in Golva, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
“It’s a great weekend and something unusual,” said Denise Fitzgerald from Kerio’s graffiti after the week’s family.
"This is how we go back to simple things.
I'm trying to do everything as necessary," said a theatre worker who participated for the first time in an armed struggle festival.
The forest was filled with genuine fighting fighters, and though their times were empty, some villages were weakened, and one was damaged by the tongue.
The bicycles demonstrated their skills by skating and squeezing their hips and shoulders.
The metal blades were used to carry guns, the enemy's buyers were ready for drugs, and the amate’s neck and neck were turned into wool.
Those involved in serious wrongdoing and in some cases have tried to get involved.
"I believe that anyone can wear a costume, but involvement in it is measurable," said Helena Stackpoole, playing by Eleanor Fitzgerald and having the unique opportunity to use his model design knowledge.
“All clothes are sent by hand.
I've been wearing my sword for two years now, and now I'm wearing my suit and I'm just wearing 800 pearls on her hands.
I care about it," she said.
The number of deaths after earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed on Sunday after earthquake and tsunami on the island of Slavonia in Indonesia increased to 832 and the affected area is greater than initially considered.
The agency's representative Sutopo'as Purwo'as Nugroho's news conference said that many people had been forced to flee after a 7.5-ball earthquake on Friday and a six-metre high tsunami strike (20 feet).
The FBI called on the second woman who called the candidate Kavanaugh
The FTB agents, investigating the Supreme Court of the United States of America's Bretto Kavanaugh case, called on a second woman, who was accused of having sex with him, which was the day after the divorce of this woman's lawyer.
Deborah's Ramirez's report by counsel John Clune states that the FTB's investigation into Kavanaugh's case will not include only individual charges against the trial which Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford presented to the Conservatory of the Federal Appeals Court this week at the dramatic Senate meeting.
Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of having shown her his penmanship on the night he was arrested and held at the University of Jeill when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donaldas Trumpas presented a series of press releases to the Senate and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after the fourth session of the Senate, at which Professor Ford of the University of California made detailed allegations that Kavanaugh tried to prevent it during the evening in 1982 when both of them were both at school and were young.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the Baltic Chambers limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
The crowd rejected this and announced the Twitter news: "I really want them to question all the people they need."
The representative of the White House Raja Shahas said that Senatas determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study must be completed weekly).
"Baltic rooms allow agents to do what they are learning," Shahas said.
United Kingdom after Brexito will not renounce environmental or animal protection standards
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not renounce environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexito, trade transactions can be made.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove's visit to Daunga Street, London, on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Conservative Party, Gove said that it would be useful for the United Kingdom to be informed about its quality food products and its government to publish a food strategy this year.
Europe restored Ryder's fat in units
Francesco's Molinaris won the prize on Sunday, returning the Ryder Tower to Europe: the Italians killed Phil Mickelson at a point of 16 donations and work, helping to achieve the required 14.5 results.
Mickelson gave the first ball into the water, and when he was able to stay in the threshing floor, Molinaris became the first European, winning all five games a week, although not one of the previous six was injured.
The European victory has already been ensured that the Italians launched a strike from the start of the field and to the ground defeat one point, while Henrikas Stanson and Sergio Garcia were the first match and was secured at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day they had first score 10:6 and had to gain four and a half points from the possible 12, so that they could restore the trophies and establish their accommodation in the homes that had ended since 1993.
Only two times before this, the teams managed to eliminate the difference between the four points and to win unit strikes: this was done by the U.S. team in the 1999 "Medinos Watch" series in Brooklyn and Europe 2012, but no one was able to find another shocking return.
Justin Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony's Finau gave teammates Jim Furyko the hope of winning the first match, but then the European team points were expanded in all detail.
Thorbjornas Olesena disturbed Jordan Spietha, and his teammate, new friend Jonas Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles were lost four times in four.
The best player known by Ryder was Ianas Poulteris, who won most of the ovaries this week, when the best world player Dustin Johnson released him in 18th grade and joined Europe to win.
Then he had to guess who the game would end first, and this was the Molinary game, which caused a happy bang in the mini, which was the biggest in the event story.
RT World News: German police protecting Erdogan used the name of Neonacio as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in East Germany, keeping Turkish President Erdogan in custody this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a bitterly respected non-onatic extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region said that the Sakson State Criminal Police in East Germany were investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist SEK.
Men were directed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan during his long-term journey to Germany.
The officials had to work secrets and therefore had to use the code name under the Protocol.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt – a deeply respected non-onacated non-affiliated group of extremists of the National Socialist Foundation (NSU) that killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer at the beginning of this year.
The local media reported that the amended code name was known when two police officers requested permission to obtain internal documents necessary to carry out their tasks.
The Chief of Staff immediately withdrew from the police.
The head of the Saxon criminal police, Petricas Kleine's first reaction to the news.
He said that the decision to use the name Boehnhardt was "probably the most convenient" and thus "the apparently ignored victims and their closets".
Minister of the Interior of Saxony Roland Wolleris endorsed this statement and called the decision "fashioned, scared and totally unacceptable".
The visit of Erdogan on Friday in Berlin led to many conflicting assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for accepting the leader charged with growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, "but when there are no agreements, they need to be resolved in person".
For the first time, the public heard about the UN in 2011 when Boehnhardt and his brother Uwe's Mundlos' body were found in the east of Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed another and then killed after an unsuccessful attempt to expand the bank in Eizenacho.
A third member of the neo-Nazi group was soon arrested and the last life left Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 counts.
She refused to participate in the murder, but her lawyer said that the defendant felt a moral debt because he did not try to stop the killers.
Following the UNS scandal, the German security agency received a lot of criticism.
Judges, activists, and victims believe that the group had much more members.
It has also been shown that the German Internal Oversight Agency BfV has infiltrated many informants into the NSU and has always prevented the investigation of killings, killings and seizures associated with the group.
Musket comes out of Tesla's manager's duties and will have to pay $20 million fines to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gave him a hand in the case of Twitter fraud, in which he claimed to have made Tesla a private undertaking.
Musks will have to be removed from the manager's duties, but will remain the Director-General.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muska must be removed from the duties of the President of the Tesla Council and shall be prohibited from returning to these duties within 45 days.
And he'll have to pay $20 million for it.
All started with the news on Twitter, which was indiscriminately or inaccurately written, so Muska will have to get confirmation before anything is said or announced about Tesla "any format, including, but not limited to, social media (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company’s website), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because Musko's initial Twitter knowledge has not been checked.
On 7 August, Muskas was charged with fraud against investors on Twitter, where he claimed that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company worth $420, which one share would cost more than 10 per cent of the company's securities.
Muska soon took his words by saying that Tesla would remain public and attracted investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided that Musko’s original statement “was unfair and misleading because it did not support the facts”.
In his online journal, Muska himself explained that this error could be justified: after a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Arabia independent asset fund, he was impressed that he was able to agree on the basis of funds.
It is reported that the Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission had joined the lower court – Musku would have to reject the president's position for only two years and should not have to acknowledge the debt, but Muskas rejected this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday the price of Tesla's securities declined, and as soon as it changed its opinion, it agreed with more stringent conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, as in the past, Musku does not need to recognise the accused of misleading investors.
Aleksandrias patriarchachas committed to support the canon of Ukraine's church and called for orthodox unity
Aleksandria's patriarcha Theodora II appealed on the basis of the canon of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to Moscow's patriarchate.
He said in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Constantinople patriarchate.
On Thursday, Theodorus arrived in the city of Odes in the south of Ukraine and met with senior church representatives and religious orthodox.
Aleksandria patriarchas is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchys, which is due only to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
“I came to tell you: don’t abandon Orthodox faith and canon churches,” said patriarch Theodore II.
Before his visit to Odes, he met with the Polish Orthodox metropolis Savva, who also supported the canon of Ukraine.
It also called for the prevention of conflicts caused by attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," promised Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently survived a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople patriarchate to recognize the independence of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.
The last belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church, also called the patriarchate of Moscow.
Constantinepolis decided to send exarchus to Kiev, thus violating the rule banning the movement of one Orthodox church to other matters.
Egzarchai are special representatives of patriorcho, which formally employs a higher position than the Metropolis Onunfrey, which is now the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow patriot.
Maskovo's patriarchate responded positively to the actions of Constantinople and withdrew all the general prayers of the church and members of the organizations which were led or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that Constantinople had been warned not to take other forms of opposition and that both churches were not considered to be completely out of line.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one is recognized as the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the patriarchate of Moscow.
The majority of Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Orthodox Church belonging to the Kyev patriarchate, which was established in the 10th century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Philaret, who seeks the recognition of the official Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with Moscow patriarchate.
For the first time in three years, Damascus opened the major Syrian-Jordan trade crossing
According to the SANA State News Agency, the Syrian Government has claimed to open up a border crossing with the Nazi border crossing Jordan, which has been closed for three years due to war operations in this territory.
This can be done because the combatants spread land on the Syrian side to the city of Dara.
It is the most important trade union between the neighbouring countries, but also between the Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Most important thoughts from Lavro's UN language
On his visit to the United Nations Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovas seized the West on "political and brutal force" and said that diplomacy must not give dictatorships and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday, at the UN General Assembly, the Minister said that some Western countries, trying to maintain "the very position of the world's leaders themselves", do not pressure others.
He did not mention specific countries, but he said that they use "political stress, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for selfish ambitions in the small group of countries.
Lavrova, a ten-year representative of Russia to the United Nations, said at the meeting that diplomatic and negotiating culture changes the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without UN approval.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied in many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and the basic US blockade applied to Cuba for many years.
"But the story didn't teach us anything," Lavrov said and added that "The warlords are willing to carry the debt only if it's "very likely".
We remember how often such unjustified charges have been justified by rape and war, such as the explosions in Yugoslavia in 1999, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the invasion of Libya in 2011.
Of course, Lavrovs did not mention all Western invasions and the first of Syria’s seven - year war as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to convert the Damascus regime could have been detrimental to the whole country and opened up opportunities to protect the ‘terrorist caliphate’.
Lavrova has stepped up the Astana peace process launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said that this process has helped to prevent the Islamic State (IS, previously called ISIS) and other groups wishing to invade Syria as a whole.
It is most important now to restore the war zone and to help refugees safely return home.
Lavrova returned to the struggle with great powers and said that the United Nations has actually created "the second world war."
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia pointed out that, in 2018, it was concluded 80 years after the München Treaty signed in 1938, which France and Great Britain agreed to allow the nations to renounce the German-born part of Czechoslovakia in order to harm Hitler.
Although that year's British Prime Minister Neville's Chamberlain said that the München Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
"Miunchen's release" shows how "the country's selfishness and disregard for international law can continue to disappear," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship of the colonial era and the obligation must be to contribute to the archives of history or to the text."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the world's problems, Lavrov said.
"If you have any questions or objections, sit down and talk, disclose the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile the interests."
Are we going to celebrate Christmas?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapon has been shot in the head, and Bibi's hand is burning in Iran
The President of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Israel, stated that Tehran has a secret nuclear weapon.
The other Israelites may have been hiding something from the One who had told them about it.
Israel's beloved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released news on Thursday – a high-photoed picture of places where Iran is supposedly considered to be nuclear material.
Tehran recently replied that Tel Avivas should be concerned about its "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel has never acknowledged (but has not refused) the possession of nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdievas tried to find out whether Tel Avivas should actually seek refuge in his eyes.
Scotland's government: no complaints about Alexo Salmondo before January
The Scottish Government stated that by January of this year, no complaints were filed against Alexo Salmondo.
The former prime minister was accused of sexual harassment in January of two charges, although he strongly denied them.
In March, he was informed of the investigation.
As a result of the action taken by the Scottish National Party, the Government of Scotland has been indicted against it.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Government of Scotland stressed that no complaints were resolved by January.
A representative of the government of Scotland said: “The government of Scotland heard two complaints about Alexo Salmondo in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Earlier that year, the deputy prime minister did not raise any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the first minister first heard about a study from Alexo Salmando in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes, and we will strongly dispute our position.
The Scottish Government will try to obtain as much information as possible.
However, as we have already said, we cannot comment now on the legal reasons of Mr. Salmondo's case."
“ We have nothing to say, ” said Alexo Salmondo, “because our request to the permanent secretary is now under review at the court hearing and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
"Dragons" score 29:13: "Warriers" player Lee Jones's question
Glazgas restored the winner's title in the Guinness Pro14 league by winning additional points and defeating Dragons Scottstown stadium, and coach Dave's Rennie doesn't hide satisfaction, but I think the game could have been more accurate.
After the unexpected loss of Southern Kings Commands Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie was asked by a very much changed team to reach and although she was able to collect the necessary points so that she could remain at the A conference, the windy and suitable air was not really smooth.
"I think we're good at fighting tonight, we're playing on the right side of the field and our strategy was good," said Rennie.
"We had to play more precisely and we could use more opportunities.
The conditions were unacceptable.
We have created many opportunities and are happy to do so.
It is necessary to play more precisely, but the 40 or 50 winning points today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won additional points, but next week we have to make more effort by playing home with Zebre and another week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the air was frozen, the Glazgo team had already begun to gain points, but the TMO had completed all the lost Huwo Jones coins, including his late internal transfer from Niko Matawalu to the western camp.
The delay did not last long: the left column of Olis Kebble's took the fourth minute in the middle, and Adamas Hastings easily finished the year.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwell Robson received the sentence, and the security stole another player from immediately after 20 minutes of mark and won the score.
The first half of the rounds just after the first half of the armament escaped almost half an hour's notice: Glass sides consistently sided the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa's University of Berry sentenced the wearers for 22 minutes for the protection of the ring on the Hastings side.
"Warriers" were allowed into the basements, but lost the canal after a short transfer, because some of the sharp left side of Matawal was unable to control the canal and it was transferred to the left.
The second test took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings invented the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball away to Lee Jones.
The camouflage was returned to Hastings in his position and the result for the hostages was 12:6.
The first minute of the second half of Glazgu was very successful: Alexo Dunbaro took the second test by Lee Jones, and Hastings helped him.
However, the Warriers failed after the failure – only four minutes later they took the ball in the middle of the field and the Dragons centre Adam Warren lost it after the doors, thus benefiting from the points, and later Joshua Lewis took it after the opening game with Robson.
The Warriers quickly returned to the leading position and 54 minutes after the fourth test profit added points when Huwas Jones moved to the right and Hastings was unable to transfer the ball (this was the third failure of the four trials).
Glazgas maintained a comfortable higher position and carried out a fifth test in a few minutes – Dunbaras transferred the ball to the ground with George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble was published by the best game player, but Rennie was married to Hastings.
"These obviously prevented us from playing, but we were right in the middle," said the coach.
“He had a few yards away, but it was cold and he was still able to walk away.
He's a good shape and trust himself."
"Air United" killed Morton's result 1:5: Air's family team of five stars
Lawrence's Shanckland and Craig Moore's won two prizes, and Declan McDaidas added another one and thus helped Air to remain on the top of the championship table.
"Air" went forward after Shankland's defeat, the invasion of six gardens after Michael Rose's campaign to McDaid.
Morton compared the 35th minute of the first test to the result when Charlie Telferes took the ball from Robbie Crawford's own square and sent it to the lower corner of his own country by the name of Rosa Doohan.
Players from the fourth quarter of the second quarter of the season had the chance to get out in front of Doohanas when Gary hit Oliver, but Michael Tidseras started a weak sentence that the owner had easily won.
The 74th minute of Ayr was a second time lost when the transfer of Craig McGuffie's long distance was delayed and landed on the ground was sent to the gates by another substitute player Craig Moore.
Moore's handed over that same minute to Shankland, who won 17 prizes this season.
As the chiefs arrived, Moore returned to his own half from the square country, and McDaida sent an open bag into the gates.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" finish result 0:2: first victory in league
"I am excited, I feel relieved, I am happy," Ray McKinnon exclaimed after the very necessary first Falkirk victory in the league and the winning season points.
"Rangers" hired by Zakas Rudden (18 years old) took advantage of the arrival in both camps and drove the family team "Alloa Athletic" into the championship button and released the club from the stresses.
"It was an important game for us," McKinnon acknowledged.
“After the last three rounds we probably won more than we won, so it was very good to win three points in the tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
This would not be a source, but it was important for us to succeed."
Rudden sent Patrick Brough a 26-minute bag and won the purchase from the middle of the door line when Deimanta Petravičius slowly pushed the bag over the owner Neil Parry.
"We wanted to stand firm but didn't succeed," admitted Mr. James Goodwins, director of the Wasps.
Hearts cell petition for semi-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
The Hearts series petition for Betfred was signed by more than 11,000 people in the semi-finals schedule.
The surgeons are ashamed of the decision to draw up two semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
In the past week, the Scottish police, SPFL, decided to hold the Aberdeen-Rangers openings at 12:00 p.m. and Hearts-Celtic at 19:45 p.m., as well as the “Jambos” and “Dons” series.
The Evening News, together with the Aberdeen Evening Express, requested a fair solution.
The so-called "Sixth Day" decision also called "Aberdeen" and "Hearts": both clubs published statements that criticise the agenda.
On Thursday, the website changed.org published an application which requires one of the waiters to move to another location or date.
A man is accused of being married to two women in the county of Kent
Two women who were present died in the crime scene.
According to the police representative, another man, also overcrowded at the age of 70, has been admitted to the hospital and has a stable condition.
The 28-year-old living on the same street remains arrested and will be sentenced on the first day for two killings and one murder at a meeting of the District Court where he participates in the video.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but I think they knew the suspect.
The family claimed that they were shocked by this event in the village, which they said was “very nice and friendly. ”
31-year-old Sophie Moorey-Brown said: "We live here for five years and we've never heard of any bad events – here is always a long and love to live."
Kings' archives and the music "Hamilton" created a world of light about King George III
When the King was presented with a project opened by the great document archive of the year of the reign of Journey III, it was believed that letters, journals and languages would help the public to get to know more about the Kings of the imagination.
Now these documents will reach another audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with the Vestend music.
Academics who wanted to reveal the king’s true face invited a musician named Hamilton III to review the most important documents from the king’s pro proposene rule.
Investigators are trying to make old papers available to a wider audience, so they will be able to obtain digital documents.
The members of the royal family have already publicly accepted the creation of music, and Saxo's hercoga and hercology are seen twice, although Prince Hario's opponent is always shown in the scene.
The Vestenda King Michael Jibson said that the documents had to be devised and helped to learn about the kings whose image was formed by the music "Hamilton", the film "Kariaus Jurgio" and the series "Siaubing's History".
"We've been thinking about beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Trumpas did not resolve enthusiasm after attempting to reduce pressure with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unu, and on Saturday at his supporters' meeting, he said that after the signing of the letters, he "sympathized".
Mr. Trumpas and Mr. Kimas said that they had discussed this at an unprecedented meeting held in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new stage of history after many years of public agreement, the leaders of the countries changed with horrors and abuses because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We were always upset," said Mr. Trumpas at a meeting in West Virginia.
“And then we thought, understood?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavicius and Panathinakis entered the Greek tomb at the end of the
The Greek poet of the Athenians "Panathinakis" celebrated the victory without any greater effort by Luke Lekavitia.
The Athenians command went out with the result 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) defeated the Patrios "Prometheus" team.
In the area of Lithuania, 14 minutes were spent, 4 taps (2/2 d.), one pack was recovered and one result was transferred and twice started.
As a result, Nick Calathes was awarded 15 points in the Panathinakis race.
Skuvernel's neighborhood to Shimonyte: decided everything by the party "Greet"
Prime Minister Saulus Skvernelis said that there was no democracy in the internal elections of conservators, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingrid Simonyt as president.
"The very "democratic" celebration was always a change when the Greek party decided and actively supported one candidate.
There may have been no other candidate's chance of winning even theorem," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government.
"Conservatives appointed their candidate, with that and we welcome them," added the prime minister.
The Prime Minister of the "Greens of the States" said that I. Shimonyt should be evaluated by voters who remembered her work in the Government of the Andriaus Kubliaas.
Mr Skvernelis has not commented on whether he himself is involved in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian States and the Green Union intend to approve their candidate next year.
Leader of the ruling "States" Ramūnas Karbauskis called the Conservatives' elections "unconstitutional experiment" because of the activity of the Menko parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has not been absolutely successful.
Only 55 per cent of the members of the party participated, of which only about 20,000 voters were in total.
Knowing what money was required to be issued for these elections, this is clearly one that did not fit in," said R. Karbauskis to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I thought something was wrong because the result was no, the party decided that their candidate was all right, but who would release both money," he added.
During the internal elections, 79% of the Conservatives and their supporters voted for the I. Shimonyts candidate during the week.
Lithuanian wages are funny: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey survey conducted this year, the wage of the Baltic countries is mostly growing in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have had little experience in their neighborhood, reports the company’s press report.
"Reviewed by 850 companies and the sharp change in pay in the Baltic countries, we see that the monthly pay before taxes this year increased 81.8 per cent of the workers and averaged 7.7 per cent and the annual pay with contributions was 10.5 per cent.
Latvia's unmarked environment - the amount of more than one kilogram of annual earnings here, but as in Estonia, the number of workers is lower than in our country," says Paul Blusius, a representative of the company organizing the survey of remuneration and adds that in the context of these employment trends, it should also be taken into account in the economic indicators of the country that are dictating them.
Estonia's employment pay as soon as possible
Although wages in Latvia and Estonia were lower than in Lithuania, growth was higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage for jobs rose by 71% of the employees of the companies interviewed and reached a maximum of 11 per cent in our country.
In Estonia, 73 per cent of the workers were paid this year and an average increase of 13 per cent.
Remuneration trends also have a major impact on the change in employees as shifts can receive much higher wages than in the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed jobs in Lithuania in recent years, annual wages have increased by 8.8 per cent - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In Latvia, the annual wage growth for such workers increased by 3.6 per cent, respectively.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries not only as an average of the most paid salary for new workers but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change their jobs or their duties, the wage was the fastest: monthly - 6 per cent, year by year, including contributions - even 9 per cent.
According to the payee, such trends often depend on or go beyond the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy governing market conditions.
For example, forecasting for the next economic year encourages business to behave more prudently and less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technologies, buildings, pharmaceuticals, can also create general statistics and make smaller changes.
Maximum tax burden for Latvians
It is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries in comparison with the increase in remuneration.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the taxes - even 31 or 34%, which can increase more employees up to 42.4%.
There is a constant 24% rate in Lithuania, so while there is a higher rate of remuneration in Latvia, workers can expect even less combined growth than in Lithuania.
Estonia has a tax rate similar to that in Lithuania - 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the best labour tax in the Baltic countries.
In IT - Competitively Competitive Remuneration
According to the study, in all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of responsibility, the position of IT specialists remains among the best payments.
The opposite situation in retail trade - market indexes in this area are one of the least, so employees work less than the market average income.
As in previous years, wages are paid at the earliest rate to plant engineers who take higher positions, as well as to risk management professionals.
The increase in such remuneration has not been observed this year, and some IT positions have increased by up to 14 per cent to a small proportion of the monthly wages paid by the organisation's information security specialists.
In the meantime, the pay for work in the retail trade has not changed much.
However, some companies have successfully achieved solutions to remuneration systems, so they have an annual salary of about 2 per cent for premiums.
According to pay professionals, the trend is noted that the growth in pay increases and the needs of the most demanding specialists - further demand for system analysts in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande is suffering again: the past promise doesn't end
After the separation with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson suffers from his pain by creating wounds for his relationship.
During the "Saturday Night Live" he chose to call on how quickly half to serious relationships.
The mayor said that the truth was that, just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete had withdrawn their promises, which happened only after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create scenarios where he didn't have any relationships, but it's going to happen in the screens a little later.
It is a shame that a humourist is hurting Arian himself because of his former relationships.
Such wounds are painful and not heartbreaking.
At least so far, TMZ has told the secret sources to the foreign news portal.
White or red: Which diet is recommended
White or red?
Which sugars are you going to pick?
In the course of the investigation, it has become evident that while Lithuanians still traditionally collect white sugar, the fact that many peoples reject this white death from the origined ingredient remains.
In addition to the fact that the sales of sugar did not increase, trade networks are also being kept secret.
According to Maximo's representative, red sugar is becoming ever more popular and popularly buys it more, although normal white sugars - according to the choice, it is still becoming more popular.
Plant and organic sugar sales in plant and specialised organic products shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to the Diotios Vaitkevičitės, the main difference is price, and the adverse effects on health may be both.
"The raw sugar that is not refined is three times more expensive, but in health terms these sugars increase them by using their surplus are harmful to the body," said Dr. Vaitkevicītė.
To live without diabetes, a diet is recommended to reduce its daily levels after a short period.
This will be done - for the benefit of all kinds of people - and unwanted kilograms, improvements and health.
If sugar is used less consistently during the month, it will be easier to refuse.
"Every idea we form within about a month's time, so when we perform such an experiment, let's say, a month is going to improve some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we'll see how positive it will be and I think we can all give up a bit of effort," said the ideologist.
Doctors claim that sugar white blood cell death is caused by diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It would therefore be worth trying to consume at least, but it is possible that this product is added to many food products, even to the data.
Another "Lietkabelio" step: Lipkevičen borrows other LKL teams
The team of the Panjevjes "Lietkabelio" met with Vyten Lipkeviči - the crew of the Prijeno "Skycop" team.
In this season "Betsafe-LKL" V.Lpkevičius introduced 6,4 points, restored 2,8 balls, delivered 2 results and collected 8,5 useful balls.
FIBA Championships in 29 years' league reached 3.8 points, 2.5 points, 1.5 results and 4.8 benefits in 21 minutes of playing.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will announce a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
S. Bushkevicas joined the train station
The team of the Lietkabeli of Panama became well-known as the assistant of the chief coach Nenado Čanako, Sandis Buškevicas.
In the period 2005-2006, 41-year-old Latvian played Vilnius "Lietuvos" and worked on this club's 2014-2017 system as a coach assistant.
In the last season, S. Buškevicas trained Jäkabpil "Jekabpils" team.
The sports director, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stepon Babrausk to the station, but he still intends to continue his career.
The invitation was also extended to White Jasikević, but the agreement failed both sides.
S. Buškevicas "Lietkabeli" train station will work with Robert Kuncaichi and Algimanta Bruž.
On Tuesday, Latvis will join Lietkabelio and will be "Cido" in the arena via FIBA Championship level match with Dixon JDA, but on the ground we will not be able to grow because the registration was completed for the last 24 hours before the start of the race.
The reduction of biofuel prices will not be acceptable for all
In order to reduce the biofuel price, more leaves will be added in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister for Environment.
According to Kästuchi Navicko, this is how you want to "impact" the biofuel price.
"We have a great deal of confusion about certain types.
We need to balance....
The focus on the soft leaves is because we can also influence the biofuel prices," said Seime on Tuesday, presenting the situation of deforestation.
According to Navicko, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by around 20%.
According to the Minister, the next year the sides will be broken as much as this year, and the angles will be about 50 acres [80 ha] below.
According to him, in Lithuania wood is more produced by favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be another year," said Mr. Navick.
Now 10,2 million ha forests are state and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fight against food prices - a questionable obligation: encouraging only to buy your own area
Among the measures submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture, the proposed reduction in prices is an obligation for public institutions and organisations to purchase 50% of food from local producers, a new portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could be provided to the purchaser in the municipalities and tenders by local companies who have won," said Minister of Economic Affairs Virginia Sinkevicius.
The President of the meat processing association Egidiius Mockevićius is not in doubt that this provision would discriminate against businessmen, and it would be difficult to control whether the law is being used by the bakers.
The measure on non-compliance is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation, Mr Sutkus.
Macronas calls for Europe to protect from Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macronas invited Tuesday to create a "real European army" with opportunities to protect Russia and even the United States
E. Macronas, from his entry into power calling for the creation of a common European Union power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
It has recently received an important argument that US President Donald Trumpu will announce that Washington will withdraw from an important Cold War Treaty on nuclear power.
"We have to wake up from China, Russia and even the United States," said E. Macronas to the radio "Europe".
This is the first interview given to his radio since the beginning of May 2017 at the post of the Labour President.
"When I see how President Trumpas announces that he is withdrawing from an important settlement agreement created after the 9th century European missile crisis, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned rocket crisis has led to a non-strategic nuclear-weapon development chain which has been launched by the United States in Europe by the end of the Cold War.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude a Middle East Nuclear Powers Agreement (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," said E. Macronas, interviewed on Monday evening in Verden in the north-eastern France, to the President this week on his visit to our place in World War I before the end of this conflict 100 years.
According to E. Macrono, in the situation, "when Russia, which is at our borders, has shown that it can be a threat... we need a Europe that is better at its own disposal, not just dependent on the United States."
The French leadership has become the main initiative, moving the project to build up the capacity of nine European countries to quickly organize a common military operation, evacuation from the war zone or to provide assistance in the event of natural disasters.
The Minister of Defence of these nine States will meet on Wednesday for the first time in Paris to discuss details on how this power will work.
The European Union has also been committed to a significant increase in its defence budget since 2021 and for research and new technical development of around EUR 13 billion over the next seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not reach EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras of the French War Schools, who was preparing high-ranking military personnel, said that the vision of Mr. Macrono on a closely linked European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of building a common strategy culture is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- There is, however, a great gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macronas celebrates, and the fact is that there are very large differences between European partners."
Lukaschenka NATO based on rockets: we're not idiots
On Tuesday, Belarus President Aleksandra Lukaschenka said that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to be able to reach the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to serve as a prisoner, disbanded in Poland or otherwise, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially rockets," says A. Lukašenko, a group of American analysts meeting in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already owns its rocket manufacturing industry.
"In the last few years - you have noticed and we have not hidden - we have created our rocket industry and produced our own very precise (appropriate) rocket weapons," the President stressed.
Last week, A. Lukaschenka said that Minsk and Moscow were looking for a proper and unbeatable response to plans to build a base in Poland and to call it the honor of U.S. President Donaldo Trumpo (Donaldo Trappo) for the "Trumpo Fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, this makes us nervous.
If, of course, in Poland, they claim they are ready to issue millions of dollars to dislodge some Trumpo fortress, of course we are not idiots and of course we are reacting to it," said A. Lukašenka, attending the Main Group of the München Security Conference in Minsk.
"Suddenly, with our main Union (Russia) we are considering how to answer all of this and how to find a suitable response at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow markedly revealed the Krishma anecdotes of Russia in 2014.
Their links also contributed to Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and to the fight this year in Great Britain, it is believed that an attempt by the Russian Special Services to eradicate the former double agent of the Serbian Scriptures has been carried out by a paralysing substance.
The attack between Moscow and Washington will further expose Mr. Trumppa to his plan to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this could undermine the global security system.
A man who committed a recent execution revealed how he had killed his man who had been beaten by a football player
Brazil was subjected to a blood crime during which the country's footballer Daniel Correa Freitasus was subjected to a brutal execution.
The athlete was killed at the 18-year-old girl's birthday party.
The 24-year-old football player found no live in the city of Paranos, in the Brazilian countryside.

After a bloodthirsty murder, Brazil later described in detail what happened on the night of the tragedy.
"The evening had already received a warrant when I realized that I had never seen my wife a Christian for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I couldn't wait to get out of the door, and I saw Daniel and my man lying in bed crying for help.
I was going to die.
Along with my former friends in the evening, we threw him into the field and buried him in the car.
Here I had a friend with whom I had tormented my husband for years.
I was very nice, I couldn't do anything about it," said the killer.
Along with his friends, he threw out a dead football team at the river where police officers were looking for a major blood crime tool.
The Brazilian civilian police detained E.B. Junior as well as his own and his birthday saint.
It is claimed that the police officers investigating the incident still have strong evidence that women were detained during the evening.
True, the latest information and photos of footballer's latest release in the watch app can help the research team.
The footballer sent two photos to one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he managed to get himself into the room, a woman sleeping next to her, who, as it later appeared, is a Jewish wife, Cristina.
"I want to stay here.
There are many women living in different rooms.
I'll eat the mother of the cook, even though her father is somewhere near," the footballer wrote to his boyfriend.
Daniel Corre Freitas, a member of the "Sao Paulo" club, was awarded a second loan for the "Sao Bento" winning in the Brazilian league in this season.

Alam ‘Hurts’ may not be used for suspension
Alabama's private player Jalena Hurtsa will not be able to stop this season after this Saturday.
Hortsas is included in the 6th day of the Crimson Tide, which has the highest rating in front of the much weaker Louisiana team, and this is the fifth player's tournament for this season.
This year the NCAA has adopted a new rule – a possible suspension of the player involved in the four games.
This month, Athletic reported that Horts planned to do this because of the opponent's evaluations and the team trainer's staff's response to them.
At the beginning of the season Tua'as Tagovailoa changed Hurts, but trainer Nick Sabanas said he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
During the last season, Hurtsas helped Alabama to enter the national championship title for Georgia's team, but the second half of it was changed by Tagovailoa, which contributed to the Crimson Tide victory result 26:23.
The former party of the Peter's conference year, Hortsa, started the last 28 albums and set off the season with record results: 26:2.
The first four episodes of the Crimson Tide ended on Saturday, left 276 yards, spent four times profiting points, and took the ball once.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Disaster must immediately sign the contract
The former Dalas "Cowboys" party, Dezas Bryant, said that it was soon back to NFL.
Mr. Terrell Owens, a member of the Slovenian museum, said that I should be quick to help Bryant.
In response to a question posed by Twitter, when it was intended to sign a contract with the team, Bryant published on Friday a statement known as "Twitter" on one word: "Recently."
The three times selected for Pro Bowl's call don't depend on any team since Dalas Cowboys refused to fight for compensation in mid-April.
Bryant, who may have rejected the contract with the Baltimore Ravens, and who has always been linked to Cleveland Browns before the same season, said that he wanted to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In June, after Owens' arrival at the professional American football club, while still talking about returning to NFL, the TMZ site said that Brittas should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"He has to join the team and prove everything he can," Owens said to the website.
“All viewers think that he is not as good as he thinks he is.
Now he has to go to the team for any reward, to accept a contract of one or two years – that is absolutely irrelevant – and to show everyone what he can do."
In 2017, within the Dalaso team, Brittany won a total of 69 prizes, 838 yards, and six winning points.
At the age of 29, the player lost 100 yards in his career - 23 yards.
After signing a $70 million contract for five years in 2015, Brittany lost no more than one season of 1000 yards and won no more than eight points of profit.
“If the Director-General or the owner thinks your skills are being lost, you will not be able to recover or collect any amount you want,” Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryant would have to get to the team as soon as possible, because later this could not be achieved and he said that it would be possible to return to the "Cowboys" living in difficult times.
"Of course, I don't know if their relationship isn't going to end," Owens said, who won 38 times the score by playing three seasons in Dallas' team.
"I think that Dezo's case, if Chowboys takes it back and he gets a chance, will be useful to Desu and French."
Consultation on the establishment of the CERN Centre for Business Development in Lithuania
Last week, representatives of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CEERN), which was published last week, will assess the possibility of establishing a CERN Centre for Business Development in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where companies receive assistance in commercialising CERN technologies, in the development of innovative products and in the application of social needs.
Although Lithuania has only recently become a member of the CERN, the establishment of an Incubator in the country has already been delayed since then.
The CERN representatives of Kaune visited the University of Health of Lithuania (LSMU) and the University of Kauna Technology (KTU) at the Santakos Institute for Material Science and Biomedical Engineering.
At the meeting at the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC), guests with KTU, LSMU, the University of Vytautato, the Institute of Energy of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Economics and Business discussed the Kauna innovation ecosystem and opportunities for innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Centre for Business Development is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on regional scientists and business innovations.
"This would encourage the adaptation of CERN knowledge and technologies to key problems, such as new technologies and working intelligence, to be used for disease diagnostics and treatment, for the processing of large data," said Dr. Leonas Balashević, KTU Science and Innovation Projector.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide business development assistance - provide information and expert advice through technology in product creation and assists in the search for funding sources.
The only assignment is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre is composed of experts in various areas: information technology, material engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The organization CERN is best known for its high-end LHC, The Large Hadron Collider.
However, CERN is carried out not only in quantitative mechanics but also in other areas, from chroogenic (very cold-mixed temperatures) to partial monitoring and radiation studies.
The work of these technologies and scientists has an impact on many important areas of society: medicine, safety and industrial development.
"Vilnia's fingertip" has a new leader
The new Director-General, AB "Vilniaus dentika", has appointed Mr Mitzus, who will replace Raymond Pilka in these duties.
For the past two years, Mr Filká has continued to be responsible for the financial director of the "Vilnia Degett" fund, as stated in the report published by the "Nasdaq" Vilnius Exchange.
Mr. Mituzas is the co-founder of the company Buga LT, mentioned in its heading "LinkedIn".
In 2012-2017, Mituzas was responsible for the regional director of the SPI Group, who previously worked in the Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.

During the period considered, the company employed EUR 392,300 profits.
The company’s non-accession income amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared with the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people work in the "Vilnius dent".
STT maintained R. Ača - Business know-how
The former Parliamentary and former Director of the Administration of the municipality of the Rasei Region of Remigius Achas is suspected of inhaling.
He's in custody.
The Special Research Service (STT) reports that the officials of the Šiauliai Council are conducting a preliminary investigation on possible corruption committed in the municipality of the Rasei region.
"The former Director of the Municipal Administration of the Rasei Region, R. A. (Remigius Achas - red. mail) is suspected of poisoning.
In terms of the circumstances under which public procurement was not conducted correctly, R.A., in the context of the duties of the Director of the municipality, it is possible for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with the municipality of Rasei region.
It is estimated that R.A. has taken a large amount of fat (more than 250 MGL) for this," writes the STT report.
The BNS adds that this company is the "Rase Bus Park".
On Monday officials also suffered corruption by Vladislov Šimaiti, the head of the company run by the Rasei municipality "Rasei bus park".
This BNS confirmed the STT representative of the print company Renata.
The STT report states that the objections are also expressed to two representatives of companies who bought Mr. Ača directly or participated in the masking of the various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, at their workplaces and at their homes.
Suspension of increase in LSDD
After supporting Ajas, who was the head of the administration of the municipality of the Region of the Rasei Region, but had failed to fulfil those duties without the support of the Council's reports.
He was also a member of this region in 2011-2012 Mr. Achas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to Parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the party "Tvarka and Justice".
However, in 2013 he and this party were separated and he did not receive an independent mandate in the Seima elections in 2016.
Now, Mr. Time is dependent on the individual social democracy and Gedimino Kirkilo's new-found social democracy working party (LSDD).
Not long after this announcement, LSDD President Kirkal informed the press that Mr. Time had temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Research Service and the assertions made by Remigji We are in a constant state of urgency, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to take all necessary steps to understand the truth.
R. Time temporarily stopped membership in the party until a preliminary investigation was carried out," LSDD leader Kirkiles said.
In 2003, Achas was the head of the group of advisers of President Roland Pax, who was removed from office later during the siege.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control R. Ač's work
Neither the mayor of the Rasei region, Algirdas Grecius, nor the current municipal administration leader, Luudas Kavalaiskas BNS said on the first day of the year that there was no information on which a specific purchase could be related to a legal investigation.
Meras Gricius said about Mr. Ačo's detention from the media.
"I can't say for sure, we have been very experienced by the functions, as I did my job, he (R. Ajas - BNS) - the administrative work, and I can't say for any reason or for what public procurement this has been done," said the BNS first day.
It also claimed that for the same reasons it would not want to be assessed by Mr Ačo to the municipal administration of the former leadership.
I was afraid to say something that I could appreciate his work because I did not directly control his administrative work when he presented me for public procurement, for tenders, said that such and such public procurement, such tenders, after which contracts were seen in the public area, were concluded, and I had already seen them as bears.
I cannot therefore tell how he led the administration at the time as its director," said Mr. Griccius.
He himself said that public procurement would not be successful and that they would not be affected.
In the Ministry of Culture team - new consultant
The team of consultants from the Ministry of Culture of Lianos Ruokytės-Johnsson added Dr. Jozapas Blažijun.
He will advise on the management of archives, libraries, museums, and cultural heritage.

The new Minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on the preservation of cultural heritage and values.
Not further worked than hot-rolled
The JJ recalls that in May of this year's Ministry of Culture's Ruokytė-Johnsson's team, Dr. Viktor Bachmetjevas, who consulted the Minister on public information policy issues, was also responsible for media writing and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renalda Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums, and libraries.
Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson then said that her new Vice-Minister had chosen the same area as Mr Augustine.
At this time, besides Mr. Augustinavitia's establishment of a permanent area of Mr. Blažion, the Council of Ministers is composed of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidius Galiūn, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Eglä Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvila: EUR 90 million for non-impact GPAIS business
Simon Gentvils, Vice-President of the Environmental Protection Committee, said that the Lithuanian producers and importers could have to pay almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year for the ineffective accounting of products, packages and waste.
"As the end of the year and as soon as the GPAIS system does not function normally, the crisis of the system package management sector becomes more and more real scenarios.
Non-officially it is claimed that only 1% of the processing tasks envisaged have been issued for the approval of the disposal of packaging waste,” said Mr Gentville.
On 7 November, the Seymón will start an informal meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection, which aims to discuss the situation, to explain why the functions of this programme do not work, why there is no actual implementation of the programme module and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to solve the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative change initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk and are again at risk of receiving major environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," said Mr. Gentvils.
In his view, the lack of the GPAIS accounting system and lack of effectiveness signalled a serious crisis in the waste management sector that could be compared to the "Metral" crisis.
Concerns about the tasks
As regards the fact that part of the companies may not be effective in the process of processing, warning and some experts for the 2018 package of wastes identified by the State.
In addition to the indicators for the first half of the package processing carried out by organisations, experts state that there is no reason to be concerned that some organisations may not be able to resolve the required quantity of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies may not be able to take advantage of the benefit of the clean tax and may be able to pay the clean tax for a certain amount of the packages they have placed on the market over a period of one year.
The GOC wrote that two of the three producer organisations currently operating reject such distortions and that one does not comment.
Mr Pocius, Director General of the General of the Green Point, said that at least the formality of the task will be achieved depends on whether the problems of the product, package and waste accounting system (GPAIS) will be solved.
The "Green Point" plans to succeed this year in the task of handling all kinds of packages except glass.
Although this year the school's "Green Point" task is not going to be successful, the organisation is asking members to compensate for the losses resulting from it.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
When the government plans to share coupons for food products with less-performance people and thus promote family or farmers' trade, experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system will create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Mr. Marius Dubnikovas, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business, said that the coupons have been recovered and the problems are not resolved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems to have changed radically and is taken from older leaders.
If we want to help the public to acquire something or have greater purchasing power, we have to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income and people's own need to decide whether to buy in one or another store," said Mr. Dubnikovas.
According to him, the government, offering food coupons, would make less income available to the people who received it.
"In fact, it applies to less income-generating people, to the thanks on the wall by means of a wallet on which it would be written, and we, this Government, have given you a wallet, and be pleased with us.
This sounds like certain anti-election promises, where they want to write their signature very clearly," analysts said.
It claims that the food coupon system will require additional investments, and it will also increase its administrative burden, as it will have to monitor what it allows to protect them from processing.
Swedbank, the top economist of the Bank, Nerius Macchiulis, says that with one instrument both objectives - support for low-income residents and small businessmen - would not be achieved.
"If this is the support of small businessmen, cash aid is compensated for price differences and residents can buy expensive goods in smaller retail shops, this will compensate for the price differences between the State from budget funds.
Then it's support for business, but not for the population," said Mr. Macchiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macro-economic impact and would not significantly alter the competitive situation of small salesmen, but would otherwise create additional bureaucratic burdens and could make it difficult for new market participants to arrive.
"I believe that this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with large administrative costs, and also very uncomfortable for the population, they should buy not at some larger store with larger sorting closer to houses but search for a few specialised shops with lower sorting," said the economist.
In other countries, coupons are used where the volume of goods or services is limited and must be given to all the same, or to some social group.
At that time, the inhabitants will receive coupons free of charge and can be released for food.
According to Mr Macchiulo, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax relief to businesses by working long-term unemployment or, for example, former prisons.
This practice, in the words of Mr Macchiul, was also successful in Lithuania.
On Monday, Prime Minister Saulus Skvernels said that the government's new food coupon system would help the poorest people to increase their competition, encourage small traders or farmers' business.
The Prime Minister Schirmanta Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea was most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get 20%-30% discount.
According to him, the quantity of coupons would be limited so that farmers would not be able to profit.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although no funds are provided for in the State budget programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps from the funds of the European Union.
"Not everything that is currently planned or not budgeted will eventually change Seime, so happens, can be transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, change can be financed.
There is always a set of priorities which would be a solution - or something to refuse by creating another additional source of income and similar," said Mr Malinauska on Tuesday.
To the extent possible, the scope and duration of the renewal shall be determined.
