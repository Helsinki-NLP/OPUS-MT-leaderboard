Biker reacts quickly and prevents harms
On Friday evening a traffic accident occurred on the ground road between the power station and the markers, where a motor driver was only slightly damaged by his rapid reaction.
Car driver's eyebrows
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to come back to the country street at 21.30 p.m. with her VW from Merlingen to the left on the 1230 road towards Machtolsheim.
This led to the 24-year-old motorist who came from the direction of Nellingen.
At the collision, hand and foot-brawl fly away
The biker was still trying to wipe out the Pkw, but it was still moving in the rear of the vehicle.
Through the strike process, the Suzuki was removed from the hand and footbram seat and the driver was no longer able to break down.
At the same time, he steered his bike in the green slopes along the road and let it run out there without falling.
Becker is caused by bone damage
With the combination of the car, however, the biker still has an infection in the area and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 Entrehelper stuck
After a Corona mass infection on a large gym in the Netherlands Momming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and cannot leave the operation anymore.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 beneficiaries were tested in the series investigation positive on the Corona-Arger Sars-CoV-2, as reported by Landramt Dingoling-Landau on Saturday.
"To avoid further expansion, we must take this step in order to protect the population," Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU) said.
In the past, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the reason for the pregnancy.
It is a large museum building, the fields, caves, coal and red bete – but only for entrance glassers.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "After our information it is a closed circle of people".
The court has been separated from non-infectious staff, and the area is now surrounded by an amputation.
Green and SPD gave the government responsibility.
The two opposition groups, the Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet, proposed to monitor the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be expected if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns need to be organized," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary director.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already requested a special control programme for farms with farmers with Ertehelps after the Corona explosion in the Wiesenhof Hospital in mid May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"If the health conditions at work and living conditions are to be checked from our point of view, we must be careful.
This is obviously not happening."
The explosion has come "with a promise".

Report: Seafarer pressures on longer advance data storage
The storage of pre-existing data is currently suspended.
However, after a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer asks for an extension of the time limit.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Bundesinnen Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) asks for an extended advance data storage after a media report - instead of the 10 weeks planned for a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seahofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) wrote a letter about a rapid legislative change.
As a result, Seahofer wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He said it makes sense to "prevent urgently necessary adjustments in the law now," quoted the newspaper from the letter.
The storage of pre-existing data is currently suspended.
It is expected that a decision by the EUGH will be taken.
But Seahofer wants the amendments to be applied to a possible positive judgment as soon as possible, it continues in the report.
A speaker from the Ministry of Justice said that it could only be considered meaningfully if legal adjustments were to be made when the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seahofer had already spoken with the Ministers of the Interior of the Countries in June for a preliminary record.
NBA: Strip Club for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Upstairs in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), the basketball profile of Los Angeles Clippers, will have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for an end.
According to US media reports he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these things.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers Star will replace the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the start of the season's finals on Friday night.
South is due to mass infection to the Corona position
München - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a tissue material for large farms.
The press conference will be seen on our website live.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau countryside has aroused authorities and politics.
At the large museum complex, nearly 500 orphans from several countries are currently working, and over a third of them have infected the Corona Emperor.
The court is still under quarantine and is shut down with a building.
No one can leave the land, food will be provided.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
In view of the lack of contact with the local population, the Landrasamt continues to show that the infection has not spread beyond the court.
"Essensbisse": The sense of the mustmatic fireman by Nantes
"My man has shown co-operation," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He is very sorry for what he has done, and the state was for him a release."
His mandate was "undercut by conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the case of a trial, the man is liable to a fine of EUR 150,000 for ten years and a fine of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged on Saturday night at a fire.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Labour investigations raised the suspicion of fire-fixing.
The now arrested suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after one day he was released again.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the evening of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent change in the church, he quickly turned to the field of investigation.
Discussion on the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss the conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said the basis of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the companies that can be threatened in the first Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work without: see Leipzig or Livercus.
In the meantime, it is not possible for the debate to find out whether or not it is proposed that associations which want to intervene in this Phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he doubted whether it was in the German Football League that it was prepared to allow majority participations which were prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to attract the Bundesliga place of business in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempt to ensure more competitive balance in the Federalslaga, in the end only weakens the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but does not lead to any more tension in mastering".
Even a distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern produces a turnover of 750 million euros, the Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and the RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are one of the first three associations already implicated.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, it has given people who have noticed this mistake and have been caught up in the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said about the adoption of a precious watch that had led to his return in April 2019.
"That's done me a lot of work."
The gift of about 11,000 euros had been received by an Ukrainian official.
"I've had a violation of compliance, and it was right to take the consequences out of it," Grindel said.
"With the minimum hour gift I am completely transparent and argloss.
Many of these were known in the DFB."
He never "made a cure out of the gift," he assured 58 years of age.
"That may be called naive, however this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Radprofi Tony Martin: Proposed career development
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine his careers further.
"I just cut off the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday".
Martin is currently appointed by the Dutch Jumbo-Visma team and had taken into account before the Corona break to finish his career after this year.

Argentina rejects the offer of fellow believers
The new requirements could not be met, shared with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our fellow believers."
The debt of the second largest population economy in South America is no longer viable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to borrow some of their requirements of about $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there's no agreement, the country's losing the state.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors had demanded higher interest rates on government loans and changes in some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government remains firm on its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is facing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation was more than 50 per cent last year.
For the current year, experts count with a decrease of about 10 per cent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest requirements of $503 million and was used in a limited payout.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It runs great" - this fact Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very fast: In mid-May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be present at the wedding notation site the consequences of Lutz Feller.
Six weeks later, early July, the promulgated jurist took over the work that the normal day-to-day business is running long on full-time tour.
"But I still have to come in private," she explains in a conversation with the Rottler publisher and laughs.
Of course, the short period of time has not been able to reduce Regensburg's food point completely to weddings, reports the pregnant Dingolfinger.
She is currently with her husband, who is active as a judge at the Land Court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least your husband has been able to apply for a short parenting time to ensure the care of the two daughters (311⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to walk out of Regensburg every day, they also have an overnight chance with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-olds.
Growing up in the neighbourhood, she is of course a concept of marriage for a long time.
When she visited a place with her family in the past few months, she said again: "The wedding is a beautiful little town".
So she was so much more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process about the free position.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramers' professional competition, her home at Niederbayern played a central role: after the legal study in Passau, she spent her reference time and the second state-examination in Regensburg.
After several stations such as Notarassessorin, including in Rehaua and the Supreme Court, Babenhausen in the Subterallgeu and Regensburg - at this time she also "in addition" studied the promotion in labour law - she took up her first place as notary in Rottthalmünster in the countryside Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went to parental time, followed the conversion to Regensburg.
Later she took up representation services in various notary offices.
If the positions in marriage were written out because of the near calmness of Lutz Feller, they have seen the right time for the full professional return, explains the 39-year-olds.
The team of their predecessors, who will take over the holiday performance in the notary place, Dr. Stephanie Kramer has completely taken over - and has also prepared a praise for the Canzlei team: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can leave here on a playful run makes it easier for her to take care of the subsequent breakdown of the private food point.
In case of children's garden, she has already contacted a local establishment.
And she picks up everything she wants, she hopes to be able to follow her Hobby too soon here - and to learn about the most beautiful jogging trails of the rottal.
BVB plant for Ligastart with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled at the start of the season in the case of a fans return to 20 percent.
"In view of the distance arrangement to be enforced, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmunds Business Director Carsten Cramer.
Normally, the Arena is located in the city of Revierslaga at Bundesliga games with more than 81,000 spectators.
In the spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization in BVB hopes that in addition to the normal audiences, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospital area can also be opened: "Of course it is a hit in the office if these revenues are completely gone".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not going well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for maintenance is limited," Kramer said.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB profile for its stock portfolio, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course the players know that its stock list has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in the merchandising, on short work".

They are so small and so early that neither long, nor dry, nor muscle are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so sick that she could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so beautiful that they wear both cotton clothes and especially for their mini windows.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and like," beautiful Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't, of course, cry as loud as big babies."

Teacher Teresa Nar rejoiced in the field of education.
Even if all participants were certain that the direct encounter in the theatre and the stage room would still offer additional travel, you will also see the potential for contact in the theater.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game business," stressed Director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz draft confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Fiegenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "feign paper" from the FDP and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of law enforcement in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the Eisberge of the Radikals in the AfD," said the FDP-Inland Politicians Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Justice of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart the closure of Kalbitz, which the Federal President had decided most in May.
Kalbitz is president of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Land Day.
"If the AfD were really going to remove legal separatists from its party consistently, officials such as Björn Höcke and its supporters would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because legal extremism is still part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and doesn't change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It tells more gangs how many French supporters have a legal sextremeer in the AfD."
Flowers show that the AfD will be re-countryed by less than five per cent in the future.
"The days of the AfD are numbered in the parliaments."
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially-dissolved "flight" between the Thuringer AfD country and Group President Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection introduced the stream as "safely justified extremism".
In May, President Kalbitz of the AfD Bundes had been fired from the party.
As he reasoned, Kalbitz did not present an earlier membership at his party's entry into the prohibited "HDJ" legal term and the Republicans.
Kalbitz competes for membership in the HDJ.
Also, the President of the left-hand Group on the Brandenburg Landday, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice was nothing more than the nature of the AfD: "The Wolf has only frozen cream.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calcium."
This Decision will neither weaken the Federal Party nor the right to fly.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen team is transparent.
You want to take another look through the constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not release the spirit she called.
A draft of appeal is not yet changing," comments the Brandenburger SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn in Kalbitz's case.
"This is where the AfD country association and the group have remained with their right leader until today."
The legal translation of Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday he announced that he would now be brought before the Federal Court of Justice in civil law.
North Sea Windows Parks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 terawatt hours of electricity flowed into the network.
This is 21% more than in the same period of the previous year, shared by the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea Stream to Festland and the continuation by the German Streamnet.
The wind stations on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have consumed more than 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh) power.
In total, the wind current from the North and East Sea comes at 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windwinds on the sea are making up nearly 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percent points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide for higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is in addition to the wind conditions from higher production capacity, as new wind parks have been on the network for the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were to run all at the same time with full power, they could produce a power of 6.7 Gigawatt.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for this; it is based on tennet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030 they will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the development of offshore networks," said Tennet Business Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not extend their capacity to sea, but they reach about 40 percent.
The record day of this year is January 2, when the North Sea vineyards produced more than six giant streams.
In the average, the North Sea windows produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigaugatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small Christmas celebration at 130.
Birthday of Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works of Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the common framework after the Corona break.
Many more artists than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the Art Association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern corner.
In the north of the gallery, the unit "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windberg party for Corona denied
The Windberg party will not take place this year.
The city of Freital rejected the three-day party planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people visited this city’s festival.
"We have indeed not made this decision easy for us and - in awareness of how difficult it is for those involved - until the last minute," said Governor Uwe Rumberg (partial).
"But ultimately we are responsible here for the health of thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands were flown into the fortress and into the fortress, minimum levels, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be maintained in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that they would not remain much longer than a folk festival.
In addition, the organisation and monitoring expenditure would increase disproportionately around a multiphase.
Rumberg was disappointed next year.
The city then celebrates its 100-year-old existence, including the Winterberg party from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saturday from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympsiager Value not to be hit in Achilleten
Akleiten - The six-time Olympicser Isabell Worth was the most outstanding skipper at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Akleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend at four starts.
After she had won a great prize every Sunday with Weihgold and Quantaz, she was also not to beat in the Grand Prix Special and in the choir.
On Sunday at the 15th-year-old Stette Weihgeld, Weigeld placed himself in a special position against Austrian Queen Victoria Max-Thourer.
In the choir, the Germans also made it clear on the Saturday on Quantaz 34 years ago by their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Wehrts Winnerfjord Quantaz belongs to Max-Thourer.
The most successful designer in the world is to establish the 10-year hengst in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first time ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achilleten three weeks ago, Value had won all of the most important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned there for August 14-16.
Future More Flights in Worms
The Wormser University continues to fly: The "DFS Deutsche Aflagscherung" is a professor for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the University and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and began in 2021.
The professor has the possibility not only to allow the study to begin in summer but also to be held in winter.
In this way, as many students can be trained twice.
At the same time, both at the university and at the DFS Air Safety Academy are equally charged.
The DFS will be consulted by the University at the establishment and occupation of the Professor.
Since 2019 I have been represented at the University
Since the summer of 2019, the first students have been trained to fly to the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management Study.
In this year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the benefits of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lotion training contributes greatly to increasing the attractiveness of the pilot project.
"In these times, the promotion of economics is not easy.
However, we are counting on the recovery of air traffic and long-term growth.
In order to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Schürle, President of the DFS business leader at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professor is a future investment that will provide long-term flights with a broad, easily overcrowded knowledge base.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the University and undermine our attractiveness as workers."
This also emphasizes Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The Foundation Professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it we want to connect to the existing cooperation with the German Air Traffic Management DFS as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's entrance."
The confidence of the German Air Safety is the same for the University of Worms' motivation and obligation to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In order to use the morning flight, the university may place special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professor for a double study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, points out: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in the field of air transport.
Today's signing of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the university's profile."
Rescue surgeon on A 45
About 30 minutes ago, the A45 highway was completely closed on Saturday towards Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic crash the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old was on his way to the village of Alzenau-Mitte in the Kurve right away and landed on the main plane.
Through the spring, the front counterbags were removed, the driver suffered slight injuries in his face and had to be brought into a hospital.
The injuries of the 72-year-old beifahrerin were provided by the Notartzt and the patient was transferred to a hospital in connection with the rescue surgeon.
But now the police are saying there's no life risk.
The damaged vehicle with a damage of about EUR 2000 had to be disposed of.
Heil wants to check other sectors by meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law violations are soon to occur.
But are they right - and will they remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors in the meat industry, as well as the strict rules against fraud that are currently planned.
"We are going to cover the industry for the industry and then take the appropriate measures for the industry, if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers have already warned against the general restriction of contracts.
After the massive Corona explosion in the fleshy Towns in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on a law of Heil this Wednesday.
Majorities should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in the event of slaughter, treatment and meat processing.
This should prohibit the use of contracts and employers.
Mr Ingo Kramer said to the Dpa: "Finger is far from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave if he does not want to fully abolish the economy".
Work contracts are, for example, for large areas of handwork, construction industry and plant construction, which are the basis for their value creation in the customer.
"The individual's faults cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts anywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial operation requires a manual worker to build a safety facility, it is a very normal contract of work."
The German meat farm is prohibited from working contracts and leases only in its manufacturing industry.
It is not possible to explain why, in the case of the distribution and packaging of cheeses in the future, other labour law should be applicable than in the case of noise, as the New Osnabrück newspaper (Summday) reports.
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry after the results of a review of the NRW Labour Protection Administration at about 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Loan was kept for protection equipment or rental.
It was also found that the situation at the residence of employees was often misappropriate.
Heil said that a relatively expensive law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, through "triking constructions" these have been changed.
"Now we have to be basically raised."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, measures not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher labour protection checks or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
This draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Workers in the Animal Health and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Grüne) maintains more intensive controls as necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do more controls in many areas of supervision: food control, animal protection, everything possible, including animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB's "Brandenburg news".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three deaths at the end of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When a ultralight aircraft crashed into a multi-family home in Wesel in the German Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died after reporting by the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people were saved during the accident, said a speaker of the circuit assembly Wesel.
In the accident, a case screen was found, so the police.
The "Rheinic Post" reported when calling eye goods, the aircraft was assembled with a hot air balloon before the crash.
At home it's a single or two family home.
More details were not first known.
Leave room at Frankfurt Opernplatz in peace
A week after the exhibitions in Frankfurt, the opera fair is also held in peace on Sunday night.
Finally, a few thousand people stayed on the spot, but left it at 1 hour before the start of the break.
The police had been using a number of officers since the early night, seeing a larger police presence throughout the city.
For the first time since Wednesday night this week, there was a ban on operating in the opera area where it was arrived a week ago.
The police were caught out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police investigations, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car hits: Young woman in case of an accident on the federal street 83 in case of Hofgeismar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old has suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to Kassel's clinic.
With cameras, the fireman looked for possible drivers.
According to the police on the federal street 83, the woman was on her way towards the village of Hume, when her car broke down from the train for some unexplained reason.
To save the failures, the fire weapon had to break the roof of the Pkw.
As it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent mais field was searched by the driver with a thermal camera.
The Drunken staff from Warburg, also working with heating cameras, was also ordered for the person's search.
However, the use forces did not find anyone among the high mausoleum plants.
The heavy injury was carried with the rescue vehicle into the Kasseler Clinic for further care.
Nearly 50 use forces of the fire weapon Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg were present.

Youth Tourin Master in Italy
Tourin - After a decided door by Christian Ronaldo, the Italian mastership was secured for the ninth time in series by the Juventus Tourin record campaign.
The team around the fifth world football team made the total 36. Scudetto of the association history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening at the World Cup against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo hit 1:0 in the middle.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer two days before the season of the A series.
The table area between Milan is back seven points.
Juventus was an optical advantage in the first half of his life without any harm, so Ronaldo met for a free break with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic was assessed directly by the 35-year-olds from the strategist border with a flat panel (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his show, after which Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
As a result, the smooth but decisive success was guaranteed.
The foot-and-mouthed foulelfmeter in the 89th minute should have been just Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjäger value.
"It is complicated to remain mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
In particular, the spiritual creation of his player was great, said the Juve-Coach.
The tournaments had not yet been able to make the masterpiece perfect.
Finally, Juve had to give thanks for the lack of competitors at the end of the rest of the table.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be king of protection, it is a question.
Because during the Portuguese superstar reached 31 towers, the former Dortmunder Ciro Reale after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth table Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona has already reached 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski has paid to win the FC Bayern.
The current Juve Prof. Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
In the 2015/2016 season, Argentina won 36 towers for the SSC Naples.
In August the "Old lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title option.
Juventus is at the end of the Championships League, however, on August 7 against Olympic Lyon, he has to make a 0:1 game board to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be expected to be the enemy.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car racers
Stuttgart - All of the penalties and court parts that have been threatened are given by car drivers in the course of unpaid illegal racing on the Baden-Württemberg streets.In the past year and in the first four months of this year, the police in the southwestern has already registered more than 250 illegal car racers.
Comparative values for the previous years are not available, but the breeders are doing increasing work: In 2018, the state authorities between Constantz and Mannheim conducted 155 investigation procedures for illegal races, a year later, 252 and in the current year, 151 by the beginning of June.
In the course of the race, there were fewer events organized, such as in the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the Landday SPD.
In most cases the drivers have been spontaneously opposed or they had taken the flight before the police - this will also be shown as illegal races.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 are mainly taxed.
113 Money punishment - 15 times in custody
Only in relatively few cases will the racer be cleared and also prayed for the case: According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2018, 113 money penalties have been imposed and 15 sentences have been imposed.
However, there are no points of view that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
More and more other car drivers responded more sensitive than they had before, said a ministerial speaker, because of the various tragic accidents and processes of the past years.
Specially popular for Rasern is the 8th highway, always braking car drivers out there to get space and use the free routes for a race.
In August last year, a dozen drivers were discovered near Kirchheim under marks, three months before there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at marketing.
A81 is the most popular "Rinnstrecke"
On A81 the police even registers more race than on any other federal bus.
With a Templimmit there it is tried to break the racer into the particular section between angles and gears.
Most highly prized and awarded sports and luxury roos often have Swiss brands because drivers are forced to move to Germany because of the high penalties for speedy driving and car racing in neighboring countries.
For the SPD, the Tempolimite cannot be reduced to a few strokes: "With a general 130-hour-kilometre temperature we would create this problem on the roads of the body," says Martin River, the transport expert of the SPD-Landday Group.
"The homeway for Racer would be significantly higher if one didn't come here and there was still to be legal with 200 hours and more along the way."
From revelation or image campaigns, Rivor says less: "He who is so focused on all rules and not only on his own life but also on the life of other transport players is hardly yet available."
ADAC requires stronger police intervention
However, the ADAC is not enough: "We are going to make it clear that we are not going to let racials down from the Templimites," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and further controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely will the high-tourish strength measures be painfully and severely severe: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people in the country die during the race, two of which are not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
There are two young men who are supposed to have given themselves an auto race in November.
One of the vehicles came out of the street, ran against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old driver died.
21 other people were injured during the race of the past two years.
However, severe punishments are not necessary in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The legal need for action to punish illegal motor vehicles more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

In fact, he wore a black cappuz powder, black hoes and white shoes.
Further evidence is against the police.
Ackermann sprints to win on closing stop at Sibiu Tour
Rad Prof. Pascal Ackermann has fought his second day at the closing stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer of the Bora-hansgrohe team sat on the 109-kilometre section with start and goal in Hermannstadt in the massprint after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's three and four for Ackermann.

Nürnberg: Not allowed tuning events - Police are involved, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated on a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police set up their announcement to monitor such events further.
On Saturday (July 25, 2020) it arrived in Nürnberger South City.

Illegal tuning meetings in Nürnberg: Only a small part of the "Seine"
The officers were well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
However, only a small part of the "Autoposer" and Tunings scene was assigned.
Apparently, most of the scene concerned came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on the ground, it is appropriate to conclude that it was a matter of primary concern.
In addition, the main proportion of those present was the applicable protection provisions, in particular the content of the minimum stay and the wear of a mouth-protection.
The checks carried out before the site were completed by 1:00 p.m.

The News5 Agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the company involved: "They have all the beautiful fields we can't cross," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for that.
Also because cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make any damages.
"Yes, young people should finally keep their cars safe."
Number of work agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse at short-term employment
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is following its own statement of some 900 cases of suspicion about abuse at short-term wages.
"This is very small in the case of more than 880,000 short-term companies," said Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter General Journal" to the operational business.
When many companies had applied for short work immediately at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to respond quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"So long we were not available in this hot phase.
So we're going to look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naked there and have a long breath."
References to abuse are often made by the employees or associations concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency cell in the herb.
"Will there be more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates are different, but we are armed for the case and are now training our employees in the labour agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency payments."
The numbers are still inevitable, said Terzenbach.

Austria: Massestes by Corona Abroad in Tourist Location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona explosion in the popular U.S. tourist site St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48 as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available at night.
Many of the young practitioners are thus infected in tourism, but at least one holiday event has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their homes on Saturday evening.
The time of suspension was set at 23 hours.

In addition, all the guests who were from July 15 in St. Wolfgang were contacted.
The explosion raises memories of the Austrian ski and party Ischgl in Tirol, which was a centre of Corona expansion throughout Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
Points of interest in the new infections are Vienna and Oberösterreich.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record teacher Manchester United returns after a year of absence to the Champions League.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table place by 2:0 (0:0) - Success against the direct competitors Leicester City.
The Foxes must now enjoy the European League because the FC Chelsea is still in progress and has also qualified for the King's class as a fourth.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was forced to Jubeln.
Manchester United went through a punishment strike by Bruno Fernandes (71. minutes).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-game period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the final opponent of the FC Bayern Championship League, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said Coach Frank Lampard, who is also at the end of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea-Coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also took advantage of a magic 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still at the Wolves and started as a sixth in the European League.
Aston Villa decided the ferdull with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for herself, however, had to sit around the classroom for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) appeared suddenly by Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) arrived because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which hit three trainers in the season, will be up after five years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, ensured a joint record with a 3:1 (1:1) at Newcastle United.
99 numbers are the highest value that the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
The scorecard in the English football coach Jürgen Klopp missed his team only a little.
The best brand is Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38), Divock Origi (59) and Sadio Mané (89) turned the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschuzze van Dijk after the game, "that should motivate us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
Satisfying should also be the Premier League box at the end.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, the football operation in England was suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed with an early break or an escape of the other games on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without audiences in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Head of Government Netanyahus are becoming more and more intense.
In the night there have been too violent side effects.
The Israeli police took a violent campaign against the law enforcement chief Benjamin Netanjahu on Sunday night in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for taking part in a riot, shared police speaker Mickey Rosenfeld.
The police set up other water heaters to solve the customer assignment.
In total, about 6,000 people gathered on Saturday afternoon after media reports from Netanjahus Amtsitz.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and netizens dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protestors beat drums, burst into their ears, and called Netanjahu back.
It has also been established by participants of a opposition demonstration supported by Netanjahu, reported the "ynet" news page.
Also in many other places in Israel, people were shown in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarearea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police raids near Tel Aviv because he is suspicious of having been shot from a driving car puffer spray on demonstrators on the street.
Another man was arrested after an attack on a demonstrators in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv it has recently given several demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The clients accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Netanjahu was recently also criticized for his handling the Corona crisis.
He will be kept, among other things, fast lockers and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has seriously added to the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was last over 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with Coronavirus in Israel has recently increased to always new record values.
In case of accidents at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter power on car - nine injuries - Rifle area - Image.de
Ahlen - On the Saturday afternoon, on the B58 at Ahlen, nine light injuries were required.
A car driver was walking along with his two children (3,5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police said, "Maybe she had suddenly broke up because she wanted to leave."
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who ran behind her, perhaps too late.
He jumped back on the car.
In the event of the accident, three insassins in the car and six in the carrier were slightly damaged.
Several rescue vehicles brought them into a nearby hospital.
North Korea regulates border city after Corona's collapse
North Korea has thus far seen a "lighting success" in its own actions to reverse the Coronavirus.
Now, the country is reporting a case of suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official crash in Corona in the country, North Korea has abandoned a large city in fear before a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological reverse measures in the past six months "may have been the worst virus in the country", the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation has been shut down.
The Communist leadership called out the highest levels of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the land occupied.
Nordkoria had not previously recorded a single infection after its own data and described its reverse measures as "lighting success".
The data were classified abroad.
The disease symptoms were subsequently identified by a "survivor" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person has moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned to the border.
For border crossing within four kilometers and most of the smaller military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
But after reports from the National News Agency Yonahap, South Korea's military took up the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There are investigations into some people.
North Korea then called on its own data on Saturday because of the suspicion of the suspect, an emergency attack by the police office of the party under the chairmanship of Machthaber Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could solve a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already arranged on Friday as a preventive measure, "to block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others," he continued.
The person concerned as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contacted her were placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party should therefore investigate the "outbreaking fall" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if appropriate, apply severe punishment.
In Kaesong, about 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Stress before the Council sitting: East City and Lärms protection are still ahead of a large summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the grassroots community will also vote in favour of the construction plan for the large project in the Middle East," says the press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of the Pforzheim Congress Centre.
In particular, the assessment of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the controversy.
Most of them are very close to this, and in some committees they are even present.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from citizenship and then from the administration and community council, has not been prepared by nearly ten years now, has been criticised by project opponents Reinhard Klein as "external parliamentary opposition", "unexpected", "speculating" and "consciously false charges".
"All I mean is to know better," said a young man who has been a member of the Community Council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Civil List.
In fact, he was following the wording of the contracts in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The increase makes it easier for the city to save up to EUR 8.5 million against claims made by the city administration by the Committees of which it is convinced is small.
The city is going to be quite different from the forecasting in the Council and from the sponsors from the economy.
The city was designed by its own strength and not by an investor: This was its plan B. One day after the small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group presented an alternative concept that also enables the project.
It also focuses on the maintenance of the Technical Council, the maintenance of the castle, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller interior design in ideal case with local carriers.
Play environmental themes centrally
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
In this way, the Community Council will vote, inter alia, on the learning plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzeim population from health injury caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, this transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political officials in the city are not innocent of this because they have contributed to the massive increase in traffic and noise, according to the VCD.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of the accession to the Baden-Württemberg Country Climate Protection Pact, the renewal of the parents' contributions to the urban child-day facilities and the application for entry into the smart-city development of the Federation.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona protection measures must be managed.
With much delay Tim Roomman starts in the new season
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Roommann started on 31 July in his premier season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of the supersport vehicles can take over the regular operation, the first tests are on.
For the roomman, it was particularly important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener spins his first round on the lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiums in the GT3 car.
"There are already some things that are different from the Porsche from the presage," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go to different curves.
But it really made a lot of fun."
He also had fun with Stein Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports cars in GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Netherlands was able to help his new teammates in many things.
"I am no longer a beginner in motor sports, but each new series also presents new challenges with itself," says the roomman.
"Steijn and I understand us very well and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Louusitzring - the GT Masters will also draw their first race.
From July 31, 33 superport cars will be hit by the noise.
A room man who is one of 15 serials, however, knows the street.
2015 was the last guest in the motorcycle room.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the streets a little bit," says Roomman, who started for the Friedrichshafen race community Count Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passports that have to be optimally met in order to be quick."
As soon as a roomman is real, it's going out in two weeks.
"The teams are poker, of course, with the tests a little bit," he says.
"At last we are very satisfied and happy on the first weekend at the Louitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the task of a hard-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races were held.
The current state is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at Nürburgring, ex-formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be taken into GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantane
According to press reports, the Minister of Transport of the country has been informed of the decision by the British Government to place Spanish leave after their return two weeks under quarantine.
This is why Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues decided to take action on Saturday.
Because of the increasing number of Coronas in Spain, the cabinet in London is strictly the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to travel without quarantine.
The new arrangement applies today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the arrangement applies only to those who are only on Saturday, 1 August, and were not introduced at night.
Spain is still valid in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which there is no quarantine in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in the past that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be held for Spanish vacationers," commented Labour Commissioner Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one made the move to say Grant Shapps's decision."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona situation in Spain and the outbreak of the severe starting barrier, the number of infections in the country again increases.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the nightlife for the new expansion.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the United Kingdom.
From unnecessary travel to Spain, the British Government is now exempt from the fact that there are Canadians and Baleares who are particularly popular with British vacationers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the new Coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths have been reported.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hyperschallenges for warships

There too was munition fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, there were not only warships, including an U-boat, but also fighters and jets.
Hurikan "Hanna" gets Texas: Help for Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's Atlantic season has been landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, heavy wind and heavy rain now threaten parts of the U.S. state, sharing with the National Hurikan Centre of the US Climate Authority NOAA at night on Sunday (Ordertime).
Governor Greg Abbott called for the emergency for many areas.
The massive Corona pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helper difficult, said the offer according to the US media.
Call out Evacuated persons to be warned
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott in the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
In view of the wave storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will still be intensified if it is thought that it is covered by an area which is the largest area of Covid-19 in the United States."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died alone in Texas following the Corona pandemic.
Offered calls for people who had to leave their homes to take care of them.
They should not miss practices "to which we've been accustomed," the governor said according to the CBS sender.
It's important that everyone keep their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms are also available in some places.
In addition, it should be tested on Corona in notation accommodation.
First, damage was reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Re-invented noise warning
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was found on the island of Padre Island immediately before the technical coast on land.
The top storm was first pushed up to the Hurrikan of the lowest level.
For the coastal section of Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and was later returned.
The authorities expected a decline, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior and support the northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was on its way at night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
However, the Hurikan Centre expected him to remain weak.
Following the forecast, it should be near the largest Hawaiian islands on Sunday (ortime) - then as a storm almost below the Hurikan-swallow.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected this year to be an average active hurricane season in May.
From June to the end of November, it was possible to count up to ten Hurrians, from which there could be up to six very strong verbal disturbances, the authorities had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the climate available and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 per cent, which a mean average even at 10 per cent, was at that time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his Government had paid close attention to the storm and was in contact with the states concerned.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard damaged

The Bayerns want to stop the lack of training on Sunday.
Flick named in his personal tripleform the three attributes he wanted to see from his stars on the way to the capital of Portugal.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show its winner in the next 28 days until the King's final game on August 23rd.
"We've just mastered the duties with mastership and Pokal.
Now it's time to create the special thing," said Flick.
Until the Münchner can be specifically included with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, however, the final obligation against the FC Chelsea comes first.
After 3:0 in the event of the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not be like the lost "Finale dahome" 2012 again to the Bayern Albtraum.

Formula 1 requires a special rule to show its world master
Since it is not possible to risk the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to grant the WM title.
All American racers were dismissed.
Run calendar is becoming more and more specific
The run calendar of the current formula-1 season is also in use.
Three more race lines were added during the week to the long ten confirmed Grand Prix.
In October, it is intended to be carried out at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting at the Italian tradition line in Imola about WM points.
To this end, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 runs at the current level.
"We are pleased that we will continue to make great progress in the completion of our plan for the 2020 season," said Form-1-Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 courses should be completed in this extraordinary season in the Royal School of Motorsport.
The formula 1 will end its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially announced race in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires three continents to run
The rule of formula 1 requires at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as is now planned, only two continents are threatened, there should be a world master.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to grant the title under "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cut short due to the crona crisis.
A return to the continent in this year is not a subject.
In addition, formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Abstaining Supports Criticism in Brazil
Because of the tense situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are glad to be with them again in the next season," said Carey.
The defeat of the American race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The defeat didn't surprise us, but the reasons for it we can't accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Great Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area has been significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams, which do not want to travel to Brazil, would also not be justified.
You are prepared for the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was in the famous lateight show by Stephen Colbert per video show to the guest and laughed in the interview what she had in her head when she met Donald Trump.
Climateskivistin Greta Thunberg was at a video show for guests in a popular US-Latinight show.
She spoke of, inter alia, her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climateist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to its uninterrupted use of the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she talks in a famous lateight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN-Climigifel last year.
Lateight Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with Sweden.
They not only spoke about their fight against climate change but also about their conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to link the focus away from the climate crisis," she lamented.
"All from organised hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are on the street," she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who in social media are stalking them or even trying to get them to commit fraud find them "hard", as they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was interviewed at a well-known scene in which she held a bitter look at US President Trump.
At UN-Climigifel 2019 in New York, for which the Atlantic Activist was sailing, its expressive view of the cameras was captured and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was created from the short Clip, so an animated image was last used for one of the most commonly used images for Trump-genner.
But what did 17-year-olds at this time think about US Presidents?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she just said, "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is needed."
With the warlike answer, the experienced satiric Colbert may not have calculated and disappears shortly from the picture.
With her "How do you?"- talking about the principles of climate protection, she remained in mind at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real estate with driver pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobili is currently in the race for Europe's Golden Shoh with Bayerns Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobili has the best chance to become a protector king in the Italian football championship.
The only BVB profile was run at 5:1 (1:1) - the victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona by three encounters, of which two Elfmeters were converted into the post-game times of two and a half.
As a result, the 30-year-olds from the fourth table had two season games before the end of the year, now 34 seasoners on his account - so did Robert Lewandowski from the FC Bayern Munich in the run-up German season.
In Italy, Christian Ronaldo follows up to 30 Towers, where the Portuguese Superstar met with the top-down driver at the end of the evening at Sampdoria Genua.
Fleetwood-Mac-Mithfounder Peter Green died
His life was like a rear train: After an angry climb with Fleetwood Mac, it slowly climbs up and then slowly again.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
The founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
If he had died peacefully at the age of 73, family members shared on Saturday with him in an official opinion, another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton prized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitars.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction from a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The fighter Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the most legendary band in London in 1967, so far his forgotten instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like a train ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a grueling rise - the band celebrated its greatest success but then without it.
It should have been given, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the benefits of the group for well-being.
He started to appear in large arms and with big cruzifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green lost the 1970 band.
It followed a social downturn.
The Bluesrock guitarist is under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographies reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in the psychiatric ward.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the scene.
He was to live on the street temporarily as a peacemaker and spent a long time in an Israeli cage.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London town of Bethnal Green.
He's been looking forward to American blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters for young years.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitars and five years later got the chance to be lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly afterward he was engaged as a substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
Green founded in the middle of Blues-Boom in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his blues breakers colleagues, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the first number-1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed its shadow pages: Green did not strengthen the media room, its experiments with the drug LSD were becoming increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and search in an interview: "The worst thing that happens to me in my life is drugs - it was best to land a number-1 hit".
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 had achieved an amazing follow-up with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac therefore swims without it in new formation on a success path.
In 1977 the album "Rumours" was sold worldwide more than 40 million times.
Despite various small solo successes Green did not have a bigger comeback until he went back to the start with a group of friends.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke from a returned Rockstar.
Free of drugs Green published with the Peter Green Splinter Group some albums until the band was dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blue legend - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decade.
