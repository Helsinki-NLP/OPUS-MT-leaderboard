What can I say?
I'm a little upset.
You can't sit with me.
She continues to cry when there's no time.
Have you seen Tom go away?
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they say it fast.
She didn't even panic.
What did that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
They all laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish the job on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna get?
I'm scaring you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head, and if you talk to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sun coming out?
She put her finger on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.

I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.

You look pretty bad tonight...
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.

I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?

If you need help, tell me.

That might not be easy.

Come run with me.

Have fun while you can.
Is that love?

Yes, I love it!
It was a bit uncomfortable.
Do you have a case?
When exactly did you do that?

I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.

Are you sure this thing's safe?

You're right.
They can never achieve it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.

That's what I don't look like.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat?

I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't need to do that.
I hope it'll be a long time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?

Everyone else.
Come closer.

We need to work right away.
I'm not afraid of death. I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met Tom.

I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.

The ammonia is the base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.

And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.

I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!

It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's just talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've got yourself caught up in a hurry.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got out of the car.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
Is it just me going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years have I seen you last time?
Tom was there for a moment.
I knew I should never have been involved in your stupid business.
We worked together.
Do you think I've missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
I'm all Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm a klaustrophobic.
The new border to Haugesund will become the main effective route link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire western region.
You disappointed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are heading towards something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Merin's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sports.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought it.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Shall we see Tom again?
My mother fucks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I heard music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
Let's go soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid depending on the color ranger.
I like that guy.
Do you like roller coaster?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you laugh at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to get along with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends touched her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoia?
Tom went back to his room, he couldn't calm down.
Could I get one hug?
I hid an empty cage.
Relax, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you ever make it up?
She's wondering how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a beautiful one.
Look at what it is!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from a crying school because her friends touched her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in the room, for a black big keyboard with dramatic moves of fingers, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The mighty wind blew a lot of grain off the stairs last night.
Shouldn't you be ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads through the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of steel.
I didn't write this.
I can't feel partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a moment.
Come in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
To slow down the mountain, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom's in a hurry.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live at home.
Tom says she's healthy.
I'm the only one who can do this.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't want to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for humans to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's okay.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Otuppa, sensitive kids can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
The police work is to prevent and investigate a criminal.
Can you add me a distance?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very fast.
You're different.
She doesn't know anyone else's hatred.
This will make our work much easier.
He loves football.
The Monas were able to play tennis in the monasterys.
No one believes him anymore.
Keep the kids away from meds.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I asked myself if I might dream.
Everything changes in time.
No one's going anywhere.
Driving to work from hours to hours.
It's right.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think that such views are just crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any Mary letters until he was here.
We're good enough for you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to split up.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to pass the passport.
I think Tom pulled out the fattest place.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a lot of pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books yet.
Come and play with us.
And it was just with a big pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math test.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Check this out.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think it's really important.
That's so sad.
How wise!
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I've been playing piano for a long time, so I'm still able to do a little more.
Is this your cup or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
They worship apples and cucumbers, not gold and green forests.
I'm taking my feet off.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I got it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're right.
Come on, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
It's time we split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The end of the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I've got a bad meeting tonight.
Man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a encryption tool.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go and see.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "That, do you remember what she sent you when she asked you to take pictures of the Epidje brother?" "Yes." And then she said to you to write a criticism of Mike's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a criticism of Mike." "Yes." "...Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips's scarfs were convincing, but not infuriable; and that Reti strictly pays things I think he should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How'd I figure that out?
I'm going to church only out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a sheep than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who needs to do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He burned the bottle before he got into the oven.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom's gonna understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's the truth about what Tom's talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your dick.
You're going out!
We have two TVs.
We like playing football.
Make a place.
The horse must have landed and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She reached her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, whatever it is for me.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand a lot of what they said to each other.
Well, leave me alone.
They like it both.
We've been sitting in silence together for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He's never driving.
Two sides will keep talking this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why are you wearing a beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in my pocket.
Mom just went to the shop.
I'm always nervous about passive control.
That's what you need.
Take care.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Can you jog?
Don't touch the lion while he's asleep.
Tom's not like that.
Could he be alive?
Did you just meet him?
True to be, I don't know exactly.
That's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient disappeared.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose manuscript is this?
Feel good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find some money.
I shot the bear.
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
He smelled like a bird.
Fire caught the first time.
Tom was very happy when he won his team.

What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've misunderstood this.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat was exposed to the entire length of the sunlight that flowed through the window.
You're going to school with dogs or bikes?
Tom's not much happier.
Shall I go to the party alone?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't really impressed by that.
I left Tom 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, beautiful face and young body, is a passing value.
I saw the mouse.
He's trying.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
Looks like they know what they're looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It needs a dream.
I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's no longer a child.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing it.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I've missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I responded instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked chests and bosses.
She's out of my league.
What are we really looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services that pay taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't yell.
Looks like we're just two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom did it in an old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's see it again.
It sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what you need to do.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the chart, he wrote, "Take your hair off!"
You're driving slowly.
What a man you are!
Twice, one cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why? Because this language is beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could that be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You're never on time.
That sounds like a betrayal to me.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you study.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't overdo it.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to make progress.
Tom was so scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt anything.
We have to run away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You'd better think about it when you're sweating.
Are we all here?
I'm sorry.
Tom was suffering from pain.
All or nothing.
Is he in love?
I got it.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.

What can you do?
Get out of there.

We're what we are.
Where'd you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're inside.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right away.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed by you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?

That's what's important.

I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it gets cold.

Tom's been there for a few days.
Tom could be here.

Tom told me to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not even mad at you.
Tom's a bookie.

Man has many desires which he actually does not want to fulfill and would even wrongly assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick from everlasting life, and die for death.

It's not supposed to be a stone in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to tell Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Not a vaccine.

All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everybody.

Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hall.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went there.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't do it either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom was hiding something from Mary and she laughed.
Can I look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously about the mistake of buying.
Your book is twice the size of me.

A cup of coffee broke my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.

This fish is big.
Take me a sugar, please.
It's nice to need someone.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to get rid of this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our guide came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.

Give me some sugar, please.
Come on!

I'd like to.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've moved my right shoulder.
You really need to get some rest.
What's the purpose of life?
Take a walk.
She pushed me right.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little faster.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a big success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
She told me one bird.
I couldn't see what it was about.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw it.
You should talk to me.
It was just not our day.
Take it all.
I gave up.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.

Finish this.

Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom doing that.
And you wonder why we can't bear your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame on her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't give support.
I didn't care.
Some of them were still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still think the Internet isn't a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What did you conclude?
You're created for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously about tipfeler.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little boy.
Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd like to.
You're my lucky one.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things happen.
Several of them have fallen in times of disaster in our environment.
I'm sure I've seen her before.
They all laughed.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
I'll have a job tomorrow.

So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.

I was just here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried about anything.
It's helping.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm very uncomfortable.
The cost will soon rise.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.

Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, people?
Will you help me?
It's not that much worse.
Tom took the chair to the next room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect such people.
Did you see it working?
Is that it or not?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.

I can't fix the car on my own.

I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips were thrown into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.

Was I really so happy?
I took off my wallet.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom's called after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't come to my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't even really a friend.
Did I release it?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
The little kids like everyone to pee.
She put her hair on the pilots.
He's released from military service.
I got blood on my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't want to get you.
Are we safe now?
Who of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might be trying to convince Mary to do that.
She's from the Sloan Comer.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad mass.
I'm scared.
Help us achieve our goal.
You're sorry.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't hurry.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.

It can be hard to deal with passion, maybe it's just sex.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
Only I can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The season is over.
I like cable kitchen.
I'll start with beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom close?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home in a day.
The best parents are all those who allow their children to follow their birth talents.
I'd go.
You're very unquestionable.
You've disappointed me.
There's snow all year on this mountain.
I don't think you should be too busy with any of these days.
What's in nature forever when everything's so passing?
The engine's crashing.
I'll see you later!
I feel lost without you.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
That's what you did.
Everything you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets that our e-mail to his mother-in-law at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of that?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane's late.
Check them out.
I'm in better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to sleep in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alco-test before he sent it to a laboratory test.

Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clean?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom's been watching the show.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's keep the discussion going.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and decorated in such a strange, harsh and rigid way that the little one dares to cooperate closely with him.

I've got a lot of this planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
I'm poor.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese on the tanks of the lotion or on the small cocks.
Have you ever experienced a traffic accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear an attractive suit.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, the legend has caused real competition.

Big boys don't pay.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for the next Monday.
The situation was finally dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm drunk.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Where should I sit?"
Wisdom is necessary to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the general public.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis ball.
Problem children are often without any feelings of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom was bleeding.
Tell him.
How do you get your balls cleaned up in the woods?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA ran to the core.
She gave me a counterargument.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing gold chain around the door.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881 in Solun.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate mathematics.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with it will happen sometime.
Tom's good government in French.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never suffered the death of his son.
I'm just doing my duty.
Everybody's moving.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the number of Greek islands.
She's always wearing fucking clothes.
Is that gonna get rid of the thing?
Mary put her finger on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom worked older and older than other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of these mountains is leveled.
She laughed.
The gifts of the Most High are called the Most High; the gifts of the Most High are the Most High.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're late.
I've completely lost the flow of my thoughts.
I've never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Are you talking Roman?
Tom came to see me yesterday.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known it all the time.
"I think the end is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in things people say I want to see scars, failure, disorder."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I rejected Tom.
I'm not as sure as I am.
I'm probably never gonna use this anymore.
I'd buy that one.
This is crossing all borders.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not so busy on Monday.
My sisters are both teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We don't have any other choice.
When it's this time, it's best to sit home and don't go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom was unable to describe any image from the wall of his living room, although he lived there for two years.
He's pretty good.
I've definitely had luck.
They all kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis ball.
I called him.
How many of that sandwich has calorie?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you're working.
I hope we'll visit Peking too.
You're my inspiration.
I've been holding back this time from commenting on my dear friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together in half one.
I'm still a little tired.
To make it difficult to maximize its own interests, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird no one knows the victim.
We're out of here in five minutes.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation isn't as close as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
That was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the pieces on the table that we dug up and discovered he was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
You want a fruit juice?
Let's order a meeting.
I upset him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom's still working under pressure.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe I'll go tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
I was happy yesterday.
And I really liked Tom.
He loves ritual.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get some help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Do you want to take O'Lad?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could've gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of what Serbia is, with their historic highest achievement -- by the generation of capitals and genocides?
Do you know how to disable the bomb?
Where do I leave my keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came by herself.
I can't believe you didn't recognize a born brother.
Tom lost his feelings.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
They're all laughing.
I played golf with Tom many times.
You're underestimating me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom told us to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can actually speak Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
It's nice to meet you.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please, come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, get the grass and get the nutrients out of it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Aren't you gonna have another glass of milk?
Have fun!
The odds are against me.
I'll give you a break.
He expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to touch you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom saw enough.
Shall we move soon?
They're selling sugar at work.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and peace, are real remem-work.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'm never gonna say this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in half a dozen.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom couldn't provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You've got a bad nature.
I'm on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a lot of bad days.
The whole state is worried about it!
I'm not a good swimer.
Do you love me?
Tom's got an memo.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm worthless.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary knocked on the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now isn't the best moment.
He's no longer a child.
I'm trying to check the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me do this because I did.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book to the top police.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia leave.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem in solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most useful person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do that.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks stressed.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came here today a little earlier than usual.
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never seen that before.
This has to work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where did Tom hide?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the paper and read it in the car on his way to work.
I have domestic spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorija Sturlusson's story is telling others that Christianity in Norway has spread by violence.
I need you to answer me.
Feel like home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I so different?
I got drunk.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant golden chain with the hearts is a necklace that will "stop your world."
It's all happened at a muslim speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
She fell into a lot of rain.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Here you go.
You're irrational.
I'm mad.
She was staying at the White House for the night.
You've got to let me out of the planning.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do what it's like for the first time.
Mary jumped out of the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Is Tom really French?
I'm scared.
That's great.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Maria are always walking around holding their hands.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
The disease is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I'm just getting out of here.
I'm sure it wasn't intended.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We've lost ourselves, haven't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Have you gone to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I've got a pie from the apple.
He's got a good look.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be told.
Look how much she is!
We have to go to the shop.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast I always eat fruit and eggs.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made us know he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of water is checked once a year in pipes, twice in bunnar.
Dear God, it is really difficult for people to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your views or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could've done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a lot of waste.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of a dog that hunts.
Are they still here?
Tom didn't write Mary for so long.
"Yes, a doll of help, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just stop you for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's important for a good purpose.
I've been thinking about it.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking.
Do you want to know something?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in an accident.
Two thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother isn't like other mothers.
He cancelled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How'd I miss this?
I'm fired.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Mary to be the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom will not vote in these elections.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I'm probably not gonna read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom is also well-known in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your desires, maybe they'll happen to you.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We've never been separated.
I've got 30.
Give me my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that time, it exploded with a big rat.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of Norway's population is able to access drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very innocent.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's quite normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
I've never thought about it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
It wouldn't be like that.
I'm really glad to meet you.
Tom's been parking twice.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the account.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Is there any other options?
The expenditure for the work carried out and interest on the capital invested was several million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
He never knows what's gonna happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sorry.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I have to drink something.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back later.
The sea's up, the people's.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any passports.
It's been a long time since I sent someone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom shut down the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Faysbuk?
Tom's been working around nine hours.
I hope I can.
I told you Tom was busy.
For you.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four times a week in France.
Let's start right away.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got a lot of sleep today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that was ever published.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep your mouth shut.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans have given priority to other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even children know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That upset me a lot.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
A lot of birds are on the border.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish I could remember that.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
I saw a cat.
In Paris the snow fell.
I hope Tom's back safe.
Can you laugh at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free tonight?
The three of us ate out with the potatoes salad.
Come on yourself.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesbian.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's an asshole.
The future seems dark to Edmond Dantes, since he became a victim of fraud, he was sentenced to treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irradiated.
Mother chose this vow.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Can you tell Tom I'm back?
She did what she was told to do.
I'm a cell.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad point.
You're one of us.
One leg is in the grave.
Tom just told me the opposite.
It's more loud!
I'm sensitive.
Tom's not satisfied.
That would be fun.
He's crazy who's powering.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I've been singing to you today, I've written them.
That doesn't scare me at least.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place seems quite different from what it used to be.
Why are the ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how it works.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me I wasn't talking to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in the walk.
This is so cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kede.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That's a lot of help.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
That river looks thick, doesn't it?
I can keep my secret.
Tom helped me write this statement.
We hate Tom.
This is so cool.
Tom crossed the track.
This isn't so fun.
That's a really big secret.
Mary said she'd find out the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't increase her pay.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is there any of this right?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please, wait a minute.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of the garbage.
What was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
I've definitely had luck.
What was your first song ever written?
Tom could get drunk.
I just want to get out of here.
Don't let him get you out of this good chance.
Be careful.
He's in college for the first year.
I've been looking for a soda juice.
I meant my family.
Can you laugh at Tom?
My current knowledge of the language is enough for many situations, but not for revealing my, often contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel the support of my heart.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I woke up once.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
He's a man of power.
That's great!
I'm drunk.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't arrived yet.
How can we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for driving fast?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's on the floor.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
As a majority of eight-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical works for the arts.
U.S. Secretary John Keri broke his right arm in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of grandmothers, they're kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are covered.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom was talking very loud.
Don't move!
Unfortunately, he's been filming an observer.
Did I release it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's crazy.
Florence is the best city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
There are indications that it will accept, which is known for its luxury dishes, this year will be something more modest.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom's gonna do it.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom will have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often more violent than they were when they were children.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who's saving words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look how much she is!
He's a real truth.
You're very unquestioned.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy such a thing.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been involved with people who never should have mixed up with him.
Tom's been visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve by yourself.
I've been over-increasing.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This has to work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's not connected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I've missed something?
Thank you for your e-mail!
I said I don't know what's going on.
They'll keep talking tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wasn't gonna tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as weak as his weakest member.
I've been there already.
It's different than I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now is the time for the children to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and broke up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and dangerous night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be known.
He's got enough money, even more.
We're glad we got you here.
Tom was safe in himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most useful person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I've bought some candy today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French teach in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna get better.
It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't worry.
I used to not like anybody.
The brakes are stuck.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's citing the song he wrote when he was thirteen years old.
Did you see Tom's gone?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
He's a lot surprised.
I hope it'll be a good time tomorrow.
Sit down.
Come and see.
Tom's really acting familiar.
Do your kids have their rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go spend some time with Tom.
It's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
The female chauffeur isn't full of black clothes.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save a dinar by telling me about an cheap place where it can be bought.
He can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working all his life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
Tom's gonna live.
You won!
It's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.

Tom's alone.
What did you do? Don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not sure when I should be there.
Don't open it.
Tom's already here.
I already told Tom that.
They sang Hawaii songs.
Tom spoke almost crying.
I can't wait.
Norway surprised me.
My uncle has a big family.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.

I've decided.
Do you have an example?
We're going to a bioscopic.
I wouldn't hurt her.
In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent print. You know that and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he would write it, he would already know that it will never appear in the press. I get my regular pay to keep my honest opinion out of the paper I'm working for. Many of you are also so paid for the same things, and any of you would be so crazy that you'd be out there looking for someone else.

I got a couple of friends.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
I feel a lot of pain in my stomach.
You have to lie down.
Can I replace this?
What a nice car!
Did they grow up these bananas?
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Tell me why you did it.

He likes to make a cook from the comer.

I'm only the first year.
I had a lot of bad days.
I saw the mouse.
Let me sit down.
What do you got there?
It's great.
Who are you trying to get mad at?
The bears are pretty dangerous.

It's true.
Have you seen me play?
I hate smelling shit.
Don't call me when I'm in the office.
Tom hasn't taken anything from me since last night.
Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, has been telling me from the very first moment that she's no longer running around her husband all day.
I bought a book.
There's no need to worry about it.
I want to see you.

Let it go, Tom.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did that.

Haven't you finished yet?
I really like your music.
How exciting!
How did I miss this?
I'm going to leave work earlier today.

We have to be quiet.
Maria refused the offer because she thought she'd be better off in the bank.
Tom couldn't say anything else.

You're created for me.
Are you busy here?
We've lost our food.
Mary made herself a wedding dress.
What kind of married life?
He's working.
I didn't care.
We're surviving.
This building will be built in the city.
Don't fight.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom signed on the steps of his new journal.
I can't even imagine that.
I don't intend to change.

Start counting.
I'm good at singing.
That's enough about you.
Tell Tom to make more effort.
Tom won't let us do that.
Life has become very hard.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that.
Maybe Tom's not hungry.
I always think about it.
I should never have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be fine.
I have to get used to it first.
Please, repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?

You bastards!
Stop talking.
I can't forget that.
Who's at the door?
I was waiting.
This money will really help.
It's all the same before the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart was concerned.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please, come on.
Is breakfast calculated at the price?
I'm sure I'll get that tennis ball.
Just give Tom a second.
Tell Tom to make more effort.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
I already sent her.
Check it out.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring's tight.
All we know is Tom's fault.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom took his head off.
So we've set up a little portable cabin that can be divided into two parts and can move anywhere.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep.
Let's meet!
There's no need to be ugly.
That can't be true.
Please don't say that.
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about that.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad time didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private detective to follow Mary.
I don't like Tom's style of writing.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
My French isn't so good yet.
Don't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
We'll never go back there.
No one knows what she turned into.
The fish is good for you.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I'm a beginner.
I'm already used to it.
Listening to music is my sorry way of letting go.
Tom got on the bus.
You were very quiet.
Get him.
Come see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy's talking like an adult.
You're watching TV again instead of doing your homework!
I need a shower.
I think I'll be back in about thirty minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on the island?
No one cares why Tom's a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty secretive.
Did you eat something?
It's easy to scare Tom.
I'll try it all once.
Tom taught me how to read.
Tomorrow is a math test.
The smile's infected.
They sell fish and meat.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never had a sleeper in my life.
We better get ready.
I'm lying to her.
Tom just told me the opposite.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out for dinner.
Who broke the school?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There are several reasons.
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
I didn't care.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom a lot.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know exactly.
I saw a bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I'm not focusing on it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like Dad.
Come before we can talk about plans.
Tom, do you like dogs or cats more?
Looks like a young man for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to deceive?
Me and all my brothers are sharing the room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's right.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
There was a new snowforest on the way to Ecescarte in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it was not known whether someone was trapped in the jungle.
I'm a klaustrophobic.
I can't fix the car.
You know!
Please hurry up.
Tom's aired his head.
Should we tell someone?
He's been swimming from the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom meant.
His loss of memory is more psychological than physical problems.
He's out.
He's starting to hang out.
Tom can be better.
Tom was worried.
Pauk took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was in front of his time.
Don't leave.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
You're not done yet?
I'll have to think about it.
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people in the car that I had to stand.
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary agree well.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass I see my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have saved me from coming just because you told me I shouldn't have even been here today.
This is going to make us a lot easier.
I haven't been here a long time.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's get this over again.
Whatever you're doing, don't leave the board on the WC.
Shall we see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He's been working ten hours indefinitely.
This is pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom is?
Tom'll probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I don't fall for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted it as a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Do we start soon?
You can't go into that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Just go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the entire work manual from 321 sides to the roof.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
What's wrong with you?
How old are you?
Did that happen to me?
I should be able to explain everything forever.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you mean?
It's freezing.
Don't stand by Tom.
I really like to practice.
You have to go to school.
This book costs 3,000 yen.
I just started working here today.
She doesn't like to be told what to do.

We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Basically, my dear Vodson.
History tells the winners.
I'm deeply hurt.
The writer of the book "Last Mohican", James Fenimor Cooper, was the first fighter to protect nature.
We need to get started.
He has a lot of experience and his competence has deteriorated into several areas.
Well, it's enough now!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm confused.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What are we doing here?
Tom's self-confidence was shattered when the boss took him out before his colleagues.
I'm not worried.
We've got a problem.
Tom knew it all.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not gonna watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set a big goal out of fear that they will never reach it.
I'm missing.
I know.
That's all I care about.
They were sitting on the floor, playing pickles and singing.
I can't imagine life without a book.
This building is blue.
I could eat horses.
It's really a nice day out there.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
It's the third city, by size, in Serbia.
What year was your car built?
Sit down.
He's a high boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where did they go?
Does Tom know about this?
What should I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't keep it that way in another half-time.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Learn hard.
A lot of imagination is needed when trying to add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked it out.
Finish this.
He came to visit you yesterday.
Tom's got a bad day.
Don't answer.
Did she smell the red rose?
I'd like to go.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Pride makes it hard to become a hero, who's close to the generation of madness.
How long will Tom last?
The rain season begins June.
Who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow?
I've changed my schedule.
I'd like to know how to draw it.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never changed.
We limit the back to 10 kilograms per piece.
We'll never go back there.
It's been years.
They set up the airship Joint Command where the Director and Chief of Staff were, respectively, from the Navy and Vojska.
Tom took his glasses and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try.
This is chaos.
My parents don't like my girl, they don't think it's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning and didn't finish his breakfast.
You don't even know what his name is, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a situation can't be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.
It's very light.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm a hard-headed man.
He fell into trouble because of lying when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his years.
I really like my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I got a stone in my shoes.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has young sister Mary.
I could use it.
I was very excited.
Don't shout.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I have to do.
Tom's on his way.
We'll call you as soon as we know.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really so happy?
He's got an insurance policy.
I can't stand up anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows he's going home too fast.
She writes to her son sometimes.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried he'll lose.
I think it's best to be kind.
Africa is a human colony.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.

I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We only need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm sensitive.
Tom used to be scared of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Are you speaking Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a little boy, isn't he?
Better kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You need to speak louder.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much will this cost me?

For every male man there is a female version.
Are you talking about us?

Mary's a village on the floor playing balls.
Before this decision comes into force, no one will even move his finger to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm used to doing it.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think about it again.
How's Tom doing?
That's what a doctor needs.
I want to be a man again one day.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I gonna do here?
Tom often wears black.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I missed something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
The danger of a hole behind every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom's selling cars.
Is there someone for beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I didn't get used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought a hat.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
Mom threw flowers into the woods.
Tom's not confused.
I have an impression that he's pretty arrogant.

It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
Her dissertation must be written in English.
Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
After she got to the lottery, she went out to the shopping party.
It's all hard for me to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
More voice, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep a few hours.
What happened?
The news satellite is a military satellite capable of controlling many activities on the ground, listening to communications lines, recording the working frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very nice.
I doubt you'll find it hard to get driver's license.
It's a depressive story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Maria play chess with a set of hand-cuffed chess figures reportedly from the elephant.
If the command already exists, the system will work which you can accept and send email.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take off your hat?
I'm really proud of it.
I think we should focus on other things.
Did your girl like flowers?
I'm a little new in this.
This should work.
You're not from London.
I'll call you.
It's like the third town in Serbia.
FIFA is composed of 209 associations.
Everybody was waiting.
Tom told me he lost his universe.
We've got enough here.
We took him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was divorced.
I'm just thinking about it.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used it.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean that something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom's back safe.
I like what you wrote.
Don't get hurt.
Where did you find this knife?
You need to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's vision will come true.
If we got here earlier, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
It's gold in green forests.
I'm afraid.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years have I seen you last time?
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom was sitting very quietly.
Norway has a lot of old empty chairs.
She worked so hard to finally get sick.
I'm not a guy who's following fashion.
I can't forget her eyes.
Show me your documents!
I've never tried to do this before.
She's getting divorced in a hot coffee.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom's writing nice.
She was prescribed a medical cannabis to alleviate adverse haemotherapy.
Come see me after work.
Are you involved in this?
So you want to learn another language.
What's tomorrow?
Tom put his drinks down.
Maybe he'll come to see us tonight.
The air-conditioning device is corrupted.
I'm not like anybody else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought I wouldn't want that.
Would you like some more pepper potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project, of course, called for a budget balance.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very fast.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do it either.
The guard's in front.
I'll be in my fourth.
We'll go through everything again.
I didn't get upset about that.
It's fun.
Girls like to play at home.
I wish I hadn't done that.
The train has arrived at the time today, as always.
Do you want to talk to Tom instead of me?
Norway is my new home.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone already told Tom about this?
Did you heal the judge?
Come closer.
Tom's not a real man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this competition?
Tom could convince Mary to do that.
Was I really so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What did you do today?
How much am I gonna get?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't eat only one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'll go earlier today.
What an adventure!
Tell me what it is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get lost!
Who's home?
I'm really happy to be here.

I'm glad you answered.
He's driving carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He's making such a fuss that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When screaming doesn't help, it sounds more loud!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was being ignored.
Tom wanted to take Merin's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm begging someone to do it instead of me.
You're still untested.
We're gonna have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom wore black and white shirts.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky, I survived an accident.
No one I know is going there anymore because it's a big mess.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You're driving slowly.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, we're gray cats, please, don't go ahead so he can hear you.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom laughing at?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Take me some sugar, please.
I'm tired.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
It's amazing!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
Tom had some help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you ever come back?
We all did.
What did you do now?
Answer me now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we have to do homework.
It would be nice if you could wait for me.
They've been sitting around.
I want to meet Tom.
We're on time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
It happened.
You need to go.
Keep working.
I'm scared with the kids.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The news came like a storm from the sky.
Now I have to go.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm not married to Tom.
It was a little weird.
What does this mean?
I'm bluffing.
Tom promises Scots mountains and valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be here.
It's not connected.
Tom used to be afraid of a dog.
Finally, we have all the names of the field in Norway and that will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left side.
Where's the toilet?
It doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our work much easier.
Tom got involved in people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave my keys?
I got 100 points on the math test.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm a replacement.
It's up to you to choose.
In 1989, Tom Berners Li invented a global network.
Maybe Tom's gonna agree to do it.
Don't put the lactose on the table.
It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day today, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep it in your eye.
Be home by half until seven.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I suggest you visit the British War Museum in London.
The day he was born, he got a cat figure for luck from a colleague at work.
I know everything.
Bring me some food.
Are you free on Sunday?
That's a liar, isn't it?
Thank you!
I can't just surrender.
Do you like it or not?
Life's going on!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I like that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.
Can we just start?
Do you know what this sentence means?
Looks like he lives in Britain.
Being-be is a case of ideophonics.
You pay me well.
Tom said all right.
I don't want to discuss this now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but he couldn't make it for him for the first 12 months.
Tom's right this time.
You're losing.
A lot of things happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm giving up.
What's on your mind?
I gave them a gift for a year.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really so happy?
Is it happening to me?
That's how I realized it.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Come on.
What do you mean?
Tom wrote down Merin's phone number.
They're good chances we're gonna win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can swim only about three miles away.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a douchebag.
The beer's good.
That you've never done this before.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I'm him.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Don't be afraid.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
He's got a big family.
The effect of climate change is much less expressed in Antarctica than in the northern polar regions.

He's got a big family.
You look a little better today.
At least Tom's honest.
We'll live as kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
You have to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.
Nine FIFA officials were arrested and charged with fraud and corruption.
You said you were ready.
They couldn't escape.

I'm tired.
Do you have Tom's experience?
That's really beautiful.
Both my sisters are teachers.
Food is necessary for survival.
These are my best friends.
I made a complete fool of myself.
I was already there.
I'm mad at Tom.
Can you add me a distance?
Her name was Mary.
Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom's been making it worse.
If you don't understand, you have to say it.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll call.
Don't be fooled.
That's your friend!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
The mileage depends on the conditions on the way.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?
The sun was bright, but it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom's gonna remember.
Tom could lose himself.
He asked me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
I'm awfully writing.
Tom used to be a footballer.
I owe you an apology.
I upset him.
Tom's gonna go.
Tom was speaking with a strong voice.
The investigation established that, despite his denial, the chief had to know everything about illegal settlements in his company.
We could go.
She doesn't even have a pocket.
It looked like Tom was more busy than usual.
Don't worry.
Tom likes to thank you.
Let Tom have fun.

Tom jumped.
If you don't get your hand cream, it'll dry up.
Would you like some tea?
What's the longest river in the world?
Just stay away from this.
We need your help.
What does this mean in Arabic?
Is Tom sitting here?
The plastic cup is better than what's made than the real glass.
I laughed.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them a gift for a year.
I saw Tom play a lot of times.
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
I'll take the chicken for my lunch.
I'm very proud of that.
What did you tell Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three pre-defined methods to achieve optimal results.
It's encouraging news.
You shouldn't go out now.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
These projects never end.
I like apples more than oranges.
Here's one secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let it get stuck in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What's your car year?
You're totally right.
I'm sorry for those of you who are possibly hurt; that wasn't my intention.
I told you it was gonna work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Crime must be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom's doing a bit of fun.
I shot the bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I've been singing to you today I've written myself.
You didn't make a serious mistake.
I don't like writing.
You ask me questions you already know the answers to.
I didn't see anything.
A few men got mad at Tom at the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom couldn't produce any evidence to support his statement.
I'm not so happy.
'Can anyone get a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
I'm not saying anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I get a cab?
Tom signed Mary as a payer waiting.
Open it.
Tom's very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't do it either.
Do you like roller coaster?
It's gonna be okay at the end, if it's not okay, then it's not over.
Move it, people.
Are you sardious?
Where did you find this knife?
Talk on your behalf, Tom.
We shouldn't pray to others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I break my keys?
There's a clear difference between the best and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Look at your work!
She was olives.
What have you done?
We know it's not true.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two children.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom didn't have a choice on his own to laugh and relax.
Cigarettes cost two Marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
It was supposed to be like this.
Tom was upset about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I get your dictionary?
Tom himself ate the whole chocolate box.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be said.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart about it.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain that in simple words.
Tom's just having coffee without caffeine.
Tom pulled the smoker out of the bottle.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom's sleeping all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Copakakana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself too.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you pay attention to my instructions.
He got tired of reading.
Can we order it now?
We can't stay here.
Tom didn't even think he was trying to convince Mary to do that.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also a ethical question asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally don't agree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom says better than me.
I don't have anything to do with my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the table, but I couldn't read it because it was too small.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We've got enough seats for everyone.
That was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everyone can get yours.
Tom didn't let me answer Merino's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to go to dinner.
Tom seemed trapped.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
He won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Have you gone to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go by the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking a day off.
Are you blaming me?
Last night, it damaged the table's availability.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I'm not sleeping tonight.
You're just wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How much money do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Watch out!
I'm not trying to predict the future.
What are you doing this time?
I'm tired.
Are they all strong?
Is everything solved now?
Please send me a doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Merino's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You've been spying on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We're helping each other.
Tom and Mary are other good friends.
How did you do that?
I'm not gonna tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom's got a smile on his face.
I'm afraid.
What's your name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom was really nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wallet.
It happened that I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Don't come to my girl.
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
I'm not angry at all.
Jimmy's one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Mary started to get out.
As far up as it goes down.
Life without love has no meaning.
I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
I'm firm against this.
You're underestimating me.
Tom's almost never making mistakes when he's writing in French.
The police didn't give up the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She imagined she'd become a medical nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The effort was paid off.
Tom asked me if I should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
Signal lamps are used to transport Morze's Azukwa.
It's not going away from Main Street, but you can get number 31.
The worst is just coming.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
A lot of people already hate you.
If I knew your e-mail address, I'd write you.
Tom could beat everyone.
I'm trying as hard as I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The government has fallen.
Tom's turned down a bottle of wine.
This will last forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed his goal.
I totally don't agree with you.
Get away from me.
Let me repeat that.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I'm working in Milan.
Come back in one day.
It had quite a different effect than intended.
I'm surprised Tom's answer.
Everybody's laughing.
I wanted to go to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book has been released.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That's the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say hello.
You should have been my friend!
People have to stop hate.
I don't think he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I'm not going to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother and her father enjoy tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They're all wrong.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show legitimization, registration papers and licenses during inspections.
Tom looks like a girl.
Do we have any of that?
How does it work?
We don't agree well with our neighbors.
Do you like writing?
They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Exercise has a lot of benefits.
That's what the students are doing.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father passed away.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be cute.
Tom's got a lot of German accents.
Tom asked Mary to start him on the back that he couldn't achieve.
He's there.
I was just saying I don't know what's going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write a name on the test.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's ready.
You're always working.
There are situations in which the victim is paid to obtain a long-term advantage.
Young children should learn to be sympathetic to animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you sardious?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother likes music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw your house.
Tom put his drinks down.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
The spa is empty.
Tom decided to "opposite."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If she did it for me, it would help a lot.
He was naked chest and bossy.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
You're doing it.
I'm completely free of money.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a second?
Don't let him get in your head.
She cut my right hand off.
Well, it's enough now!
I'm selling coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water, and he didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'll be happy to accept it.
Every bird of yours is flying.
Do you want to see the total darkness of the Sun that will leave Svalbard in the dark of March 20, 2015?
I'm sleeping tight.
Have you eaten anything?
Emma was very attractive at the party.
What did you just write in the paper?
I know it's illegal.
I learned hard while I was in school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Are you living there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They differ like heaven and earth.
Tom was totally alone.
The horse's here.
They all fell asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents anything.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, the great and international, in the large region of Tver, of the same size as several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned that his house was on a writing machine, and he told the teacher that he shouldn't learn to write by hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound so convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was good at playing.
Am I safe now?
Please write it down.
We didn't have this in your plan.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was obviously stressed out.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We fell in love last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't hear often someone bought a thousand dollars hat.
Come here.
That's what I used to do.
Are you questioning me?
Tom's been working all his life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
There's something going on.
Help!
I already ordered her.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
What's your name?
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this competition.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that technical sword.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in Parliament.
I want to be a swimsuit.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what's coming tomorrow.
What's the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm tired.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I don't lose hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us to camp next week?
Did you decide what you're gonna do?
Take care of yourself.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People are telling me things.
Hello!
Tom's in the pajamas.
Did Tom believe you in the story?
I was so tired I went to bed early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was wrong.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't mess with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give it all the way it wouldn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everyone's standing.
I made sure I didn't know Tom.
The shit can't go down so it doesn't stink.
Don't move.
No one can know anything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed it.
That's encouraging news.
Give me sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Happy Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt you'll find it hard to get driver's license.
Did you manage to do that on your own?
Is everything solved now?
How can mathematics, which is just a product of human thought independent of experience, be so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a real person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is "Muriel."
I ate fast.
That's what he's risking.
His wife hung his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Get out of here!
In order to change the red meat, I dug my little breast breast in the soybean sauce for tonight.
I'm always hated.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I always liked horror movies.
Something just got out.
I couldn't stop crying.
You're upset.
They're not mine.
I'm simplifying prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and it was published on the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we just get some rest?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
That's what I'm saying all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom's released a frozen breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where are you living?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when she's talking fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought some black shoes yesterday.
I've got a lot of friends.
Cirich is considered one of the great financial centers.
That's very good.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not hurrying.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get out of here.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Is it better for you?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all past, but it's a good memory of life.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easy?
Did you wash the dishes?
We fought hard.
It was a cup that broke the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we landed through Park Street.
The police arrested him for driving in a drunk condition.
We'll be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife isn't sharp.
We hope he likes people.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I was lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Go through any obstacles with this monster from the truck!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to friends.
He's always wearing dark clothes.
Happy was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children for the rest of their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I need to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
What's fast is also a kiss.
Come sit next to me.
I found him a book.
I barely managed to hide my anger because of her rudeness.
Butter is made of milk.
We can't do anything about that.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
