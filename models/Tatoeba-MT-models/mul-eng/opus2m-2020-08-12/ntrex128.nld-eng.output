Members of the Wales National Meeting were concerned that they would be ‘compared to Muppets’
There is an appeal among the members of the Wales National Assembly by a proposal that their title should be changed in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Well Assembly’ in ‘Well Parliament’.
Members of the National Meeting of various political parties are concerned that the new name is legally in place.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP 'removs on Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for fuck and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Plaid Party said the group was as "satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party ‘open state’ for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is spoken as a short one.
The Committee of the Wales National Assembly, which is currently in the process of establishing legislation to implement the change in the name, said: 'It is of course the members of the Wales National Meeting themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the Wales National Meeting the right to change the name of the Meeting.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptised to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Meeting, the Commission proposed ‘Well Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the MWP option received most support in public consultation.
The members of the National Meeting would now propose alternative options, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and they will have to make a draft legislation about the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the closure of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committees' system.
Members of the National Assembly will certainly be able to vote on their new title when they discuss legislation.
The inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
Sunday voters vote or they want to change their country's name in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an effort to resolve an amicable dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athene argues that the name of its northern neighbours means that the country would appeal to its territory and has already responded repeatedly to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum, said that he would not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin, who have the difficulty of Harlem
'The older people I spoke to said that there was a coffee and a church in every corner earlier here,' said Mr. Adams.
Today there is another coffee here, another church to spy on.'
He said it's understandable that coffee was lost.
'People now have social contact in another way' he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the village, where people go regularly.’
However, he makes sure that the proceeds of the sale of the Church's assets will be less long than the leaders expected, 'and early or late they will be back at the beginning.'
Krkken, adding it, could be replaced by flat apartment buildings where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining flight types of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of the people who will buy lots in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to the closure of these churches more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to this fleet will become members of the church.’
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists was abandoned in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of Elder John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could only rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Eervale Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beer.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Elder Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, he called the bear pride "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the beaard in July refers in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural scale’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beer in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the largest beer of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and receivers, some rented by the church's like leaders, others by the superstition.
The cosistory (the ruling body of the parishioner, consisting of similar leaders) wrote in July to express its concern that "the cost would be overestimated" to the cosistory, although the cosistory was not involved in renting the architects and adopters who had sent it.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the practice.
Haai conquers 13-year-olds who hit the neck in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the creative season, a shark has a 13-year-old boy who was born in California.
The attack took place just 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy crying for help. Together with some others he approached the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy cried because he had caught a snake, but then he realized that the young man cried out: ‘ I have prayed!
I've been praying!'
His key leg was completely open,' saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
'I cried everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was killed in a life-threatening accident.
It is not aware of what kind of hair is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told us at a press conference a couple of weeks ago that a shark was put in the neighborhood, but that it was then concluded that it wasn't going to be a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of hair in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Saninsburys wants to break up on the British beauty market
Saninsbury's competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and direct beauty departments are where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to overcome the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the billings where TVs, magnettrons and interior articles have ever stood.
Sanisbury's wants to double its offer of beauty and offer 3,000 products, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with explosives per brand, such as in shops like Boats.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up back to the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something that younger buyers still require.
In addition, perfume the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Saninsbury. The first is first opened in Croydon, south of London, the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Since more and more people shop online and are more often on a daily basis buying small quantities of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make it harder to convince people to trade with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Saninsburys, says that the shops will continue to appear more and more as wholesale houses, now the supermarkets take it against discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Saninsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habits since two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have resulted in more income.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothec a make-over, it was a flop.
Sanisbury's test began in the year 2000 with Boots, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose about the distribution of income from the apothecary division in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sanisbury's 281 apothecary shares in the shops three years ago for a total of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of skin care luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichi, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Saninsburys, said: ‘We have completely changed the structure of our beauty department so that this is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our staff, who will be ready to give advice.
We offer brands for whatever we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations we make sure our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer trade in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby returns from 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'favorable' because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has returned from a 11 million-pound deal with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old President of This Morning announced to Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons It's weird on Holly Willoughby, because she has recently returned from her profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘angered’ when Willoughby Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that they do not maintain sufficient time for Truly, their brand for homework and accessories by means of her new contracts (with a value of about half a million pounds).
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's fortune by estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his holiday apartments abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her future in the long term, and provide enough for the next decade.
Everyone was tired when she decided to go back.
No one could believe his ears before Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The main establishment magazine in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the president, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of large investments in products of cushions and cards to wear and wear, and because the launch could now take place further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, was president of the company in March.
The two seats often go together on holiday and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be a M&S brand ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin as the representative of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British ITV transmitter.
A source from Jones' visit last night said: 'We have no comment on his business affairs.'
Hard language 'and then was the love between us'
He wondered about the criticism he would receive in the media about a comment he would make that some people would find 'not fit for a president' and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump say so much?
Trump was immigrated to a news channel when he said:
'I didn't give up.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been finalized.
More than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore in June, the top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told the leaders of the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea does not see ‘conformity’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States goes through its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We do it very well in North Korea,' he said.
“We stood close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.'
He said his efforts to improve Kim's relationship led to positive results, ended rocket tests, released hostages, and returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this pressed arena, there would be about 200 people here," Trump said, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island where hundreds died
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were allowed to hear that they did not need help.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer lived, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid.
'In many cases it is unfortunately clear that she does not ask for international help, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is currently working with a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if aid providers from abroad can work anywhere.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still on the scene to assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia continues to suffer from earthquakes, the country is still particularly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, hiding places were built to hide at tsunami's, but along other coast you see these only rarely.
That there was no warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, although it was a warning of power, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances it may also be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship approved in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of the port infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent too much money on roads and roads.
But the government of President Joko has to deal with a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by continuing sectoral efforts in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are currently following a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the street, with makeup, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equations against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge needed Liverpool last Saturday for losses against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target in the 89th minute, during a competition in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's destination, at the moment his plane stood at 1-0.
He pointed left against the ball and then jumped in the direction of the worst ball.
The ball flew high above the punishment area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He woke up the spring of Kepa Arrizabalaga and got a lot in it.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much ahead as possible,’ Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
'I saw Kante approaching, and I was trying. I didn't really think there was, I just jumped on the ball.'
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The flower of The Blues created the ball with its skin to Matthew Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle field to Liverpool's playoff.
Kovacic did a quick one-two on the middle floor.
After that, he gave a fine catch, whereby Hazard could reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and pulled the ball with his left foot through Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pal.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes the Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The death toll of Tsunami in Indonesia runs up to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the aid agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the cave of buildings that were built as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of the previous Friday, where waves also emerged from 6 m high, said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is filled with ruined buildings.

Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has just started, but I want everyone who finds himself near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious or asked to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact if possible, if they've filmed something through a dashcam. They can always have information that is essential for our research.'
A spokesman from the police confirmed that the woman’s true body was found a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This morning came friends who thought they knew the woman in place to ask questions about where they were found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently bringing the victim's family up.

Picture of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'recording history' series
The connection of the statue would be a poetic justice for the tragic destruction of the many cultural and religious works of art carried out by its fanatical puritanical follow-up.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as ‘devil’ and ‘an effort to re-write history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: 'It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of images would lead to the fishing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclassm of the English civil wars was still authorized or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful picture of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the story of a figure that many believe is still to be recognized.
Dr. Goldsmith said against The Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, considered to be the defence of Parliament against external pressure, in its case of course the monarchy.
Or that is a completely correct proposal, it is still being discussed.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure that represents one side of that clan.
Its achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and reflected.'
Killable pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwestern part of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the last name ‘Yuan’ was known, was killed by a stake on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His fighter was on board and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm prepares for the pollinating of pigs at a pig market, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He would have spent Wednesday with his nephew from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his neighbor found him dead and found a door open to a nearby pigeon.
According to the nose, there is a large male pig with blood on its back in the pigeon.
According to a federal study, the pig killed the farmer for 250 kg, so the report.
‘The legs of my nephew were bleeding and wet,’ said the nephew with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras it is seen that Yuan Thursday arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. to carry out his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his nephew.
One market operator told the Evening News that it was closed to prevent the other from attacking, while the police collected evidence.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig took a woman and her husband to their farm in Massachusetts, where the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg pig from Wales hit a farmer against his tractor until his wife took the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was born in 2012 by his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that dogs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can be eliminated.
'They're just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The start of the Rosa Orcan brings heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As foretold, Colonel Rosa from now on has reached the cool waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, bring lasting rain to the north of Mexico and the south-west in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour Rosa was on Sunday morning at 5 hours a local time of category 1, and is 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's going to land on Sunday to the north.
Meanwhile, a tree begins to form above the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California skiing country on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is forced northward, to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical rain will cause widespread severe rainfall in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to a drop of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the south-west, especially above most of Arizona.
There are rapid floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very much.
It is strongly advised to walk into the desert when the tropical rain falls.
The heavy rain can turn reefs into desert rivers, and otherwise it will cause local winds and dust.
The next road leads some heavy rains to parts of the southern California coastal line.
There are rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small peak streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain fall of the region in the rain season.
Spreaded tropical regions will be close by Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rains will be expanded at the end of the day and Tuesday.
A severe rain fall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October the temperature in the U.S. can melt strongly because the North Pole is becoming cooler, but the troops remain properly warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., it would start to be expected to heat in October, with temperatures exploding around 30°C, from the southern layers to parts of the north-east.
In New York, the Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance is large until mid-October at higher average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people are looking at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people are looking at one of the six television networks on Thursday at the upcoming testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an encounter that lasts for eight years.
In the meantime, the political impact continued, while the regular programming was interrupted for the surprise of the day: an agreement which was arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the complaint for a week.
Ford told the Senate Commission for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was pregnant and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a well-known witness that he was 100% sure that this wasn't happening.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have been observed on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking at an office.
For comparison: this is about for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscar race.
Fox News Channel, which gave all support to Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million spectators, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the public was also very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the former Republic made a statement that it would support Kavanaugh with its vote, CNN and CBS's cameras recorded on the Friday morning that bidders were voting for him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his undercover eyes while he was arrested, living on CNN.
'I'm standing here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried: ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had made a statement, and a floor for the lift lock, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various delegates sent out all their lives when the judicial committee later had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour of your understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the following week, something that the Democrats of the minority would change.
Fleke was convinced among others by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flexibility was important because it was clear that the Republics would not have the votes necessary to manage Kavanaugh properly without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May politician criticized her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and lowering national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson highlighted his attack on her so-called Chechers plan for Brexit, saying that her proposal that Great Britain and the EU should be 'absorbed' within each other.
Sky Party Wade Sims: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison for murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities brought out a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost their glasses during the war.
The police found the mirror at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the mirror, reports WAFB, a television station of CBS.
The police questioned Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wade with death.
His town is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
On Friday, the congregation's headmaster in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is an accident in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime strike, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to arrest.
Director of sport Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'introduction and pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm big and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He received an average of 5.6 points last season and 2.6 rebounds per race.
On Friday morning, LSU-Basket Balcoach Will Wade said that the team 'cap' and 'in shock' were killed by Wades.
"This is an event you always hope it will never happen," says Wade.
Volcanic ash in Mexico City
The ash emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern areas of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Rampen Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was concentrated and 183 gas emissions and were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times around and trilling.
Social media shows photos of a thin low than on car routes in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geofysci has seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers south of the capital. That is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake hit Mexico’s central judge’s scale of 7.1.
The volcano called ‘Don Goyo’ has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists at the spring of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists were hit by the police, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia which split the region into two groups.
A group of massed pro-separatists who were opposed by the police were shocked by the officers with eggs and powder dust, which caused dark dust clouds to emerge in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, insurance frauds broke out with the police, and the agents pulled their button up to stop the fighting.
More than an hour sang pro-independence groups: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents scream 'Long live Spain'.
Four people were treated for slight injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The efforts remain high in the region of independence, one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but which has been violated by separatist Catalans.
The voters are talking too much to be independent, although the rise was low and the people against separation are the vote boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the voting areas of the region, where it became violent.
Pro-Independence groups had spent the night of Friday on Saturday to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration went through, but one was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, together with his wife, attended the separatist protest, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospects of Catalonia for independence.
‘Last year we have accompanied one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw how my parents cried with joy because they could vote, but now we're sure," he said.
Although the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties in December won an essential victory in the regional elections, although it was niptial, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their well-known leaders are always absent, either in exile or in prison awaiting a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mount who was filming the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was halted by politicians on both sides.
'The tensions are getting higher,' he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the progress of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,' he said.
Londonerry: men arrested after being hit by a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly hit in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19.30 p.m. on local time for Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at a given moment a crossboard has also been dropped on the car.
Livingston won with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga target
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerard was second down in a series of 18 competitions since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's target made the difference and Gary Holt's strike came at the same height as Hibernian.
Gerrards didn't make this season to win an external battle during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against Leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna received Thursday in the European League.
Livingston remains inconsolable. The strike now takes six battles after each other in his department, and coach Holt has not been down since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's strike long before the first goal could have been a priority. Its direct way of games worried everyone about all kinds of problems at the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he didn't succeed in making it down with a target. Then Alan Lithgow, who was raising Craig Halkett's headball, hit the ball above the target.
The home plays the Rangers with a lot of fun, and waited for his chances to be calm and secure.
And that ultimately led to the crucial point.
The Rangers set up a free trap and Livingston provided for an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who was escorted from the penal area.
At that time the Rangers had been having ballistics all the time, but the defense of the home was inevitable and target Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos took care that Kelly had to avoid a target.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the foot of Rangers-Doelman Allan McGregor and Lithgow lost the goal after a presentation of his colleagues from Livingstone.
On the other hand, the capital area of Livingston was threatened, but they were turned into each other. Two times a criminal coup was refused, one after Halketts attacked invasive Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
"Livingston's Phenomenaal" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont van BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played extremely well and remained above expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and composition of their suit have been almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has raised the team since its arrival.
He had so much luck.
Actor Halkett was fantastic, with excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running all the way to the tops of their tanks.
But the Rangers didn't know how to break up.
Even though they played very well under Gerard this time, they did not reach their normal level.
Their final phase wasn't good enough (they just managed to get home once) and the Rangers will now realize that they should play better. They're always somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared their meals on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO members.
They are not even on issues such as human rights, freedom of movement and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Keulen to open a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police resorted to security reasons when they forced the crowd of 25,000 people to assemble for the mosque, but many sympathetic people came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also heard their voice, condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the distribution of a visitor marked by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after driving
In London, a biker is surrounded by a boat that involved a car.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died somewhere.
A few months ago another biker died in an accident with a refugee movement on Children's Street, about half a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were in the process of identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road has been closed at various places, buses are re-routed and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six Cypriots injured in order violations
Six Cypriots were injured in an order breach in a severely secured prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The undisputed Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still on its way.
Specialised 'Tornado' chips have been installed to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The Cypriots were treated locally for light injuries.
A spokesman for the Prisoner said: ‘There is a special training for prison personnel for an actual incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible are referred to the police in any case and may have to remain behind the tracks.'
In HMP Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he was reported to have been treated by the prison director at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the police were called to the prison for a serious disturbance of order, where staff were attacked by billiards.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen next week, because the remaining energy of Colonel Rosa moves about the south-west of the desert area, causing risks for flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has given warnings of sudden floods to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is going to hang on Tuesday level above Phoenix. Monday night it's going to rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘Since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcaan within 40 miles of the border of Arizona.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres below, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, will probably receive rain from 3 to 5 cm, and here and there are 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rain will probably be favourable because the southwestern is currently going through a drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current pressures are identified is more than 40 per cent of Arizona's extreme pressure, reported weather.com.
The route of Orcan Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California skiing country in Mexico.
Rosa is still on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves northward with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific. It weakens them.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday morning or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be severe rain in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of overflow.
‘The proposal of total 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwestern of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa is moving north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona in the early eighth century as a tropical depression which will then take place in the middle of the night by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger that Rosa or her flight is expected is a very severe rain fall in Baja California, northern Sonora, and southwestern of the desert area’ said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains will be expected to lead to life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsumer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
The teenager was hit on Saturday about 4 o'clock at local time in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition was ‘stabil’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, so the police of Avon and Somerset were arrested.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has passed under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the uncooperative and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trup said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh continued to 'be past among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday for Congress and rejected strong and emotionally the anxiety of Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually active decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her concern during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the ‘American people’s ‘the strange and incredible character, quality and courage’ of Kavanaugh saw that day.
‘A vote to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a vote with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is recognized, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,’ he told the numerous representatives in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
‘About five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part," he said.
'That's why I'm coming up everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'send resistance and stop us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held on Friday at the end of the day, told a top GOP-leader to CNN.
Hundreds died from Indonesian earthquake, tsunamis, and the toll is getting worse
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were wiped out when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had arrived on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of about six meters high above land at the time it began to shake. Many people broke down and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
‘When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They didn’t run away immediately and were the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the Indonesian relief agency during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he slept cars, trees, houses with him, he hit everything on the ground,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami with a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before he reached the coast.
Some people jumped into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On aerial photos released by the aid agency in natural disasters it is to see that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been destroyed and stopped and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town remained surrounded by nightmares.
The number of earthquakes has been felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released at the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb that occurred in the Second World War on Hiroshima.
It is possible that the city's geography, which is located at the end of a long, small bay, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘seemly’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were located.
Some fatal casualties were found under the roof of broken buildings, he said. About 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Doghía, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Dothraa 'ly complete plate, we have no information', Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'It's already a tragedy, but it can become even worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organisation received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur pictures shared on social media, it is to hear how a man at the top of a building in panic screams to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and cars are fitted.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis provided for a large power surge that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending aircraft with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuations are still urgently needed for food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only open to aid and is closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Dodenol of Tsunami increases over 800.
It's very bad.
Of course, World Vision staff from Dothraa arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in their office were looking for shelter in tents of blankets, but passing along paths of destruction, Doseba said.
'They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began with the difficult task of carrying out emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can be allowed only if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It is still a disaster at provincial level,' said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As long as the government says ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status is not yet issued.’
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday many on Palu, friends and family of the missing hope that they would return to their loved ones, such as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like these.
On Saturday a young man was taken out of a wheelchair.
On Sunday assistants released a woman who had stood under the pillow for two days with the appearance of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subbandon, the coach of the Indonesian National Paralysing Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had previously taken place in Indonesia this month.
His students also stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandzi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,’ he said.
Dr. Gendon said that the news about the Roa Roa Hotel had spread into the parallel community and that in the hours following, he had sent unexpected News WhatsApps to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, there is only one grey angle in its messages instead of two blue angles.
‘I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,’ he said.
Dieves steal $26,750 while saving money in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning they stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press report from Newport's police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was on his way, another man ran behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects, so the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
For information on the identity of the fathers, please contact Newport's police at No. 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name in Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words ‘It has been officially known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West is already called Ye short road and used this name as title for its eighth album, which appeared in June.
The change of name was announced in the course of his events on Saturday Night Live, where he will be expected to propose his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has canceled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the director of the show.
You are not just a short summary of his current artistic name. Rather, West said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
According to me, ‘ye’ is the most outstanding word in the Bible, and in the Bible means ‘you’,’ said West earlier this year, when he told radio representative Big Boy about the title of his album.
‘As long as I am you, I am us, we are it.
I am overcome by Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
Instead, the album is a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the connection sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President does not promise to use force against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country stands at the foot of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza Saturday that he would ‘never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at the plane, killing 300 people. In that period left students moved throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and open more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the funding of A.I.
The United States should be more active in the field of artificial intelligence than in the case of A.I. research, says the investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this on the basis of the announcements about A.I. coming from different sections of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal A.I. strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be on the level of A.I. innovations.
‘The research budget for A.I. would be already a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next transition in A.I.’ said Lee.
A duplication of funding can lead to a duplication of the possibility of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that hit the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google department.
Lee spoke out of appreciation for technological struggles organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the next viewers.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
'China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years called for the best powers of universities to work on A.I..
Lee said that the American efforts at the A.I. level would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'As a doctor at A.I. level, you should automatically get a green card,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic staff such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the American Ministry of Defence directed a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced to the White House the formation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence is already in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change in their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in their country's name in the 'North-Macedonia Republic', which would prevent Greece from applying for membership of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece has a province also known as Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbours contains the country's claim for Greece's territory.
In June, the two authorities concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists found that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he was not going to vote in the referendum and, by means of a boycott campaign, it is not certain that the required 50 per cent event will be held, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot was formulated as follows: ‘Are you a member of the NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Representatives of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia was divided.
'I am today voting for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the European Union's umbrella, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, thereby determining it.
In order to change the name, it would require a secondness in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters came to vote.
'I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change in the name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium for the Parliament in Skopje and placed it in front of tents placed by people who were the referendum boycotts.
"We are the representatives of the NAVO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a backport," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can return to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will deliver the necessary investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the majority is more than 80 per cent of our citizens are the EU and NATO' Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' would result in 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-seven percent of them would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious challenge to the pro-West Government's policy since it came into force in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and short
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short matches with Brighton's defense in the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester City. Manchester City won the competition with 2-0.
It looked like a hundredth of a century, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian spy first got the ball played in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to be more defensive and was too quick for some others at the border of the capital of Brighton.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right-hand shoes to attack targetman Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has suffered problems with his feet,’ said the coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.'
But it was Sterling who the Sky Blues gave the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's play field.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left bank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball close to him and then sent Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues player just pointed it in, level before he was gone.
City takes the Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hopenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The competition takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Skerzer wants to play and does not make Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was no reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer wants to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Doggers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least one wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to put everything in place to ensure their first title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, at least we can point to science that the sphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in there?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be appointed on Sunday, but they are reluctant to set up Scherzer as a speaker in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th day, stood in the field of entertainment and would still point to the next Sunday, although it is normal for his rest day.
Washington's right-hand shooter is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘All we have already accomplished is on the game in November.
Over five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big choices I don't take part, but I actually do.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back the power regardless of what they have to do for it.
It doesn't make them suffer, who they must remove to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'send resistance and stop us'.
'And that we have seen in the past four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'bad and bad and common and false and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is appointed in the Senate Committee for Justice, which led to a loud appeal from the public.
‘Do you know what she answered?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body steel, the worst body steel I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the newest in a whole series of Labour Members who should have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My honourable Member, Mr Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because of her resolution against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough of similar issues as those in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour conference on Friday, it was stated: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and is the promise of a 'terrible, sweeter' policy that has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political perspective as I was concerned, were immediately expecting me to take a turn and take a position where I would never have agreed otherwise on issues such as national security to the European Union market.
When I speak for a public, as I say, there are social media scandals calling for the rejection of my candidate as a member of Parliament for the following elections, where the policy of the centre is put at stake and I am told that I should not be a member of Labor.
And that's just what I'm doing.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments on my address are general politics.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have a bad influence on sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let them slow down.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this period of policy is that large-scale parties appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer those broad churches and with every ‘moment of mistrust’ or change of electoral rules, the party is becoming smaller.
I have often received the advice of the past two years to make my decision, not just to preach my opinion, and then I would 'not come into trouble'.
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I was a student from Labor 32 years ago, caused by the neglect of Thatcher's government, which caused me to literally break down my class, I have always provided better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a congregation council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my policy secret, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my political positions and my points of contention with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are now members of Labor or not: I am proud of you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate as a member of Parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Age 38 - 17 Melrose: Unfailing Air on the way to the top
Two late tri's may have pulled the final result anywhere, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this glorious competition of the day in the Tennt's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the class, the only infamous team of ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning, and coach Peter Murchie may have been satisfied.
"We have had it until then in our struggle and we are still in trouble, so I am a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: 'All honor to Ayr, they have their chances better than we.'
Grant Anderson's trip in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Cup (which he received during the Warriers' contest) Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot managed to break a trip.
Climo took care of an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. So it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half good and Patrick Anderson's trio, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the priority to five points.
The competition was long silent for a serious injury of Ruarah Knott, which was carried out on a brandcard, and once the competition was resumed, Ayr could continue through a trial of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
When the carrier Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again counted Melrose off with the extra man then no conversion followed a trick by Bruce Colvine at the end of a competition where pressure was very high.
However, the shelter came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the enchanting Air Maul for a touch-down at the Penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe rebooted the box kick of David Armstrong's birth and halfback Gregor Henry left for the fifth trire of the home.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It appears that Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the horeca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, where he writes and acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next nine series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already on schedule.
According to official data, he is the director of Aopionmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun lets them know that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'bleating restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailing patrols in a year-old marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag is used.
On all the marine bases of the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the country around Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country must have faced after a bloody 19th-century conflict of raw materials in Chile is still alive, just as it needs to be preserved in the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice, which should be consulted on 1 October after five years.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and looks naturally with positive prospects for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court's statement on large screens, hoping that the court in Den Haag will be in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after a decade of rough talks, is obliged to grant Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic home president of Bolivia, who is next year for a controversial struggle for reelection, is much on the game with the speech of Monday.
'We are very close to returning to the Pacific Pacific,' he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to access the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the International Court of Justice's statement is only six months after the closing statements, indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the past four years, perhaps the situation has become even worse.
‘The case of access to the sea has been purchased by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The war-stricken rhetoric of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile may still have been completely submerged, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at a certain time, but it will be especially difficult to speak further.
The two countries have not been embassies in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who is representative of Bolivia in De Haag, denied that the decision of the court was taken very quickly.
Monday, Bolivia will ‘be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘make an end to 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political tool.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Pacific,’ he added.
‘The speech is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never eliminate its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
The General Meeting of the United Nations will be held on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the point of relaunching the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'toupie' that the continued sanctions and the American challenge against a declaration that ends the Korean war will never get on the knees of North Korea.
Washington is not willing to agree with the statement without first putting Pyongyang at the level of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism, and there is no doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would look at an arsenal that probably sees the country as his own way of guaranteeing his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris removes the latest collection huge headlines, soon to buy near you
If you want to expand your collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not seek further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a series of crazy headlines for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, an exciting set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unprofessional guards were not going to think of Instagram, and these designers have sent the catwalk on their eyelids.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant bead decorated with a fourfold wide edge that hangs over the eyes of the models.
Other superseded accessories were watermelons with precious stones, a tovenaar head and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also ignored a selection of weird masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were close to each other. They look more like Hannibal Lecter than on skin texture.
One creature looked like a duke equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a broken ice.
And if you want to follow this corrupt fashion, you're lucky.
Styllwaterers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant guards may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the streams hang with a two-metre wide edge that each carries from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The crop label behind the very unprofessional hat that was everywhere on social media also provided for another great creation on the catwalk: a strode beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathroom that the bag was carrying.
The red-haired Rafia bag, removed with ruffia francs and worked with a white lead ring, was the most striking piece in the La Rivera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the coming summer to see large shields and beach keys in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of academic excellence, and this has continued with a number of excellent exam results again in 2018, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other Community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are aimed at providing the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a scaled school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and preferred professions in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you speak to someone in a language he understands, then you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examination, we can see that languages are above the range list, with the highest percentages of success in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages had a high score.
According to data collected from 74 schools at SCIS, 72% of students received a high score in Mandarin, while 72% of students in Germany, 69% of students in France and 63% of students in Spain also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are now regarded as professional also as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and science) in independent school programmes and others.
A study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of the blockades to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are thus increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
Now more and more holidays require skill, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Despite the career that anyone has chosen, if he has learned a second language, he has in the future a real advantage with such skills for life.
Directly communicating with people from abroad provides an automatic advantage to competition for multiple persons.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to speak a conversation. France was the only language with over 10 percent exceptions, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investment in language education is now important for today's children.
More languages can be spoken, especially those of emerging economies, offering children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this area.
Shooting independent schools are involved in providing education that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and independence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his birthday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first race at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers- Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening competition before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's still to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers-reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' scheme for the six races before the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I do not need to fight before the season to prepare me for it,’ he said.
Period of election rally from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of elections
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that have been attacked by him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he has chosen for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
How late does the rally of Trump start in West Virginia tonight and how do you view online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can see Trumps rarely in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for candidate-president Brett Kavanaugh this week. These are now extra charged with sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main purpose of this series of rallys is to help the republics that are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyers were meant to "encourage volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies", so Reuters.
‘The control of Congress is so important for its programme that the president to as many states as possible is now travelling the busy campaign season,’ said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that was not to be mentioned on behalf of Reuters.
The rally tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling would be able to attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the ranks.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the prairies," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the race for Sunday's singles
After three separate sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The slinger of opportunities is a fully developed sport concept, but really real players believe in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's going to get the best chances right now?
'They had first one of six points, and now it's only four more, so we find such a little happiness right now on our side,' Jordan Spieth said before him at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing for four points while there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have scored every three points of the four.
Spieth is a very scared opponent from tea to green and he is a good example.
The typical bell sounds he made when he played well became sounder as he ran around and he made a crucial hit with which he fought four success when he and Thomas stood two points behind two matches.
His poem with which they won the competition on 15 years was followed by a similar poem, from which you can draw that he believes the American team has not been reported yet.
'You have to dig deep and take care of yourself about your own game' Spieth said.
That's all these players can still do.
18 Holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four on four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday morning, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nene on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of this series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their greedy audience, they are the players that should be reported on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will never be the most popular player who will win a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
In preference, both are at the same time in different halls.
However, it is possible to speak already of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backyard for the Spanish and Swedish that they did not come up anymore.
Today, however, there is no one who can help you get your back.
The four balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change in a blind eye.
The European team has therefore played its best and has a good start in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the United States team is ready to go to war, something that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a good start on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-days of Saturday it stands for 10-6 in the United States.
The famous Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had difficulty, so they now have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Björn, who wanted to return the trophie they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the burning Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. ordered more resistance in the foursomes, where the two contests won, but could no longer contain their behinds.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during the 12 single-day matches in order to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points on row, while he and Molinari, who received the name ‘Mollwood’ after a sensational weekend, but the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup, are the four points winning in their four open competitions.
After they had put Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played beautifully on each other and shot a disheartening Woods and American Newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 57-4.
Woods, who himself suffered on Saturday by two competitions, left behind and saw a striking sight, but he now lost 19 of his 29 competitions in four-balls and four-some and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of 'morning morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it does not take a look at Europe on this pleasant day with a crisis in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas on Saturday with three points of standard for Americans.
They won a difficult competition with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later hit Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only occurred two times in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team can have a backbone of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to match because they currently have the trophie in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, an attack seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says it's going to be 'in no case' alone without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would lead to growing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons on its own.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Meeting that North Korea had experienced 'important goodwill measures' last year, such as the halting of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of the location for nuclear tests and the promise of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘We do not see a corresponding response from the US,’ he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not let one another go.’
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's "failed" approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded with further steps, it is clear that he did not accept unilateral denuclearisation a priority, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first time between an active US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the ‘nuclearization of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first put off its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resorted to calling for the heavy international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denumeration first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a compulsory manner and even by challenging the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air disaster of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri did not report any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader had previously opened to the United Nations in the week.
The Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party were in this issue of South Korea's nuclearization and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impact.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the American mainland were directed after Mr. Evil President Trump Kim called a 'racetman' on a suicide mission.
Tripp, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, commended the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to withdraw, but said that there was still much to be done and that the sanctions should remain to denuclearize North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time schedule for this: ‘If it's two years, three or five months now, it doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council Pyongyang must pay for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and stable until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimously sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Meeting and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said there was progress, North Korea referred to him as putting 'ganterious demands'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to launch a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "compliant measures".
He said Kim had told him that the ‘coherent measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that the Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow the course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes it possible for all students to get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor noted that students of the world's largest university often have no idea of basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, established the course. For as long as he knows this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of my speech a girl came to me saying, 'Why do I get to hear this right now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important it is to sleep, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised for the first time this year, explains the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, senior psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep disorder during the week.
The course takes one hour and involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see an image of a sleeping room where they click on coffee cups, jars, practice equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance are affected by sleep failure, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants will be able to hear how long-term sleep failure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a platform of the campus, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that we will not change the students’ behavior immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the choice of cigarettes has to do with their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride at night is still there, he says, and through modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleeplessness is a growing problem.
Concerned about adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the ‘secret weapon’ of the student to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep failure makes the brain constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to establish the course. He had always studied at the university every year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course was available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a comparable study programme before they reach the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only a alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can trigger your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga target makes Gerrard's men go down
The Rangers saw their external struggle again shockingly past when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak foot beat with 1-0 in Livingstone.
Ibrox's strike was expected to take place on a first win in a battle since he hit St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's strike took care of the fall, almost the second of Gerard as manager in 18 matches. His strike is now eight points behind Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Many scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers didn't succeed in scoreing the equalizer.
The Rangers now go to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third, with only a difference in number of balls compared to Hibernia.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, as border justice Calum Spence had to be dealt with for a major wound after apparently being awarded an object to him by the visitors' supporters.
Gerard made eight changes through his crew. They took Ayr over and went to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
He remained at the same age for Livingston, who knew about the Hearts a point last week. He would have been up on how he was well-trained to block the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have had most of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They had already had to score after two minutes, when Menga spent the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the middle field couldn't finish it.
A deep-free trap from Keaghan Jacobs reached the recipient Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow jumped against the back pal.
The Rangers managed to take control, but instead they seemed to hope for a better run than they really believed if they could reach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he was entitled to a criminal trial when he and Steven Lawless were beaten after a quarter, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the request of the Colombians.
The Rangers could only shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly a target at the Ibrox, was able to stand the headball of Lassana Coulibary and Ovie Ejaria's tamme with ease.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not, however, sit in the length of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
The Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who took the ball with pleasure in the end.
Gerard took care of a break with the Coulibally/Ryan Kent switch. This set had almost immediate consequences when the flight player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racet out of his line to hold the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston loves to play, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long ball.
Holt's team could have increased its roots in the last phase of the competition, but McGregor remained well standing and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invasive Glenn Middleton of the Rangers called at the end of the competition for a penalty shop after receiving Jacobs, but Thomson looked at the other side again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigereller
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom you can well tell... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the generator.
The leader is not from science since then, and in pop culture he also became an icon, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the name of God?"
Rogers: ‘This is a generator. It is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this main phone, you will hear the effect of the atoms released by radio activity in the minerals.'
Evans: 'It's really on the knees now!'
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.

Vaccin teaches immune system to recognize harmful cells during treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They may then be given an egg ‘see’ which is often present in many types of cancer and then re-injected
A test vaccine produces many promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells saw her liver cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes the immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the ovite HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer. The cells are then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "From our results it appears that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘Stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, long cancer and breast cancer, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to pack cancer cells was rather active in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West shuts down pro-Turp-tirade and pulls MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't happen as he hoped.
Kanye West was excommunicated during a Saturday Night Live mission following an inconsistencies in which he presented US President Donald Trump and said he would become presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third night number, Ghost Town, with his head a pout with the text Make America Great Again, he broke down a tyrant against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Look, when I talk to a white person, she asks, ‘How can you now have compassion for Trump? He is a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been away from America for a long time, he said.
The mission of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood Sister Matt Damon took the lead in the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Commission for Justice in connection with the alleged encounter of Christine Blasey Ford.
West's thirade was not sent out, but funny Chris Rock was uploading it on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock and his post want to stick with West.
West also complained against the public that he had taken backstage under fire for his pet.
‘They have forced me backstage.
They said, 'Don't stop at the podium with that pet.'
They've raped me!
And then they say I'm apathy, he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathy looks?’ He said he would attract them superman-cape, ‘that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me one that I love.'
From the audience, at least two times came a letter of invitation and the SNL castles appeared to have appeared, according to Variety. The magazine received from a present audience: ‘The whole studio was quite quiet.’
West was too guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, true ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, a few days earlier had died.
West surprised many with an execution of number I Love while he was dressed as Perrier-fly.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said the second: ‘To one of our bravest minds: BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-president Karen Hunter tweets that West was just 'normally self-sustained, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose to reward someone who is an ideology that harms my community, supports and exploits, NOT (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his 'art').
He's free to do what he wants.
So did we. She added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, 'it's been officially known as Kanye West'.
He's not the first artist who changed his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also has the name Snoop Lion and the last musical Prince has ever changed his name in a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Accused of attempting to kill after party in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The accused will appear on Monday for the police officer in Belfast.
The complaint will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington comes from toxicity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as heavy fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor comes from the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys often think they should be starring to get respect when they see such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he thinks he's something wrong and asked himself how the problem of toxicity should be addressed during #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his Co-Star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is 31, said he was strongly convinced that the problem must be addressed.
'This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where is it going with our masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned from men when they grew up, and why are we now confronted with this problem?'
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxicity by its very male characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is raised up?"
What is being done on TV and on the street so young people think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the next summer series is over, because he is ‘ready with fields and horses’.
Since November, Kit has been playing with a real West Revival of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is the winner.
The actor recently questioned that he finds his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the series, so I've had my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 82 000 people have been infected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed through sex, which was not so before.
In the past Hiv has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who run this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said during a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has become widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by inadequate protection against sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and leads to 'hazardous lies' and 'computer theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters is against the allegations that one of her literary staff has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republic senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles argues that the charges are spread by ‘external rights’ contestants and websites.
‘ Lies, lies and more fun lies,’ said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Commission on sexual harassment charges at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The game came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the mail was connected to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This baseless charge is completely false and a flickering lie," said Waters.
‘My associate, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was not responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless charge is completely false and a flickering lie.'
The statement of Waters has already supported flight to critical online, including by former press associate of the White House Ari Flescher.
'This denial sounds bad,' wrote Flescher.
‘From this you can explain that she does not have the temperature to be Congress.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be bad.
He doesn't have to get up.
He should not question the complainant's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.'
Flescher appears to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive wickedness during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take the place of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
'Exactly, if it's true' he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office had raised the relevant services and law enforcement authorities to these false charges.
'We will ensure that the fathers are known' she said, 'and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In each new film with a British inscription, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that seems to be true to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comical action movies with a sleepy spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was called back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satere about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetence Johnny English with exciting eyes and flexible faces will in any case be able to send everything in the hundreds, also with his second comeback. You can already conclude from his name that he is a general comical character that was considered for bioscopic passengers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He's certainly the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange response to glade glamour, a little Closeau, a flight Mr. Bean and a little bit of that guy who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He was originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson had ever played in Barclaycard's TV spots (for whom everyone was forgotten) that always left a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it beautiful how Johnny English draws a helicopter into his medieval weaponry and the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much he has talents for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and quite overbearing, especially now the "serious" film series as 007 and Mission Impossible comedy itself as an ingredient, and do well.
Rather, the humor seems to be meant for children than for adults, and Johnny English's slow disaster comes to me less original and focused on the jokes without texting the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is going through major difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the supersecret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain, to the great disappointment of the agent in office, an amazing little role of Kevin Eldon.
That's what the mayor is doing to get over the first minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and very unpopulated as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this character that thinks of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information adviser, she must install a retired spy as each active spy has been compromised.
And that means the current Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a chique institution, but is officially teaching undercover. Here are beautiful jokes in the story, because the English-readers think about school or Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for emergency and restored with its former mobile help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a subsidiary, an amazing and jubilant role that lies below the level of Vicki Pepperdines.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody wife fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fortunate for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: Sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of clumsy dolls fun: dressed as uppers they close an eye French restaurant in fire, they create dominion on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English refuses pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself confident with the interior of Volta's house.
To that end, all registers are withdrawn, but as well as well as well intended and unhindered the scene, they do what they think about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like Johnny English's other films, I ask myself: can the British film sector really not think of any role that will bring honor to Rowan Atkinson's talent?
The Labour Party rejects the idea that the party is planning to work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan for Britain to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
According to the party, it would like to allow companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day's vacation.
This is how workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to maintain the balance of the country is in the direction of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has already been approved by the Association of Vaccines, which is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at one time, but a four-day work week is a goal that is appropriate in the effort of the party to increase the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers and also in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, since the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day work week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'visual administrators' and 'profeitors' at business.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour Government could apply 'shortcuts' on the basis of observed fraud.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in business management councils and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Including Owning Funds) with 10 per cent of the shares of companies from the private sector to employees that can be earned up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI research to Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a definitive vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that the Republican senators have their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley addressed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open here than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, beyond doubt."
However, Graham's voice seems to stand firm.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is established and the charge should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied the power," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday in New York is organised by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will take place and a truly impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come for the Global Citizen Festival to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Contestants who wanted a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a number of tasks, or 'actions' such as volunteer work, a world leader e-mail, a phone call or another significant way to generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve it?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand an invitation to action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', people feel they're making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, which have been aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the involvement of world leaders and made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion, which must change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
In early 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion was paid or brought together by sponsors.
The group estimates that the funds received thus far had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The most important intentional statements from The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom are to 'help children realize their full potential'. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end education in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the many asked questions on the Global Cities website where it was asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, "It will be a long and hard way for us to fall down and fall down.
But just like civil rights and anti-parity movements before us, we will finally succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the artists that will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can set up the sea for a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' take its flight to the sea to avoid Russian energy coming on the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to combat this.
"The United States has this opportunity, with the sea, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
A few words for welcome at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit score that itself appears as the 'vote of energy consumption' in the U.S.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these are not really different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less or more to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a 'art' country, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia with a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For these reasons, government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to turn its attention away from the 'inadequate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prison'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only directed for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the idea that energy cannot be used to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the American Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has excluded a response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI), the visible industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US to refrain from seeking EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third chance is struggling with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about taking part in the presidential elections in 2020,' says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was "serious about thinking" to participate in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said according to the political news paper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about making me the president. "
Warren runs out against President Donald Trump at the city hall and says he "sends the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so disappointed at the boat what Donald Trump's bringing into our democracy," she said.
Warren was open-ended in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said, "Of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on it."
However, from an opinion study published on Thursday, a majority of Warren's own contribution was found not to be selective in 2020.
Twenty-five percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator did not have to be selective, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Twenty-eight percent of them were available to make themselves selective.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other names of former Democrats involved in a possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
He said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS during a selection meeting by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with reporting domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to do, which he now joins him back, I have understood for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers have experienced," she told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and become stronger, they come back and ask if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police chief in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. by refusing asylum for victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have made a statement last Friday as 'friend-van-het-hof' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who supports this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace case versus Sessions which the American Civil Liberties Union had committed in August was not known.
She says her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but American officials have rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was appointed to it in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are from whom asylum applications are sought in the United States, as countries that are aware of major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has withdrawn a decision from the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014, allowing for immigrants without documents running for domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Prosecutor General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "rejects state, federal and international legislation for thirty years".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a restriction is contrary to that principle" is set out in a statement by the 'friend-of-the-court'.
Lawyers further argue that the policy that denies the access to the U.S. to immigrants is damaging the US economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'preservation of the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, has ordered in June judges no more asylum access to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asyel is available for those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion" So Sessions in their announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to solve all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get around the world every day.
Vulnerable rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma, while trying to comfort her short baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new seems in ambulances.
And clean water is cut."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses and searched their overnight possessions for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have collapsed slowly and hospitals are overcrowded, so that they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris who has undergone a broken back and shoulder, rest outside the hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of serious injuries.
tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'intimidation' with 'propagandist'
A week after an official Chinese news paper posted an announcement of four pages in an American newspaper, where the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were presented, the US ambassador in China Beijing accused the use of the US press of spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to the annex paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
Trump's complaint that Beijing tried to try with the U.S. elections, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a scaling campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a scaling trade war, where they have raised import prices.
China's compensation efforts early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as said by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had met American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "it now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of opinion and free press, a long-cost tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find quite different voices in the centre of Beijing at a keoske and will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have on the difficult economic road, since the media is standing under the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "the most prominent newspaper of China has refused to publish its article," if he did not say what newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republic's women's electoral election was just for the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now many important republics around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the High Court, and defend him against various allegations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will experience a relapse, particularly among women, during the upcoming inter-term elections.
The emotions about this issue have been enormously aroused, and most Republics have already announced that they want to go with the vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that has appeared today.
Reeher said he wondered whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to make a last-minute FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget the morning and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and local spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday, demonstrators called "November" during their demonstration in the heart of the Senate while the Republics that controlled the Justice Commission chose to vote well on the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will achieve a high record," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can still go on, especially among women in the outlying areas and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they are not in agreement with the President."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her allegations of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the High Court, it was suggested that analysts might follow a backlog if the Republics were to press charges.
"This has become a crazy hope for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only for the vote in the committee or for the final vote or for Kavanaugh to be taken in court, but also for the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of US Priorities, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, where a small majority stands for the last one.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in Ford's testimony, and 35% believe in Kavanaugh as a sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the submission of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford stated last week to the Senate Justice Commission under the age of 17 that Kavanaugh had taken her under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the High Court has shown her genitalia during a party that they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The developer of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to recompose with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technological project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world management' was the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the beginning.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contact persons, business lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it depends entirely on who the user has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteers programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete transformation so that all of their business models are completely on their head at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new time for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bringer of Victoria Cross from WHO I
The only spiritual man of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I is celebrated 100 years later in his place of birth.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglishi and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been part of the British military.
A monument was uncovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brillant symbolic' that the stone was suddenly cut down 100 years after the fact that his father was different for it.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battle on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very intense loss and under heavy fire of field protection and machinery".
He later sank through the fireline and led the line forward before he ran into a field protection and pulled out three members of the deck.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also put another skull after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very excited about playing a role in the paradise" and added that "the desirability of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you're getting the most important moment not to see.
On the note from San Jose, 13 fighters were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just at the moment Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, observers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter turned over to Peppa Pig.
Some were confused because they were awake all night long for this fight.
One of them described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with the government's rules, after 6:00 a.m. in the morning no content is to be shown which is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to be sent.
"Peppa's dog," yesss.
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said that they will adapt their programming to ensure that observers in the United Kingdom also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working.
When I made the overcrowding, there were lots of text messages coming up and again and believing me, they weren't all kind of friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case. It was a government problem.
I can promise this will never happen again.
We limit the shipments to five nights instead of six, as we usually did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went away.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'lower' because of his sexual virtue
The Olympic Cleaner Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual character, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 40-year-old said that until he went to further education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that parenting had contributed to his lower value of winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular representative of the ongoing show has been released for a few months due to illness.
Apparently as a trade on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt 'less' than others during his youth because it was 'socially unacceptable to find both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, the feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone' so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally got behind him.
The winner of two source Olympic medals became an outstanding campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Best Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The third World Championship said that the fact that he was loved by a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley was married last year to the Oscarwinnar, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the difference in life was never a problem.
"When you're so young to survive," he participated in his first Olympic Games at age four and his father died of cancer three years later, it's difficult to find someone in your own age group who has accompanied the same high and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it out of my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand firmly when he stopped breathing and not until his spirits actually collapsed and he died, I could finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won a prize.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life. To show for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musician, Proud by Heather Small, who had hit him heavily on the way to the games and where he still got kappenvel from.
Desert Island Discs is to listen to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th race in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to see his form back in order not to make any sad endings.
Mickelson, who participated for the 12th time in the two-year event, was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk's team for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors shares the day between supporting his teammates and exercising the driving range in an effort to track it down.
Since he was not even known for his right drivers at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close railways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering ball routine.
And if the job is not out enough for itself yet, Mickelson will come on Sunday in the ninth match to win all four matches this week at the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which he is linked to newling Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who stand behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start up, the match of Mikkelson can be absolutely crucial.
Fear has made it appear to have confidence in this man, although he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stick on my back, shot his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He's been in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams, in the past but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had more to expect, but it's like it is and it's the way we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played by Ryder Cup.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully attained the heights of his personal career.
Mikkelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain undesirable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's hot, he likes to take jokes out with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the young players found it fun to drop him off and then also hold him for the fool last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than his game."
Thomas Björn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can soon be lost
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable start in front of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen took the lead in the competition in Valderama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the final line passed with the smallest possible margin: 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You keep in mind that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we live, but not," said Bjorn, removed here, after he had seen the 2018 light with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone's gonna have to get in full tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan.
It's not over the points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's this trophie win, and we need to keep focusing on it.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Happy about the performances of his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never progress in this area.
Tomorrow's waiting for a new challenge.
In the morning the individual performances come to order, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he should get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, is expected to make his players individually better than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Very much itself has experienced both sides of this kind of turn on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain in 1999, had set up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the wedding tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medinah.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have agreed on our line-up and send the men on the way in order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high head tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the opposite and putting Rory McIllroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the shooting.
"I've chosen this group in this order, because I think we've been so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The new German warship re-exploited
The latest German Navy cargo would have to be in service in 2014, replacing the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to lost systems and emerging costs, reported local media.
The introduction of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the new Blue Baden-Wuerttemberg class, is now issued until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Time quoted by a military dictionary.
The vessel would have to be part of the sea in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have led to the fall of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the sea in 2007 must replace the old cargoes of the Bremen class.
For as long as we know they have a strong cannon, a number of airship and antiship rockets and a form of steel technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest issues back to two years, away from home.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to design its power over the sea, are old by the time they are taken into business, notes Die Time.
Last year, the emergency cargo F125 was all over the news, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marine sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put in a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 sails, half the manpower on the cargoes of the old Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweight, which would reduce performance and limit the possibilities of the sea to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class that were introduced by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the whole project, including crew training, is still a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousand-week € 3.1 billion, compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest issues in their grip are extremely important because of the recent warnings that the German Navy will lose its power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the sea has "a lack of introductory vessels".
The officer said that the problem of time as a snowball had been raised because old ships had been stolen from the company but no replacement ships had been delivered.
He complained that none of the requests of the Baden-Wertemberg class were available to be included in the sea.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flies
A new study carried out on land goods in the Scottish Highlands is trying to discover how to use poultry in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small pigeon, the brown turtle and the water turtle at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the country to monitor the activities of the molluscs during the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the creatures of the pellets and what they do.
A map of the habitat is then produced and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Natural Protection Advisor of the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for poultry and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of landscapes and how we can best maintain forests for wildlife and similar species.
In Scotland and the rest of the U.S. population have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that are of influence on sleeping sites and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and flashlights can also pose a risk, such as air carriers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by households.
Fly mice are not really blind.
By their nightly hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares in the country, is very serious.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate sleep sites and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the village of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
Agriculture Manager David Thompson says the good land is the ideal territory for the molluscs.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for pleen mice," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about pelagic mice that the work we do here and at other locations will help us better understand what they need to do."
He stressed the importance of control on poultry before maintenance operations are carried out, since the possible accidental destruction of a place of sleep can result in the death of 400 female chicks and their young ones, which may lead to the expulsion of a complete local population.
Birds are a protected species and it is illegal for them to kill, fall, store, or destroy their sleeping facilities.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Schots' agent for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know what it's like with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects appeals for appeal while his lawyers prepare to follow a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has qualified as 'fake news' accusations and said that people 'will themselves promote' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly Der Spiegel, where the charges have been published.
The Spice of Portugal and Juventus is charged with the appointment of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also charged with paying her $375.000 for the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the charges were reported, reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, often news," says the winner of five Golden Ballen on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling me by my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man, and by and by," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case for which they want to follow Der Spiegel for the allegations they called 'an unacceptable reporting of memories in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the footballer's room, where he had strengthened her according to the charge, as is read in the complaint filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga argues that after the alleged incident on his knees, Ronaldo has fallen and that he told her that he was a '99% good fan' for '99%', but that he is sometimes left behind as 'a percentage'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that he had some sex, but that this was mutually beneficial.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that later she agreed with an extrajudicial order because she 'was afraid of the consequences' and because she was worried about 'public degradation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because she has been traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo stood at the point of Manchester United to go to Real Madrid at the time of the joint call and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have eternal regret' as car manufacturers
The United Kingdom 'will have eternal regret' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added when it was 'sorry' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of 'non-deal Brexit' jobs would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where Auris and Aventis are produced last year, produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Britain finally broke up from the EU in March, we will see the production in our factory" said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their concerns about the consequences of an EU departure without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns involve car manufacturers about risks in supply chains in the case of a 'non-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, with every 37 minutes of delivery of supplies in the UK and in the EU for cars that are ordered.
If on 29 March the UN left the EU without a deal, there could be a discrepancies in the limits which the industry considers to be likely to lead to delays and shortcomings in shares.
Toyota cannot store stocks in the factory in Derbyshire for more than one day, so let the company know, and therefore the production would be suspended.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exactly agreed to avoid those border controls'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal that will not only enable us to continue our current success but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must definitely be able to go through with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but it was in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, who is a representative of the Union trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if these jobs have been lost once, they will never come back.
A spokesman from the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed once more, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can't be postponed for another week while the debate on the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between the assistants of Trump and Russia and possible interference with the rule of law by the President.
The question of Trump the deputy prosecutor-general is going to be dismissed and thus endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington Redemption machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to put the President down through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, they swore around that he was at the point of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he did not want to 'don' Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a week's investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the whole Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders appeared, the chief of Trump on Fox News.
Asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for this week, but it could be another week, given all the other things that are going on with the High Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press high."
Several rapporteurs had difficulties with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the most expensive press conferences were not caused by a rejection of the 'paying attention' TV journalists, although they added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then they suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is making more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, without giving evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is more than just talking to me.
We're trying to do that much and you've often seen us doing that over the past few weeks, and that'll take place at a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending public sessions or during press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the President may have demonstrated why he was making an open and, at times, strange appearance for the rapporteurs.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Ministry of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and the desire that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has indeed been prepared to declare the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU will continue, and these decisions will be taken again.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also launched preparations for a possible scenario where no deal is reached.
I know this must be some time for you all.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve NHS's activities and offer benefits to patients and communities we need.
Scotland is fixed and sure you're home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes a rapid operation after major stroke
The Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a rapid operation yesterday after he had launched a major battle against Vanderbilt Commodes, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesean.
Rod Reed, chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the wall and sat there at least one or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a straight line and mentioned him for further research.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come from the operating room to Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'there are no more details about the type/size of the lens' and Tennessee State trying to find out when the lens was located.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was arrested on Saturday in total five times before he left the field, which led him to be arrested in total 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and use their savings to help the homeless in accordance with new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the number of persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to generate £120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and use extra income to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success which attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to share this with many servers.
The increase in the law is applied to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, where extra income is withheld in an effort by the government to combat illiteracy.
The addition to the current lesson, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for two houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to raise to £ 120 million per year in this way.
According to estimates, 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. As a result, prices are rising and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the tenant.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had worked for a lower school to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to create quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'household damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of household repairs, including rental ceilings and an end to the "without loyalty" exhibition.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as the first minister to rehabilitate the British Dream, making life better for every new generation.
And that means that our failed housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always open for people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream has never become a house that has become too empty and the degradation of life without a roof over the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "final ambition" to ever be manager of Scotland.
The Shot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeastern part of England, currently in the third place in League One, at three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium or Light last summer after he had returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team and with it was the choice of "Ross told Sports Sound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw with my father Scotland playing often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps me attracted.
But that option would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The presidents of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, rather he had refused to advance from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me is now measured by 'can I let this club go back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and the facilities at this club, this must undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years behind his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the training group of Hearts.
Then he helped Allaa recover from graduation to the third division and transformed St. Mirren from the edge of graduation to the winning of the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a cross point," he recalled from the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird because I've done the best I can, I've been quite well deserved and I've known some reasonable high points.
But football can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, undressed study
The heat golf in the summer has increased incomes from British pubs who are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, let's see the figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA's business consultant, who collected the figures, said: "In the course of the solar eclipse and the fact that England is expected to participate in the world's championships, meaning that July has seen a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8% more, unlike the fact that the restaurants were now being hit harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the processing of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that were focused on drinking sales made out of the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on the sale of food also belong to the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It looks like people are just on the outside to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the free-time and host-free sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The return and impact of important social or sports events remains the main factors for the market in the emerging market.
It is not surprising, then, that restaurants continue to fight, although it is a 4.8 per cent-year-on-year shift in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, cold summer could not have come at a bad time for operators who are not on their way to food and only the time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give them such a necessary response."
The total turnover in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decrease from the introduction of new brands.
In the Caffer Peach Tracker, the VK's market monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector, the performance data is collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep secret for their parents.
One of the five children, not more than 11 years of age alone, has a secret account for social media, that they keep secret for parents and teachers, unsuspecting an investigation
Inquiry among 20,000 students from secondary schools excluded growth in 'false Insta-pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents.
One of the five children, not more than 11 years of age alone, makes accounts for social media that they hide for adults.
An survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' to show their parents while they still have personal accounts.
A mother who came right to her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found out there a teenager who asked others to 'strengthen her'.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and HeadMistles" Conference) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and that half contributed to maintaining personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's amazing that so many teenagers are dedicated to creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilyh Doyle will be the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eiilh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletic World, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and in the field and president Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eileh enjoys a great deal of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its choice in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to vote for the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help the sport run in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now gives regular comments on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will tell me if I will recover and to what extent.
It's been really hard work, but I'm completely restored now, I've been learning again and doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support certificates!"
Advertising for breast pumps in which mothers are compared with dogs, distribute online opinion
A company making breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which such mothers are compared to cows that are breast-feeding.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quietly portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a producer of consumer technology, issued an Iranian, inspired announcement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump offers to cool mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full-fledged bowl on a song containing texts such as: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can see nothing' and 'In case you didn't have it in the gates, these are no eggs, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then goes on: 'Pamps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.'
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has resulted in hundreds of comments, especially combined reactions by viewers, where many people say that the 'horror' of the olive industry is balanced here.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the abortion" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding baby (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "It's of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But why don't we use them to warn mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This announcement is so far from reality."
Others defended the announcement and allowed a woman to find the song 'Hilary'.
"I find this a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breast feeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked too much.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "It's a funny announcement, focusing on moms who swim (often at work or in a toilet) and then it just feels like they're 'chokes'.
This ad does not seem to be positive or negative about the olive industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hide in their bees.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who swallow feel very little dogs at times.
The Elvie Pump is completely quiet, however, has no ropes or snakes and fit discrepancy in a feeding pool, so that women have the freedom to move, to hold their babies firmly and even go out while they're on their knees.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is a rather revolutionary product that deserves a storage and provocative introduction.
By comparing collating mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the coal and associated challenges in the miners and at the same time show how the new pump for an incredible feeling of freedom will go.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on Martha Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants are slowly moving to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of target migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strong rhetoric and the strict policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children into sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they are afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country by registering for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Congress that his organization had arrested dozens of people who had reported themselves as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70 per cent of the hostages had no previous criminal record.
"Bijn 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in this country and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are following these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, whereby some of them are obliged within one month after the start of the detention, to appear before the court, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the employees at the Shelter.
Many of them will be present at a video conference for the Court of Justice, instead of in person, to order their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance of their becoming anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or flight attempts, according to the workshop staff and reports from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a greater facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more often ignored, due to the extent of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say anything to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them have already faced.
Syria orders the US's 'intention power', France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moulalem, also vice-president, said that the foreign troops are illegally on the Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be treated accordingly'.
"They must return immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moulalem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been homeless and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy war until we have freed all Syrian areas" from terrorist groups and from a "probably illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly with the training and advice of the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-affected country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for their return and he refused to ‘several Western countries to spread irradiational concerns’, which kept most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politifying a case that should be only a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid is available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important bollocking of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The dispute between Russia and Turkey has resulted in a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moulalem stressed, however, that this agreement was known as 'clear deadlines' and he hoped that the military action would be directed against Jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda.
Staffan the Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to bring together the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for the post-war war for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what are the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the Commission and said that the work of the panel should be limited to 'to review the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against mixing outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would rather win the elections in 2020 than, as many 'liberal' observers would probably hope, his presidency would be terminated in the future by a replacement procedure and scandals.
There is no doubt that 'the most dramatic end of a Presidency would ever be'.
At this point, however, there are no signs of blindness.
Since 2014, the ‘primary-time’ watch figures in CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly doubled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' from MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire attracting people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" a series of ministers who will be president after an attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
It recalls a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said 'because he made me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike all the other TV shows, the stories coming from Washington can affect, determine, or influence, Roe v. Wade's future or whether immigrant families can be re-introduced or influenced by the state of the world economy.
Shutting off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going to be more than an informed citizen when you get into the streets that you've been sitting for six hours looking at a panel of experts who discuss the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which has it about the jack of Paul Manafort's cotton teacher who has spent $15,000 (a piece of clothes full of surprise' according to The Washington Post) and those discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's going to be a reality show is partly that he's stopping you every night something new," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wellhouse Entertainment and the founder of 'Pown Stars', about the rotating role-sharing of the Trump show and the daily shifts (a fight with N.F.L., Kim Young and praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're walking behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he opened CNN.
He could not get out of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the High Court at the game.
"I remember that we had all those rare shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'it's the beginning of the end of the Western Creation'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it looks like they were right."

Money outside flows in the most exciting inter-time elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district has seen a flow of money, thanks to a resurgence of a electoral district where two people sitting are fighting for the same seat.
The newly relocated district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election late.
Lamb must be taken up against another people's representative, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-shared after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were illegally distributed (the 'remandation') for the benefit of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout party in the field of campaign financing between the financial stocks of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-known special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican and President Donald Trump for more than ten years.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considers El Salvador to be punished for its support to China and has considered it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners set up the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on 'the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the Minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received US $140 million in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic well-being as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, by September some of the officials from the government knew that they wanted the conference to go through, making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for half-October, as a sign of the importance of the government attending the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. agents have been returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without strong reports of Washington's criminal action.
A speaker from the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate under anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also speaks on the basis of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible enforcement of justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller's investigation is probably also aimed at co-operation between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress has changed its color, Trump must take responsibility for that institution, just as he is willing to return to the voters, and perhaps he must be responsible for a jury in a court.
That is a mixed hope, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or those of its equivalents in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will determine how long the war will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a 'cop d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had ordered opposition and Czech-Slovakia had supported them in Munich.
We lost and lost an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of concern and the uncompromising pace of democracy is thus accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with different kinds of divergences.
What will we do if Trump's deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the lead in Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the moment this paper reported that he had suggested that he should speak to the President in secret last year and that he had speculated on the appropriateness of the President's office.
Rosenstein says the report of The Times doesn't work.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation requested to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if it is referred to in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of appeal and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call for Trump to respond?
If we fall into these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fall by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once owned my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to pick up cards for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is represented.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rankers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory for the Austrians after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal this month will place them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
The middle fielder Graham Dorrrans was unable to play his first race from the season to the 2-2 game at Villarreal, but he believed that the Rangers could use the results as a platform for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good elephant," said the 31st-year-old.
"We went to the game with the idea that there was much to win and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end, but the whole game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we got out in the second half we were better off.
The next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight because they also had a good outcome in their final fight. But if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can press and we can get a positive result.
Last year it must have been hard, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feeling factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now print, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because they're worried about their pensions
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps necessary to make this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you are going to get care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial adviser into stock: Your advisor can also give you advice on how you can pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash to help cover these expenses, or establish your own capacity as insurance as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal conflict when insurance is required.
Take care of full health care, so that you can identify a trusted person who can take care of your medical care and make sure that the professionals will be able to communicate your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the power of your financial business.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies in that case?
Set these details in a written plan so that you have the information available.
"It's not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are being used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes."
Several times you were shot with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure when he walked home after an accident.
The victim, forty plus, was found in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, neck and hand.
Agents describe the strike, which took place about 02:30 BST, as a 'willing action'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and it is expected that the death rate will continue to rise.
The authorities have not yet received information from the Doghea government, a region north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the fortress with a force of 7.5 on the scale of the Richter.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Doghea, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was 40th year old when the tsunami hit.
Dothraa is a kingdom that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just under one province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the most important activities in the economy of the Province of Midden-Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Dothria.
Nickelmines are also important in the province, but they are for most of Morowali on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Doghea have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Anti-Fraud Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
A tsunami also struck the west of Doghea in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided for a tsunami which hit 14 countries and claimed total 26,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, for the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most closely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that contributed to the south coast and claimed almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found the death.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 on Richter's scale struck one of the Mintawai islands, at the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A sudden earthquake struck the state of Pidi in Atjeh and the destruction and panic caused by the earthquake, as people were reminded of the destructions of the deaths of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami following this time but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist country Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for most of the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made it possible for thousands of tourists to be on time.
Old son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering resistance during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman known tried to call the police to report the alleged seizures, she took off her phone.
Palin is kept in custody in the storage house Mat-Su with a burrow of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly aware' when he was asked to do so, reported the network.
Palin is charged with three offences of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a maximum of $250,000.
He is also charged with a breach of class B, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was charged with the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves as the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in relation to the incident.
His friend claimed he had shot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veterinary group, after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which would have prevented him from serving in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: one hundred deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disabled while it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The settlement was located just near the centre of Celebes, located in the northeastern part of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare punishment which has not been implemented since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the complaint, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was already on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Sajpov 'finally' has killed the eight victims and 'finally' has committed serious physical injuries, according to the intentional statement in which the death penalty is required, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both complaints, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted by the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal high court approved the charge with 22 complaints, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typical complaints used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the complainants and they describe the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'grandsome, cruel and destructive'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused harm, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," says the intentional statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that a case arose in the Southern District of New York where the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both justified by the power plant on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, did not provide evidence of origin within the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know that he felt good about what he did, she was the police.
Siapov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the commission after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also asked the police to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital.
He did not claim to be responsible for the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of a confession of guilt in place of a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
The defence of Sajpov had previously asked the complainants not to require the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARGE should guide Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize more people" during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians must 'feel hot' of the Eurosceptic, while one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed that he be guided by negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at March in Birmingham that the VK 'would have been out' as Mr Farage Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge posed by May in disbursing the heavily distributed past is highlighted by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep her Chequers compromise on track while this is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Contestants were satisfied that they would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the opposition, and so Eurosceptici and Labor had to choose between her package and 'choos'.
Bone said at a convention of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Checkers in the man of the pulverity'.
He suggested that Farage should be treated and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the service, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chechers into the dustman."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be enough.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It is good to suggest that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Primer, listen to people.
Chechers is unpopulated with the large audience, the opposition does not go ahead for votes, it is unpopulated within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chechers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, they added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that policyci should "feel hit" if they decided to sell the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "We don't let you go here."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to fire our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We will mobilize the people of this country that we have won in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists tired with flags on Tories Against Brexit, after the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, made comments on the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can take care of IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the free movement border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a perfect color.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'good to think' about candidate for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be 'good to think about her candidate for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the democracy from Massachusetts told about its future at a meeting in a city hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wanted to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican who was co-chair of the campaign of Trum in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the midpoint of speculation that she might be going to war with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday morning in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a city hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our weak government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after death of Wade Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the murder of Wade Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free of the incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade took steps forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has been known to be present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per competition.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has given him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that a team of Mercedes' orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and allowed Hamilton to stand almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel urged his teammate to attack him.
Vettel went into the pits and put Hamilton in the pressed wheels at the start of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went around the pits later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on his head after a wheel-up action, which led to the Ferrari driver’s release from the inside after a double movement in the third box.
Max Hide started the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st anniversary.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he remained at his band choice and was busy at fast finish, so that he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally he went in the 44th round to the pits, where he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that the Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri's been doing his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team has done its best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body steel.
President Donald Trump commissioned Senator Diane Feinstein during a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she did not fully be the source of Christine Blasey Ford's beautiful letter, in which the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of having an appeal.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President had not directly heard of the testimony given by Ford for the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he showed that what happened in the Senate could be 'common, unfair and unfair'".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry, angry and united and dishonest and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the Persians and the legends and then they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.'
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, are you okay?
You still know her answer... you cleared the document--'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't like it.'
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't.
In July the letter in which the charges at the address of Kavanaugh were sent to Feinstein was sent by Ford and this was released in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was ill.
"I didn't hide Dr. Fords' accusations, I didn't read her story," said Feinstein to the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with her and I treated her as she asked."
But the President refused to believe her resignation and made a comment at the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body chair.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body steel I've ever seen."
In his defense of the candidate for the High Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the ignorance, they don't give anything to whom they are suffering, who they must drive to take power and get back control" the President would have said according to a Mediate report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return competition with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the camp near, before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equation for Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals assured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make a stand on Friday night to then beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two platoons met together, where the Giants won the previous three competitions.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with Beauvillier doubled the original, four minutes later.
During a printed opening period, Sullivan returned the play at 13:10, before Matt Marquartt gave the presentation to Cownie's equivalent maker at 15:16.
He was evidently concerned that the Giants, with a priority, wanted the first rest, when he made his second round of the night at the end of the first period.
The home play repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a state of equal size with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen for the first time to bring Dundee into the competition, leaving him in the second period. He managed to win with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games now, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while he ensures that hundreds of earth’s inhabitants can escape in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after his death because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could safely board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been killed after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that caused a tsunami.
Powerful nears still haunt the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agun refused to leave his post in the wild again and again moving traffic routes from Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the time ready for launch, could rise safely.
Then he was kicked out of the traffic towers when he thought they were on landfills.
He died in the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter arranged by Balikpan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could increase to the thousands and let the Agency know that access to the cities of Dothria, Siggi and Butung is limited.
"I believe that the death rate is still rising because many bodies are under the pain and have not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where on Sunday a mass funeral will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought into the body by ambulances.
Clean water is clear.
The minimarkets are all splendoured."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but don't know what they're going to do.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widododo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and said to the present military: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation will be completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people lived.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lake
The airline that carried out the flight that was crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that another man will be lost after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press report that one male passenger is missing on Saturday morning.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the questions for more details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane was hit by water during landing on the Chuke Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for a while.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the aircraft has landed in the lakes and the countryside.
Some witnesses believe that the plane over the landing route has been shot.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he himself and some others had been hit by the water, which came through them, to turn to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the guards were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that a sailor who was close to work on a well has also helped in rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with an explosive boat before the plane further sinks in about 30 metres deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have been killed in crashs of airlines registered at PNG but that has nothing to do with Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the time line of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The complainant was released on Friday in the open-ended process of a man charged with burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave an hour's witness as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she left her life.
Rowlett told that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was in conflict with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis spoke the truth when he told Sanford that he was in his truck during that night, Sanford said he was 'laugh because my truck was then in Nashville'.
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other for just one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the SMS, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from her life," said Hale.
The defense begins Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the consultation later that day.
The High Width: What is 'conscious hipop'?
A hypoptrio wants to put the negative image of the genre into discussion by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol points out that hipop has been fascinated by the origin of political opinions and the appeal of social problems.
They want to return to the root and 'conscious hip' to make it popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently had an experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York girl makes a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A young woman from New York makes a married couple to the judge for reasons of refusal for discriminatory reasons after she received a misapplied text in which the mother complained about 'again and again'.
The couple refuse to be racist and call the case 'absorption'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she found out that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, had become a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEE WOE' AND ZWARTE,' wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, Mrs Maurice, who felt 'hard', when she realized that she was looking forward to seeing her baby girl, who was an Afro-American, had given up a bad job, and that is why she had expected a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was later sent home with a taxi.
Maurice now makes the right to receive a compensation of $350 a day for the six months for which she was hired to take care of the family, although without a contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do it,' Maurice said last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple abstained from the claim that they were racist by saying that it was reasonable to avoid Maurice after they were afraid that she could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, married Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
But would you leave your children to someone who hurt you, even though it was an accident?
Your adoptive baby?
I don't think so.'
In comparison with 'absorption', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby over two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.
Did you follow someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic, the investment bank added.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion is quick to capitalize on social media, where it is condemned for their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking beer, unhesitatingly newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very easy.'
She told her father, who, before being inspired to write the book about a little toys beer, when a cameraman worked at the British ambassador BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'Bittersoet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, angry man."
'But since Paddington was so alive for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for yourself.
I think he's been so successful about Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he used the beer himself for success.'
My daughter was dying, and I had to tell her through the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
'Nothing had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected they wouldn't get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'When Nad's phone came to say they'd be dead in two minutes and I had to get rid of her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped slowly worked and lost her body.
She was dead some time ago, and this process went on.
I could just stay there, know what's going on.
I couldn't be sad, crying or crying because I was between many people and families.
I really needed to be big.'
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now crying about the death of her daughter, flew into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test they had to pass.
"No one knew it," she said.
'I sat down with my head down and the tears just came.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.'
Roofing women post reports on need to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their lives through suicide are strong enough to keep others alive.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was first depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
'I don't want any parents to feel the same way I feel every day,' she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, England's Gloucestershire County, says her son was a promising chef with an impressive edge.
'He was famous for his smile.
He always said his smile lighted every room.'
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deeply in the pit."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he robbed himself of his life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I'm constantly making sure there's a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, though it's just a friend.
Don't be weak - talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt somber or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christ, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was totally on the ground on First Christmas - when the children picked up their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or so.'
She said that her death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to process it: 'The whole family disappeared from each other.
It drives us out.
But we all have to go on and fight.'

Brett Kavanaughs is uncertain about the future while the FBI's research starts.
'I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for; a limited study in time and scope, we might again be able to create more unity', so Mr. Flake last Saturday, which he added, he was afraid that the committee 'from each other' would fall in the middle of a rigidly shaken adjustment within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their resilience has done everything with time.
The interim elections are already over five weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to do the wrong, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to congratulate Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and his wife Ashley learned that Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI has completed its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently in session.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate and that Mike Pence, Vice-President, would offer the opportunity to vote in a certain vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the High Court.
Number of overruns in North Korea under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean survivors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Young and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Eenwording, states that there were 1.127 survivors last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park points out that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smokers are the most important factors for falling.
Pyongyang didn't react in public.
The vast majority of the survivors from North Korea are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and where you can make it easier to cover than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China instead views the survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them to violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the process of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Prior to this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, where they discussed in particular the accelerated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Young-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large lines to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress in the abolition of American sanctions.
'Without faith in the conduct of the US, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no speech of a first step of unilateral disarmament', so Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unafraid to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, appointed candidate judge for the US High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the High Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman would behave like this, but would call her 'hysterical', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaughs witness to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the allegations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited at times; he was almost nervous and was especially wide when he told about his family and his secondary school time.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the Commission, in which he called the accusations against him 'great and coordinated murder', organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaughs testified that he was not qualified to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', then Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to introduce an intervention procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'That's what I can say; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he's not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he's now serving,' Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the 'District of Columbia' (mostly reduced D.C.) District Court of Beroep.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade'. Kavanaugh is always known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions on the revision of certain decisions of the High Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be jealous if there is now a hysterical, privileged person appointed in the Supreme Court', Pelosi said.
Women should just be allowed here.
It is a fair tyrant of months and years of heated anger that passes, and they can only cry out to get it out.
'We're gonna cry if we're angry,' said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I have been greatly helped by a woman who was leading some way and who told me that she also went crying when she was upset. She developed a method, where she was still angry.
I'm angry.'
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant.'
tears are partially allowed as an expression of anger, because tears are really misunderstood.
One of my best memories of an earlier job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry terriblely because I was upset. An older woman, a guy's manager where everyone was a little scared, grabbed me in my neck and knocked me into a wooden house.
'Never let her see that you're crying,' she said to me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you on the box.
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart had developed into an external affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catkin chain' or 'openline') and withdrew from the race, thinking that Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not apply for herself.
'It wasn't a courageous decision,' she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone had it about 'Snew White and the seven holes'.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fundraising, so she promised not to do it if she couldn't afford $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
'Do they think I'll get a discount?' she asked herself.
When she held her talk in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of taking it off, and of anger about sexism - that she was in touch.
'I'll have thought I got a news report,' recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media responded to her.
They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I still remember thinking what they were gonna put on my gravestone?
"What's going on?"
How the trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The opening-up of the trade war between the US and China was overwhelming, and although the war has not been fought long enough, a gap between the two countries would, according to experts in the long term, be favourable to Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unabated for $200 billion (EUR (150 billion) on goods; half of all goods coming from China from the US.
Peking has taken in natural repressives every time, most recently by raising prices from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars to US goods.
China has promised to match the U.S. every time, and the world will probably not be fast with the eyes.
In order to allow Washington to dive, it is necessary to request consent, but public bid for the US is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that, as Peking plays the game, the trade war with the US, China, could be a long-term positive support by reducing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
'The fact that a fast political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, whereby one of the two countries could come to an economic fall, is actually much more dangerous than observers have recognized before', so Abigail Grace, a research associate of the 'Center for a New American Security', is an idea specialized in national security issues aimed at Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, so Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mouelem, said that the situation in his country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government is responsible for rehabilitating areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and for normalising the situation.
All the circumstances now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that they have been living and threatened every day.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war started in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the country of destruction.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries which had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the "2018 Ryder Cup" by the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the "Le Golf National" golf course in southern Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish carrier team Thomas Björn won the number of 14.5 points needed to hit the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mikkelson, who was almost the entire tournament, let his long shot from the tea in the water landed at par 3, Hole 16, and caused his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shot in all its rounds and became one of the four players who had ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was fired by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-class player on the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 Holes down and 1 Hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which could be the last race in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, was the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I'm not crying so fast, but today I can't do anything.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the bucket back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help, said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the case to his countrymen, John Ram, who went to the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods, I've always followed those guys when I grew up,' said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major champions, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the train, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The American actor, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his work: 'I am proud of these guys, they have fought.
In the short run, we have made Europe more difficult in the morning.
We're on our way.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great performer.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their provider.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're surprised.'
Red glass update: Concentrations take place in the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in the concentrations of Red ice in parts of Tampa Bay Area (based on the west coast of Florida in the United States).
According to the Commission, there are reports of fragmentary increases in the Red cloud in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glass extends over an average of 200 km coastal line, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee county.
There are about 16 km for the coast of Hillsborough County, but less places than last week.
There's also red glass seen in Pasco County.
There are medium-sized concentrations reported for the Pinellas County coast last week, low to high concentrations for the Hillsborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or for the Sarasota County coast, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or near the Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of air irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwestern part of Florida, no notice was made of the irritation of the airways in the past week.
