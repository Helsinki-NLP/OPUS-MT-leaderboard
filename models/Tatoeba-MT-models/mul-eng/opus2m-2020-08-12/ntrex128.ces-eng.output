Members of the Great Assembly are afraid that they will "be like Mupeti"
Some of the members of the Grand Assembly are concerned by the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – member of the Grand Parliament)
The proposal is therefore intended to change the name of the Assembly to the Great Parliament.
Members' meetings against the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause laughs.
A member for the Laborustic Party stated that his group is afraid that "it will end with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the majority of the twp means a pistomy and pwp means a hunch.
A post-Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The great conservatory stated that his group is going to change the name "with an open mind", but noted that MWP is close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the large letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation for the amendment of the name, stated: "The final decision on how members of the great assembly will be called will of course be on their own."
The Law of the Great Government of 2017 gave a great assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals where broad support was given the option of calling the Grand Parliament a meeting.
As regards the title of members of the meeting, the Commission gave priority to the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the highest support in the public debate.
The members' meetings clearly offer alternative options, but the fight for consensus can lead to the concern of President Elin Jones, who has to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
Members' meetings will vote on the issue of their title within the framework of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the "Northern Macedonian Republic".
All votes should be resolved for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
The Athenians have long argued that the name of the northern neighbour represents a fine on the Greek territory and have repeatedly protested against requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is an envoy of the Plebiscito on the change in the name, announced that he will not be led by the vote.
The representatives of the referendum, including President Zoran Zaeva, still argue that the change in the name is simply a price for access to the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin are silent because the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The old people I talked to say that he was at every street bar and church before," says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
The disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today are dealing differently," she says.
"Bars are no longer the living room where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, the money from the sale of property will not last as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people like those who do not help the remaining holy ones in the fourth.
"The simple majority of people who buy housing in these homes will be white," she says, "and therefore soon the day will come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these homes will become members of the churches."
Both churches built a white congregation even before the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin, ten years later.
The original White Collegiate Congregation was established in the 30th century.
She took over the black congregation, which was soon to end her worship.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of the Revendant John Howard Johnson, who was standing in front of a small shop on 125th Street, the main shopping mall in Harlem who refused to hire or raise the blacks.
The fire badly damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson's cousins planned his reconstruction, they also ordered sound.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor at St. Martin, called the sound hero "the voices of the poor".
The board, which played on the sound game in July, called it "the cultural record" and "the irrevocable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first sound show in the world played by the Montenegrin singer, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger sound show in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says no one hired him at St. Martin.
In the last few months, St. Martin has been playing a complicated story of architects and architects, some of whom called the healers of the church, others of Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders – the leading authority of the charity, composed of lay representatives – sent in July a letter expressing concern that the diocese "will try to handle costs" to the council of the elders, although it did not take part in the acquisition of architects and depositors who sent the diocese.
Some of the guys were complaining about the lack of transparency on the part of the diet.
Jalok was injured in California by a 13-year-old boy who fell for Humour
According to official reports, on Saturday he attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who died in California on the day of the start of the rainy season.
The attack came soon before 7 o'clock in the vicinity of the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he had already spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he sat down with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that he first considered the call to be the joy of the hummingbird, but then “he realized that he cried out ‘ Come on!
Put me down!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had a broken whole area of key bones."
“I cried out to everyone from the water: ‘In the water there is a hole!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in a critical condition by a wheelchair to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of pests are standing behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at the press conference indicated that the iron was in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of beetles in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury's plans to enter the market with cosmetics in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to be set up by the network of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized sellers will be available.
In the context of a strong move on the market with cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods will be tested in 11 markets across the country. In case of success, the next year will be extended to other sales.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for the rules used in the past for television, microwave and domestic use.
Sainsbury's notes that it doubles the size of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first mentions such signs as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be obtained by existing ordering L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to marked locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also re-enters its make-up Boutique variety, so most products will be vegan, which young customers still need.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will test the concession of retail sales of perfumes Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened in Croydon, south of London, and next year it will start in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying on the Internet and moving towards daily purchase of small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to make more effort to attract people.
Director General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says sales will become more and more like business houses, because the network of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discounted sellers, such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of shops around Argos and also set up a number of Habitat departments, which were banks that bought two years ago. As a result, food sales increased and the aquifers were even more profitable.
The previous attempt to transform the supermarket division with cosmetic and medicinal product has not been celebrated.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the issue of distribution of the proceeds from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 doctors for 125 million free company Celesio, which owns a dozen doctors Lloyds.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury signs to four sales, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our variety should satisfy all needs and loving environments and a good place to do so, meaning that we are now presenting an attractive place for the purchase of cosmetics that changes the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "distracted" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones "worse" after the television monitor Holly Willoughby retired from the contract at $11 million with its lifestyle sign so that she could focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their domestic dress and identity of Truly.
The performance of this pair was compared to the character of Goop heretic Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventy-year-old modator of the series announced his departure from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby examined the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones series by leaving their luxury lifestyle business – to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to known sources, Jones “blowed” when a television star at a busy afternoon meeting in the center of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that because of new contracts – up to 1.5 million pounds – it will no longer be able to devote enough time to their domestic clothing and membership of Truly.
He was compared to Goop's hero Gwyneth Paltrow and was able to double the wealth of the Willoughby modifier in the estimated 11 million pounds.
When seven-year-old Willoughby on the Instagram announced that Truly would leave, Jones came out of Britain to one of his annual seats.
The above source states: “Truly’s label was a major priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would guarantee her a few decades ago.
Her decision to leave all the participants were shocked.
No one could believe what's going on in the afternoon, the landing was so close.
In central Marlow there is a full stock of goods ready for sale."
Experts are of the opinion that this Morning series of modulators, which is one of the most powerful British stars, would allow the company to invest millions of dollars in the current products from posters and candles after clothes and home clothes and possible further delay in the identification of the mark.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tary Capp.
Willoughby founded the mark of Truly with Tary Capp in 2016 and twelve-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Couples go on vacation and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become Ambassador of M&S and will replace Anta McPartlina with I'm A Celebrate on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult deal "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he received from the journalists for the note that some consider to be "an improper president" and how he speaks out about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
The trumpet was answered by his funny "vote" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that after their first red meeting in Singapore Trump, he considered it a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the deal with the removal of nuclear weapons was on the dead spot.
More than three months after the Red Summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN Wall Summit on Saturday that North Korea from the United States does not see a "responsive response" on its first steps to arms.
The United States continues to do so in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
The trumpet in its exhibition expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the other side of the war with North Korea.
That would last millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led him to positive results – the end of rocket tests, help with the release of arms and return of the rest of the American soldiers to power.
And he prevented his unusual access to information about Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this messy neighborhood, we'd have about 200 people who would stay right here," Trump said and pointed to the tax before him.
The flood of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands and killing hundreds of people.
In the post-mortem situation, Lombok, a foreign non-governmental organisation, for example, learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboku were excluded from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, regret has been made very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little rather convenient," said Mrs. Sumbung.
The Organisation Save the Children Network provides a team that is traveling to Pala, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work here.
The national disaster speaking agency Mr Sutupo said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Paul to find out whether international organisations would be able to help.
In view of the fact that the earthquake occurs in Indonesia very often, the country is still not prepared for Mother Nature’s wrath.
In Acehu the network has been built against tsunamis, but in other parts of the coast it is not quite common.
He likely contributed to the loss of human life and the apparent lack of sirens warning in Paul’s case, even though warnings were issued.
Even in the best of times, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that landed in Lombok and helped the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before a new disaster occurs.
The improvement of the evil Indonesian infrastructure was the main theme of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and the president lost a lot of money for the railways and railways.
The next year he will be forced to re-examine the election, but his government suffers from financial losses.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectoral pressure in Indonesia when members of the majority of Muslims adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Halfway wars between Christians and Muslims in which gangs use swords, spears and shields and other primitive weapons have already claimed lives more than thousands of people and tens of thousands have fled their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool shot the parallel branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge took a walk in London's Stamford Bridge in 89 minutes and then saved Liverpool from the Chelsea storm in Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres before Chelsea's defense when his team lost 1-0.
He turned his sword on the truck and shot at a distant uncle.
She shot the plane high and headed to the right upper edge of the gate.
The sword finally crossed the climbing Cape of Arizabala and ended up in the network.
"I've only tried to get to the right place to get the game, and players like Shaq always play what's best before, so I wanted to get as much time as possible." Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante's approach to me, so I didn't think about it very much and shot at one touch."
Chelsea in time brought 1-0 by the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues refugee sent a passport back to Matthew Kovacic, then circled around in the middle of the game and landed at half Liverpool.
Kovacic's game is fast.
Then he sent a sword to Hazard's beautiful street into the spring.
He ran away from his weapon and ended up with a remote bitch near Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15-hour Liverpool in the League of Masters at the San Paolo Stadium in the Italian Neapolis is meeting with the local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 hours in London with Videoton in the European UEFA league.

As the Indonesian disaster agency introduced Sunday morning, the number of land-use victims and the flood tsunamis jumped to 832.
The earthquake on force 7.5 hit on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 metres high and imposed many people on the coastal buildings, said at a press conference of the Supop Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by a few well - built buildings.

Socha Cromwell in Parliament has recently become an emergency because of the "recording of history" issue.
His exemption would be deserved because his fanatic Puritan successors in the style of Taliban destroyed a number of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr Cricka's proposal "a visit" and "an effort to re-write history."
President Cromwell of the Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of tears, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s position before the Westminster Palace would be one of the objectives.
Cromwell didn't order or perform iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The beautiful creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the post that many think it is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, even though it is less than the end of the 19th century, for the protection of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this explanation is the subject of non-exhaustive historical debate.
It is true that the conflict in the 17th century has created the next development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identified institution that represents one side of this transition.
His success in the role of the protector Lord also stands for the celebration and memory."
Killing pig exposed the Chinese farmer
According to local media, it was found on the market in South-East China to attack and kill a farm pig.
As the South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man who was introduced only by the name “Yuan”, was found dead with a high fever in a blood clot near the market in Liou-pchan-shua in the province of Kuwait.
The pig driver is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in the city of Si-ing on 30 May 2005 in the Chinese province of Čching-chaj.
Apparently in the middle he came with a brother from the province of Yün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found a dead man and found out that the door to the back door was open.
According to him, there was a large vein with blood pressure in the skull.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that 250 kilograms of veto had been broken down by the farmer.
"Bratranec had his feet full of blood and clean," quoted the daily Guiyang Evening News fraternal, meaning "Wu".
The security camera record shows how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his brothers.
The manager of the market told the Evening News daily that the dog was closed so that no one else could be hit when the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Market representatives are likely to contact Yuan's family about his death.
The runaways are rare to humans, but they've come to them in the past.
In 2016 the dog attacked a woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and the husband critically injured.
About ten years ago, 300kg of pig caught a large farm belonging to the tractor and abandoned it until the farmer's wife.
After having eaten his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the smell of blood can work as a "smooth".
"They're just playing.
They're scientists... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricanes will bring to the southwestern United States heavy rain
Hurikán Rosa, according to the prophecy, is weak and is over colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
The next day, however, it will bring a flood to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning of the east time, Rosa reached wind speed 137 km/h, representing a hurricane category 1, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Between the Pacific Ocean, the bridge of low pressure is formed and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the coast of Baja California in the afternoon, she will have a view of tropical storms and start to push tropical moisture north to the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of wire on Monday.
Tropical humidity, then approaching the low-pressure bridge in the following days, will cause a possible rainfall in the southwestern United States.
Cuts 25 to 100 mm locally cause hazardous wastes, sutures and possible wastes of soil on the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause the shocks to reach between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of wires are expected.
In the case of rapid deterioration conditions, due to the different relationship of tropical rain, domestic flooding may occur.
In view of the danger of tropical storms, it would be very unreasonable to expose sand to the desert.
Heavy rain can cause cannons to become hot rivers, and storms bring local winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure bridge will bring strong local strikes on some parts of southern California.
The total cuts of more than 13 mm can be issued, which could result in lower sutinous and classical injuries.
This will be the first hits of the rain period in this region.
On Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, a single tropical crossing will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and on the afternoons the rain will spread.
In the afternoon the heavy rain spreads into four holes and will last until midsummer.
In October we can expect intensive heat changes across the United States, because Arctic will begin to relax, but in the tropical sand it will still be the whole heat.
This sometimes leads to a sudden heat change in short distances.
A great example of outstanding temperature differences is between the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahau in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowė is about 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, he tries again to increase the rising annual temperature.
In most areas in the middle and in the east of the United States, temperatures are expected to start about 27 °C from the south-east of the United States.
In New York City tomorrow it could be 27 °C, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October the high probability of excessive temperatures in the United States.
Britta Kavanaugh was followed by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people were following the fourth round of the canals of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was probably caused by him in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political pact situation continued and the voters interrupted regular programmes with reports of sudden return: an agreement reached by Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona that the FBI is conducting a one-day investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was wearing her at the high school party and trying to wear her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in his resurrected statement that he was 100% sure it wasn't.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people identified by the Nielsen agency.
The company calculated average compliance at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that sent comments such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not available immediately.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at the offices.
For comparison, it's the same number of fans who follow football matches in play-off or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose modators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest traceability of all stations when, according to the Nielsen agency, it was followed by 5.69 million fans during the whole day of the hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million fans.
Nielsen points out that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
He's been interested even after the end of the meeting.
The main stage of the fifth drama was Senator Flake.
Following the announcement by the Office of this moderate Republican that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS's cameras were arrested on Friday morning, as protestors were calling on him when he decided to proceed to the hearing of the Court.
CNN passed away alive as he stood with his eyes closed and let himself hope.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: "You have power, while many women are weak."
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the door, he added that he would say more about the Commission's meeting.
All cables and television networks were sent alive later when the Court of Justice had to vote on the presentation of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote on the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the case against the candidate was investigated by the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially talked to his friend, democratic senator Chris Consons.
After the conversation with Conse and several other senators, Flake decided.
Fleke's voice was important because it was clear that without investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Mayow accused criticism of Brexit 'political'
Ministerial President Theresa Mayov, in his discussion for Sunday Times, accused the critics of his plan to leave the European Union that "political" regarding the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mayo will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another discussion, which was close to the title-side prime minister, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on her so-called Chechers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose one another is "unreasonable".
Shooting on Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteona Simpson, who is suspected of dead LSU player
The police arrested the suspect in case of the shooting of Wade Simse, 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department reported that Dyteon Simson 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-level murder charge.
The authorities published a video on the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, he lost his watch.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police have secured mirrors at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to the police, after hearing him, admitted he shot Wade.
According to the treasurer, cash was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the crown office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The department is grateful to the police unit for the refugees of the state of Louisiana, the criminalized state police laboratories, the Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "smoothing and promotion of justice".
Simsio was 20 years old.
Two-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 guesses.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was "increased" and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," said Wade.
Mexical soup of poppy in Mexico City
Poppel, which falls off the Popacatépetl soup, invaded the south fourth of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention in Saturday protected Mexico from getting closer to its own, after the activity of the volcano increased and within 24 hours 183 floods and floods were recorded.
The center was following a series of drills and cracks.
Social networks have revealed images of the main cars covered by tanks of some kind in the fourth Mexican City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the soybean, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) south of the main cities. The last earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017 and had 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the year of the vote on independence, the police attacked the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after they were shot at by the police and thousands of people joined in the competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which divided Catalan.
The regular police blocked a group of masked separatists who were wearing eggs and fur color. These on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also clues that the police had to use their guns to calm down.
For several hours, groups of supporters of independence sang "Don't forget, we won't forgive" faces in the face of the protesters of the Union who called "Let Spain live".
According to local press, fourteen people were injured in protests.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is celebrated by the separatists of the Catalans, remains the pressure in the region that continues to increase its independence.
The majority expressed their preference for independence, but the participation in the elections was low because the refusal to renounce them was counterproductive.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in electoral places throughout the region.
Groups supporting independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration was over, but she had to choose another route.
Eightteen-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said he was no longer hoping for independence for Catalan.
"Lonni has lived one of the best moments.
My parents were happy that they could vote, but now we're in the dark street," he said.
Despite the important fact that the close victory in the regional elections of Loni in December of the Catalan side had to fight for independence in order to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders were either going to exile themselves or waiting in court for their part in the referendum organisation and the next declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old Mount Joan Puig filed a protest to support the police on his phone and says that the conflict has sparked politics on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," she adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for the trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that the next year will be running to the European Parliament.
"Candidatura in European elections is the best way to remedy the impact of democratic values and repressions we are witnesses from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after car crash into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car repeatedly hit home in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said it came to damage the wall and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot someone out of the car.
Meng's match has secured Livingstone's victory 1-0 over Rangers
The first round of Dolly Mengy for Livingston gave victory
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerard a second defeat of 18 matches in the role of the director of the club from Ibrox.
Tref Dolly Mengy showed up in favor of his team at Gary Holt's second-place Hibernian.
Gerard's team at this season has not yet won the Premiership game and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
In the meantime, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded a number of non-victuals in the division for six rounds, so the main coach Holt, who shot Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried to win.
Livingston didn't take advantage of the chance against unsuspecting guests.
Holt's team had to take a long time ago because his direct influence on Rangers caused a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the defense, but before the defense failed, then Alan Lithgow in the castle just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the bank.
The host had enough to watch the Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could use standard situations.
That's how the keyhole came in.
Against Rangers was set free and Livingston created a sculpture, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Meng together, which the game in the middle of the cooking field ran and ran.
In this phase Rangers dominated the holding of the sword, but domestic defenses were inevitable for them, and the banker Liam Kelly mostly had little work to do.
The same picture of the game was also during the second season, even when Alfredo Morelos took Kelly to the roof.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allan McGregora and Lithgow from another standard situation in Livingston.
In the mining area of Livingston, there are still centres that have been frequented by players, and there have also been two pintals – after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton's hostage and another hand.
"Fenomén" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They had no exceptions, and on their way up there they continued to overcome expectations.
Their style of games and men have almost changed since their return to the spy, but Holt deserves great praise for coming out of the team.
He had so many horns.
Captain Halkett was enormous, led by a well-organized defense, while Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all along.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They were good under Gerard, but these standards don't work.
Their finals were chaba – only once they crossed the home side – and for Rangers it should be a building because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was waiting for mixed reception in Colin
When Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29th) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smiles were the same.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, whose aim is to establish relations between NATO unions.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of print and acceptance of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colin, where he opened a huge new museum.
In this city there is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25 thousand people from meeting before the mosque, but many supporters were found around the scene who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were protesting against Erdogan who rejected his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposite protests reflect the controversy of a visitor who was praised by some German Turks as a hero and others as a carjacker.
An accident in Deptford: Cyclist died after a car crash
In London, he died a cyclist after fighting a car.
The accident occurred about 10:15 a.m. local time near Bestwood Street crossings with the Red Street Evelyn Street in Deptford on the south side of the city.
The driver stopped, and soon the nurse arrived, but the man was dead.
Only a few months after the other biker died about a mile and half of a Saturday tragedy at the Children's Street accident when the driver took off.
The Metropolitical Police reported that the police are now trying to identify and inform the man of his business.
The road is closed, the buses are on their way back and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin connection: Six monitors were injured in non-rooms
According to the prison office, six suspects were injured in male prisons at the market.
The disturbances broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday about 9:30 a.m. local time and still last.
In order to manage the charges against eight prisoners in one row, specialized observers from the "Tornado" team were invited to attend.
Doctors suffered mild injuries and were injured on the spot.
Speaking in prison, the speaker said: “In order to handle the current incident in Long Lartin prison, there was a special training of prison staff.
Six members of staff were injured by injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time on the networks."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delligents in the country.
In June it was announced that the director of the prison had ended the attack in the hospital.
And in October, the Loni were sent to prison by order units because of serious disturbances, where staff were attacked by gangs.
Hurikán Rosa is threatened by the waters of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where drought can benefit)
It is not unusual for Arizona to experience a tropical drought of low pressure, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane defeats the desert southwestern and brings the risk of privat flooding.
National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning against morning and afternoon floods from West Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will be out on her way over Phoenix tomorrow and bring the rain in the morning.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950 onwards, only ten tropical cyclones were kept at a distance of up to 120 km from Phoenix’s tropical storm or pressure down!
Katrina (1967) was kidnapped another 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Horicans predict cuts 50 to 100 mm in the Mogollon Rome area in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert north-west, including the middle of the rocks and the Great Wall, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local floors up to 100 mm.
For those who don't threaten the spring rains, the rain of Rossy can be a blessing because the area is dry.
Swimming is a very important thing, but these wounds may help somewhere, because the South West U.S. has just dried up.
Server weather.com points out that according to U.S. Drought Monitor services more than 40% of Arizona at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The trip to the town of Rosa first takes her to Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still strong with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet with the coldest waters of the Pacific Ocean, and then it will lose its force.
It's expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico there will be strong strikes, which represent a high risk of flooding.
“In the area of Baja California after the north-west Sonor, total cuts 75 to 150 mm are expected, which can be emitted up to 250 mm,” states the weather.com server.
Rosa then looks like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north, and in the morning she comes to the Arizona border. Then she passes to Arizona and at noon she enters the South Utah.
"It is expected that the main risk of Rosy or its remnants will be very strong attacks in Baja California, the northwestern Sonor and the desert southwestern United States," the National Centre for Huricans reports.
It is expected that these rains will cause deadly dangerous volcanic eruptions and floods in deserts and droughts of soil in the Horn.
Flight to Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As she informed the police from Avan and Somerset. Young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
The police are looking for witnesses who might have on the phone a record of what happened.
The trumpet says that Kavanaugh "has tried to make a relationship" Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the independent and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a petition in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Theump announced that during the process Kavanaugh "has tried nothing" the Democratic Party's nomination.
Kavanaugh told Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that she had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
She also told Ford about her case.
The President said on Saturday that day "the American witnesses were Kavanaugh's qualities and qualities and qualities".
A representative of his prosecutors from West Virginia said that "the voice of a confirmatory judge of Kavanaugh is one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service account".
The President did not directly criticize Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the election in half the functional period.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important love in our lives.
I don't apply, but I'm still moving," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The trumpet announced that the Democrats had decided to "resist and stop".
The Director of the Republican Party told the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate is expected at the latest Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to grow.
The authorities announced on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi had suffered extensive earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people had come to life, many of whom had suffered massive floods that had flooded the beaches.
On the beach in the city of Palu, hundreds of people attended the festival on Friday. The coastal areas were surrounded by up to six-footed waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that was going on their way.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people continued to go on in the activities on the beach and immediately didn't run, so they fell for the victim," said the Indonesian Agency for the Relief of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro on the bridge in Jakarta.
"The Vlna didn't go alone, she took her car, clubs, homes, everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that the Vln Tsunams on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He indicated that some people fled to the trees before the flood and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the anti-pollution agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, paved and paved bridges and pooled water.
The results were reported on the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been felt in areas where 2.4 million people live.
In its declaration, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that energy released by the five-year power cuts was about 200 times greater than the power of nuclear bombs bound for the second world war on Hiroshima.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow siege, which could even increase the wool tots.
Nugroho described the damage as "extremely" and said it came to the destruction of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found locked under the roofs of broken buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were injured.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damages can be larger on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Doghra, which is near the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication "was simply protected without any information" from Dongry.
The Red Cross stated in its statement that there are more than 300,000 people living in the area, and it added that its employees and volunteers are heading into the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could even worsen," says the statement.
The Agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform the authorities that Paul had been involved in a wave of tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
At amateur social media events it is to hear how a man in the higher roof of the building guards people on the street against the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast will be covered by a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was not able to check the record immediately.
The earthquake and volcanic eruption caused a large explosion of electricity that interrupted communication around Palu, so the authorities could only be able to coordinate rescue work difficultly.
According to the military authorities, they started shipping freight aircraft using Jakarty and other cities, but evacuation people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and remained closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo was to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Saturday.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Dongry arrived in Paul's city, where employees were hiding in closets of the office building's property, the road saw images of evidence, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," she adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began to respond to disasters, some complained that foreign workers were not to come to Paul with great experience.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, resources and staff from abroad may begin at a place of disaster at the hands of a calamit, until the declared zone of national disaster is declared.
It's gone.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," says the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Ariani.
"As the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but there is still no such attitude."
When Paul was born the second night after the fifth earthquake and tsunamis, friends and neighbors who were still unaware of him still hoped that their love would be the miracles that relieve the troubled history of natural disasters.
They got out of the little boy's canal on Saturday.
On Sunday the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days at the cost of her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandon, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at the Asian game that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people at Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandinga, were his students.
"As a person who has been paralyzed for a long time, I have my own emotional distress," she says.
Mr. Gendon recovered, as in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the arrival of the Roa Roa Hotel, he confidently sent a message through whatsApp from the Pala competitor who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, ended with a seat sign instead of a two-bit front.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," she says.
The thieves took 26 750 USD while supplementing the bankate in Newport on the Levee
According to a press report from the Newport police department, on Friday morning the crime was dropped by 26,750 dollars by Brink's employees in addition to Newport's bankomat on the Levee.
As Dr. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver emptied the car into the entertainment complex and prepared to put another money into it.
When he did this, another man "was running out of Brink's employees" and stole a bank accounter who was supposed to be put into a bank account.
The Witnesses reported that several suspects had disappeared from the scene, but the police did not reveal the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information on identity of suspects, please contact the police in Newport at numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes its name – on Yes.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "The Buddha is officially known as Kanye West."
Eleven-year-old West has been using Ye for some time and pseudonym as the name of its eight-year-old album that went out in June.
The change comes before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he should put his new Yandhi album.
In the show, the singer, Arian Grande, who gave up his part on "citizen's reasons" as the author of the order said.
The West has already said that the word for him has nothing but a short summary of the existing professional name and religious significance.
“In my view, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible where ‘you’ is’,” West was allowed to hear about the beginning of the year when he talked about his album with the voter Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It changed from Kanya, which means that only Yes – as a reflection of our good, our evil, our vengeance, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he gave priority to the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly Love).
Former West's JAY-Z co-worker also wrote with and without him and large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised he wouldn't use an army against civilians
On the occasion of the close 50th anniversary of the bloodbath against the students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that "he never uses his army to shoot a Mexican man."
At the time of the spread of leviathan students throughout Latin America, soldiers started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the city on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education would lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the United States should double the amount they are building on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published notifications on AI, although the United States as a whole has no formal intelligence strategy.
China has set up a plan to be a single in innovative AI by 2030.
"AI double budget would be a good start since all other countries are far ahead of the United States and we are looking for another half of AI," says Lee.
Lee said this week in the CNC discussion that double funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery would be made in the United States.
Lee, who published this month under the auspices of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt his book "Supervelmoci AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order", is the director general of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face+.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system, which convinced the best American player in Othello's game, and later he was the manager of Microsoft's research and head of the Chinese company Google.
Lee assessed the US government's previous technological competition, as was the Robotic challenge of the Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"Academic chips don't drive China, but corporate," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employed in recent years by the best university professionals to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve the AI area, according to Leeho, the United States could also help change immigration policy.
“I believe that the holders of a doctorate in the AI should be automatically offered green cards,” she says.
The State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of Art of a New Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Award provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way, such as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Intelligence Centre to engage partners from the industry and the academic environment this year, and White House has announced the establishment of the Selection Committee for Skills.
And the DARPA agency announced this month that it invests $2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF delivery, the AI now invests more than US$100 million annually.
All the United States legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art has been silent for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether they want to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in the referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", which would resolve a few decades of old dispute with Greece blocking the application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor represents an advantage on its territory, and therefore Macedonia has promised access to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded in June an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents intend that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said there would be no vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the vote raised doubts as to whether there would be at least 50 per cent of the voters needed to make the referendum available.
The question in the referendum was, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with Greece on the conclusion of an agreement?"
The sponsors of the change in the name, including President Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is the price they deserve to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. It could join the EU and NATO organisations.
"I have come today to wish for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
The Network referendum is not mandatory, but enough Members of Parliament said they would be guided by the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission indicated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
Moreover, the voluntary participation was only 16 per cent around 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were finally voted.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in the Macedonian referendum on a change in the name which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and stands before the seats of the people who oppose the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with the head concerned, not the door for service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are poor countries, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO member Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%, will bring so much investment.
"I think the great majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result of "yes" would be "a guarantee of our future".
According to a study published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could take part between 30 and 43% of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another study conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that 57 per cent of respondents were willing to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would like to.
To be successful, the referendum must be attended by 50 per cent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first major stage for Western government policy since its launch in May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City you've come across the entire block of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling worked for Brighton on Saturday, thus ensuring Manchester City win 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguera, his throat seemed ridiculous in 65 minutes.
It all started with the recording that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He spread between the three Britons and got into an open space.
Agura then wore four green shirts.
On the edge of the coast of Brighton's coast, one of his defenses landed and several other advances.
The next one on the left was Sterling.
An English attacker hit a match in the coastal territory back to Aguero, who actually persuaded Brighton's banker Matthew Ryan to shoot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," reported the reporters of City Pep Guardiola.
"We said it's gonna be 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky that he was making a hole at that time."
The original benefit for Sky Blues in this game is Premier League but Sterling ordered.
This hole fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a deep fight on the land of Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful fight to Leroy Sane.
He worked his sword and then sent Sterling to a distant uncle.
The Sky Blues racer locked a ball into the network just before closing out of the game.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. with Hoffenheim in the league of Masters at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
The cursor wants to destroy the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were out of the game-off fight, there were no many reasons to re-examine.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be placed at the top of the Colorado Rockies game – especially when they will have Rockies that will lead to NL West on one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, I hope to play-off.
Rockies got at least a wild card on Friday night winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is wonderful and the second team will probably play with the greatest effort I've ever had this year.
Why don't I wanna play it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are likely inclined to challenge Scherzer for such a situation.
On Thursday he'd train and challenge Sunday when he's usually free.
The Washington regulatory challenger has statistics 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 variables in this season.
The trumpet appeared at a meeting in West Virginia
The President did not express himself directly to the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans taking part in the election in half of the functional period.
"In November, everything we've done will be in vain.
One of the most important love of our lives is five weeks.
It's one of the great, great – I don't apply, but we're still moving and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued: “You see this fierce, vicious group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're decided to take too much by means of whatever means they need, you see poverty, resistance.
It's one of them who's hurt who has to turn to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resist and interfere".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added and said that the Democrats are "infuriated and evil and opposed and slander."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Commission, the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to the vote of the vote.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you produce this document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait – it was really a bad word of body – the worst word of body I've ever seen.”
The labyrinth is no longer an exchange of views.
He's not tolerant of those who express their views
When the activists from Momenta voted for my statement on my local side, there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of the labyrinth Members who said they were not welcome – because they gave their opinion honestly.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, did the same because anti-Semitism was firmly established.
In my case, they criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of the relevant economic policy, national security, Europe, the paradoxical issues which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In a note on the fifth meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was written that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of those eight years, which I was a local member of Parliament on the labour market, the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly like that.
In today’s world, such a large majority of people are unhappy and the promise of a “more generous, more attractive” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started with him.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated on the labyrinth and each opinion is considered to be acceptable for the management of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led by me, and colleagues whom I thought we had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stop positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I talk to the public – and no matter what I say – then there are a lot of challenges on social networks where they call for my call, they deplore central policy and tell me that I should not be in the labor force.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because I'm usually political.
I have respect for the professional and decision-making of my colleagues, who are facing social or racial prejudices every day, but never will.
One of the aspects of this era of politics that I'm most disappointed about is how infections become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the labyrinth party should pursue a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer this mixed opinion and with any proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more restrictive.
In the last two years, I've been working so many times to stay back, stay so quiet and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the labor force 32 years ago as a nursery in the labor force, the government of Margaret Thatcher, who allowed my class of general schools to disappear, has tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most — whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I've never been hiding my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
Those who supported the proposal on Friday would only say that when the country is going to Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand how to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborustic Party.
My main message is not for the moment in Nottingham, but for my voters whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political pragmatism does not make me do what I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is a MP for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Uncompressed Air Steps Up
Two late Fridays drew some final results, but there is no doubt that Air has earned himself in this wonderful fun game Tennt's Premiership triumph.
Now they're in front of the table, like the only thing to do.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the opportunity that helped the home to win, and the poet Peter Murchie had the full right to be at peace.
"In our game we have passed great trials and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy," she says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says to this: "All the honor of Ayru, the chances are better than us."
The fifth Grant Anderson, changed by Frazier Climem, sent Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who released Warriors for the game, enabled Melrose to use the digital transfer and Jason Baggot got an unchanged Friday.
The climate increased the management of Ayru's pentalto and then in a short time, it correlated and changed the solar test, so it adjusted to 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose started the second half good and the fifth Patrick Anderson, modified by Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was further detention due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knotta, who left the game on the shoes, and when it started to play again, Ayr re-extended thanks to the fifth Stafford McDowalla, who changed climate.
The representative Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used players in addition to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short pressure.
They returned home anyway, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow for the attack on the climate without the sword, MacPherson from the penal series put the ball behind the moving little Air.
The climate changed, almost again from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five fifths of the home.
The Still Game Star is starting a new career in the hotel
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series appears to be moving into the host range. It was found to be appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Sixteen-year-old Eric plays Jack Jarvise in the popular BBC series, which he writes and plays with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Two announced that the next nine series would be the last series of series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to a letter from the official register, it is the director of the company Aopiomorn Limited.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wants to join "progressive business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": domestic Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers are watching the seamanship in La Paz, which is beautifully decorated with laundromats.
The public buildings run a blue flag in the colour of the ocean.
The seabed of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon is described as: “The sea is ours.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout Bolivia there is still a living memory on the coast that the country has lost in the benefits of Chile in the blood war on resources in the 19th century – just as it is a storm to recycle the Pacific.
These concerns may be the largest for several decades because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice which should fall on 1 October after five years of imprisonment.
"The pain has energy, the spirit of the unit and the rest, and of course it expects a positive outcome," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decision on large screens across the country with the hope that the Haagu tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of closed talks, Chile should discuss that Bolivia will provide sovereignty access to the sea.
The charismatic home president of Bolivia Evo Morales, who has before him a controversial battle for renewal next year, is also of great interest in the morning decision.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he said at the end of July.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN authority has no power to attract any Chinese territory while living in the Netherlands and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last argument was made shows that the case was "not complicated", according to Páz Zárate, the Chilean expert on international law.
And in the last four years, not only did Bolivia not support it, but it may even have been corrupted by it.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," Zarate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again be reunited, but after this it will be extremely difficult to deliver the discussion.
Both countries have not changed their terms since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veljé, representative of Bolivia in Haagu, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to end 139 years of conflict with each other's benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use the issue of the sea as a political haven for Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America.
"The afflicted will never have the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear weapons unless it's able to believe in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people never use their nuclear weapons as the first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN's Valne Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made on the sum of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after what appears to be the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo's intention to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that led to a dead point for more than three months for Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says they're "planned to hope" that the ongoing sanctions and the United States' intention against the declaration of the end of the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on the knees.
Washington is careful with regard to the agreement with the declaration if Pchjongjang does not first take decisive steps to arm.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
It is, however, general scepticism that Pchjongjang really thinks it's going to end this arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris's reviews show that your fashion shops will soon find the latest trend of large head coverings
If you want to expand your collection of clubs or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The leaders of Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of broken huge head coverings for their collection of jaro/year 2019 on the scene that everyone received during the Paris Week.
Very unprofessional clasps flew Instagram this summer and these bidders sent their growing creations to the ground.
The exhibition came from Valentina with a wide range of reminders of the pearl that had flown through the head of the model.
The other extra large supplements were decorated with melons, magic hats and even pineapples – but they are not intended to burn their heads.
Tom Browne also presented the choice of magic masks – and just in time at Halloween.
Many of the pestrobaric masks have the protection of their teeth and remind Hannibal Lecter more than the high way.
One generation recalled the underground equipment and with snow and lightning, while the other seemed like a horn with a broken ice.
And if you're going to go on with a huge mode – you're lucky.
Modal experts predict that large-scale chips could also be reached in fashion.
Adult clasps come after "La Bomba" with a half-foot wide cramp, which they all wore from Rihanny after Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural character behind this very unprofessional clout that swept the social media has sent to the observatory another huge creature – a fragile beach bag that is almost as large as the model in the lungs that carry it.
The dark orange Rafe bag, stripped of raffins and arranged white leather handles, was on the Paris fashion week by the exhibition collection La Riviera jaro/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
A celebrator named Luke Armitage said to the FCCC: “I expect great clichés and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next year – given that the designer had so much success with them, it would only be difficult to ignore the demand for too much supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements and this continues to produce other outstanding test results in 2018. Individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities only supports this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, represent the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and strives to ensure the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their demands for further and higher education, a career they have chosen, and their place for global citizens.
As the education sector that can propose and carry out individually appropriate school education plans, we note that modern languages are still loved and desired objects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes directly to his heart."
It's a big challenge to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, but we can't rely on English alone.
The latest results of this year’s trials show that languages are at the top of the table, with no higher degree of success having independent schools.
Nearly 68 percent of the cases of foreign - language students received the best A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS Member Schools show that the highest score A reached 72 per cent of students in Mandarin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects that love jokes are considered in independent study plans and other schools such as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the language skills are insufficient for the reasons which employees present as problems in the provision of free space.
That is why language skills become increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
Given the increasing number of working opportunities required languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
If a person is already choosing any career, if he learns another language, he will benefit in the future because he has such a lifelong ability.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks more languages is automatically benefiting from competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, among 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to deliver a conversation, with the only language spoken by two-digit per cent of people, in particular 15 per cent, French.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in learning languages.
If children learn more languages, especially developing languages, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland is different from the language they learn.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others study languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
If the child is already interested in anything, he will always have independent schools to choose from a number of languages with learners who are in a given team of experts.
Scottish independent schools are committed to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and train are the skills needed for success, regardless of what they are expected in the future.
At this point, it cannot be said that languages are essential for the future of the country in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as "International Communication Skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and significance to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself on Sunday in San Diego for the first time in Lakers
The fans who are happy when LeBron James comes first for Los Angeles Lakers are waiting soon.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in the Sunday's opening game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
It's still not clear how many minutes she's playing.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is probably only playing a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the training, James asked for his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-session.
"At this stage, I don't need pre-sessions," he said.
The trumpet performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his campaign at Wheeling in West Virginia tonight.
It's the first of five hits planned for the next week, including a stop at friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the approval of his candidate for a position of independence in the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as the Republicans are in November elections prior to the risk of the loss of Congress.
How many hours of the night does the trumpet show start and how can you follow it online?
The summit in Wheeling in West Virginia is planned at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch the trumpet in West Virginia online by means of live transmission to YouTube.
The trumpet will probably be talking about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who spent this week and was very drunk because of the allegations of sexual misconduct. It is expected that the signing vote of the Senate will be postponed for a week before the FBI's investigation.
But the main objective of this wave of protests is to help the Republicans take the time before the November elections.
According to the Reuters agency, the organizers of the campaign, President Trumpa, say that these five meetings in the next week aim to "add the energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of those in the Senate and in the Snowy Representatives".
"The control over the Senate is so important for its agenda that the president will be taking the campaign to as many countries as possible in this critical season," said the Reuters agency of the spokesman of the Trump campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News polling station Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, supporters from "Ohia and Pensylvania could be followed by the media from Pittsburgh".
This will be second in the last month, which Trump will visit West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the investigation.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President must come to help him in his research," says the Reuters Policy Agency of the Western University of Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has shown that it has a stomach to fight to keep hope ahead of Sundays alone
After three single sessions, the Saturday couple can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
Smelling is a completely designed sport concept, but players really believe it, and most of all on such competitions.
So where's the whale going to get together now?
"They know about six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so that the whale seems to move a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a benefit, it has four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel they have some wind in their plates, and there are many things that can awaken them, for example the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomases, who played together all day and each can fit together three points from four.
Spieth was dying on the transition from the fire to the green and goes for example.
Famous shouts still strengthened his car as he managed the key course to win the entire match when they were with Thomas on two jackets on the back.
His route, which won their game on the 15th floor, met a similar race that tells you that the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players left.
18 jackets for leaving the foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
It's wonderful, but the lovely two from Europe are four of them and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only two who did not meet the janitor on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The process and way in which energy flows as a direction to the angry public, it confirms from it that these are players destined for the informal victory, and that in the west of the sun over Le Golf National there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best of both on a different jacket.
However, the European celebration remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had recently worked with Sergei García, a brave early game with four cats when he was interviewed with Alex Noren.
The Jamk and the two of them buried Spain and Sweden in a state of ruin that they had never seen before.
But on Sunday no one can help you.
Two games on two balls are so fascinating when you closely monitor the interaction of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
Europe played better as a team, and in the last day it was a great hit, but this game also showed that the US team had a boredom for the fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
To the final day of Ryder Cup leads Europe with 10-6 points
Europe gets a healthy benefit until the last day of Ryder Cup after the two rounds of Saturdays on two rounds with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who probably won at least twice as many winning over the missing Tiger Woods, decided to make four matches in Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to maintain the trophies they lost in Hazeltin, dominated in early games on two American side games that settled in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, they won two matches, but they couldn't get to the deficit.
The Jim Furyk side needs eight points of the Sunday's 12th game to stop the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points for himself, while he and Molinari, who after the senate weekend received the "Mollwood", are just the second pair who won four points of their four initial matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After winning the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then the cold beat the tired Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5&4.
Woods, who spent two matches on Saturday, showed temporary flashbacks, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game on two games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who started the early game on two games, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the game two on 2&1 wins Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - one and three times in the world's pocket.
But Europe did not have this pleasant fresh day from southwestern Paris won all over Paris.
Three-thirds of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won for the Americans on Saturday two points.
They won the final 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two games and later returned to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 47-3 in the game, although two first jacks won.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from a four-year deficit to a double, although as the fascinating Furyk side just needs a break to get a trophy.
After the second day's best for two days, it seems like there's no one to work for them.
North Korea says they don't act unilaterally and without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued UN sanctions would deepen their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country would never surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual wave gathering that North Korea has adopted "a significant measure of good will" last year," such as the suspension of nuclear and rocket tests, the demolition of nuclear testing sites and the promise that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be spread.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to defend itself unilaterally."
While Ri has raised known North Korea's concerns with regard to Washington's resistance to "progressive" approach to denuclearisation, it would have been awarded to North Korea for every step in progress, its declaration has been considered significant in that it has not refused unilateral denuclearisation only since Pchjongjang has already passed.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Čong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim committed himself to working on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is working on the formal end of the war from 1950 to 53, but the United States said that Pchjongjang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington also called for the release of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US continues to ‘first denuclearization’ and raise pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives, and even object to ‘expression of the end of war’," said Ri.
"I think that sanctions can bring us to knees, are the dreams of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the three meetings of Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States were on the side of this issue, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not be in such a bad situation."
However, the Rio scene was dramaticly different from that of London when he told the U.S. General Assembly that the focusing of North Korea's rocket on the U.S. territory was inevitable after the "pang bad president" Trump identified Kim as a "racet man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Tromp, which threatened North Korea's "total destruction" last year, commended Kim for his refusal to take steps to arm, but said that much work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
In the middle of the trip said that there is no time frame, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue indiscriminately and without delay until we know the complete, final, verifiable denuclearization"
The Security Council has consistently supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to facilitate the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missile programmes in Pchjongjang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.S.N. fair meeting, and Pompeo announced that the next month he would visit Pchjongjang to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not ended well.
He left Pchjongjang in July and announced that progress had been made only in order for North Korea to declare him "gangster requirements" within a few hours.
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon this month to detonate the rocket area and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "responsive measures".
He said that Kim announced that "relevant measures", in which he hoped, were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and directed to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students are participating in a course that will teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year took all its students to sleep more, and it's in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night when students don't sleep and wake up with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most advanced university are often unsatisfied when it comes to the basis of self - care.
Curz proposed Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital, which is thought to be his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after he presented the impact of sleep depression on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me this right now in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of bed - which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall manner.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of medical services at the university, said that the university decided to take a course after finding out that students were really not exposed during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of student wheels where students click on cups of coffee, tea, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper space skills.
On the other hand, participants are informed of how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart failure, death, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the conduct of students does not change immediately.
However, we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of "studying all night" continues to exist, adding that modern technologies and growing pressure on students mean that there is a growing problem of lack of sleep.
A sufficient sleep quality should be a “secret weapon” for the student to fight stress, exhaustion and fatigue, he said - even so that it does not come to the collection, because sleep deprivation can break the brain into the cooling system, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler to design a course that graduated one of his classes during his first year of high school in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press on the whole course.
It is hoped that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider the alarm settings when going to bed as soon as they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “morning light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can solve your circadian rhythm, which leads to urinating problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga hit Gerard's husband
The Rangers suffered another loss when the Count Dolly Mengy found out that Steven Gerard was in trouble with the 1-0 battle in Livingstone.
The Ibrox side tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1st of the triumph at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holta team only won the second defeat of Gerarrd in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the previous leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago, and the Rangers set seemed uninspired and determined to solve.
While Rangers are now heading to sixth place, Livingston is swimming on the third floor and immediately following the Hibernian team on a different branch.
And it could come to other problems Rangers after what was supposed to be a magic judge called Calum Spence infected with head injury after he was apparently infected by an object from the search.
Gerard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Air to the semi-final Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, which last week collected point Hearts and would be happy to see how his well-trained malery breathes his opponent at every step.
Rangers may have ruled the containment, but Livingston did more with the sword on their side.
They were only supposed to take care of two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's branch, but the founder buried his great chance.
The remote Keaghan Jacobse freeman then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the rear.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last three years there will be more hope than belief.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a pen for the fourth grade when he and Steven Lawless were in trouble, but decision-making Steven Thomson had challenged the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots for the first half, but former banker Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game in 34 minutes, no one can say that they've earned it in this field.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' big set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent a fight on Scott Robinson, who was calm and got Meng on the easy end.
Gerard took action at the stop and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing closed to Morelos, but the impeccable Kelly was struggling with the scars and the attack was blocked.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long match after another.
Holt's side could have been in final stages to deepen its grip, but McGregor made a good stand to block Jacobse before Litgow broke out of his arms.
The owner of Ranger's Glenn Middleton had another delay in the penalty when he questioned Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Eynalezce Geiger's reader
And now a page from our German "Saturday morning": September 30, 1882, is 136 years old today, and it's still coming... the day the future physics of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's science studio also became a standing pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of these seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s reader who is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up these hearing cells, you can really hear the effects of the atoms that are emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans said, "Well, now he's really mad about it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But you find someone who doesn't know his name, he's still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach an immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can “see” the protein that is common to many cancers and then take another injection
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had cancer of pregnant women for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracts of immune cells from patients who change them into laboratories, so they can "see" the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then be applied to the cell again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "leads the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells were removed from patients and “learned” was to focus on cancer cells, was already being treated with the type of leukemia.
Kanye West participated in the pro-temporaneous trial, in his cup of tea, and after his show at SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was quoted in a study on Saturday Night Live after a failed performance during which President Donald Trump praised him and said he would be running in 2020.
After singing the third song that night with the name Ghost Town, in which he had a Mace America Great Again, he started swimming on democracy and supported President Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they say, ‘How can you just like Trupa, because he is a racist?’”
If I were to lead racism, I wouldn't be in America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started a parody show with Matte Damon in the main role where the Hollywood star was playing with Britta Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's trial committee on the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this has not been sent, West's concerts of the theatre were preserved on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to smile at West.
The West also complained to the fans that he had a nice haircut on his head even in the backyard.
“In prison I was interrogated.
They said, "Don't come there with this cat."
It's a joke!
They also said I'm in the wrong place," said the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West went on, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and he added that "he would wear his superman suit because it means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were only served by public speaking at least twice, and members of SNL seemed frustrated, saying Variety, and one person even said: "The whole studio was completely quiet."
The West called as a late reward for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
The West defeated many of the people present by singing song I Love dragged into Perrier's pool.
The West received support from the leading Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most important characters: DÜKUYU, JE SES POSTAVIL DAVU."
But the host talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West "was just the one who he was, and that's really amazing."
“But I DON’T want to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’), who I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and goes to the feet of Didy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, previously named Snoop Lion and of course the famous music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Play Thrones Star Kit Harington admitted to toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jona Snowa with a sword in his hand in a violent midlife HBO series fantasy.
Herec, 31 years old, however, emerged from the stereotype of macho hero and said that such roles on screens mean that young boys often feel that they must be assertive to serve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit told me that he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star star on Rose Leslie's throne, also admitted that this problem is "too strong".
"At this point I personally feel quite strong - what happened to the masculinity so bad?" he said.
"What do we learn about the problem we see here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men by his very male attitude.
He continued: “What is born and learned?
What do the guys learn on television, on the streets, from the feeling that every man needs to have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big issues in our time - how to change it?
Because a young man must have changed something to worse.
He also agreed in the discussion that he would not play in any proquel or sequencing game on the throne after the end of the series, because he already has enough “fights and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in the restored legal background of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Herec recently left that meeting his present wife, Rose, for the best thing that came out of the game about the throne.
"I met my wife at the opening of a series, so she gave me my future family and my whole life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, an object of the love of Kitty's John Snow's stand, in this fantasy of the series appreciated by Emmy.
A couple took place in June 2018 in the lands of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% increase in new cases
China reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, this virus has reached more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of the new cases were transferred by sex, which meant a change in the rest of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero by Chinese physicians at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is likely to continue to spread.
In view of the country's conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married.
Many of the disabilities result from lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters writes that staff would let go of the data of the GOP senators, the term "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
The US delegation of Maxine Waters rejected the claim on Saturday that a member of her employees sent personal data to three U.S. senators on lawmakers.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charge was supported by "opportunity" scientists and websites.
"Lie, lie and other disgusting lies," Waters said in his statement on Twitter.
The information published has probably included addresses and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on Thursday and published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate's trial of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh.
There were times when the three senators were talking about Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is a source of contributions, is linked to Waters office and published information on the members of Waters company, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were threatened by these double and false charges – was not in any case responsible for the lack of such information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly served as an online criticism, including from the former printer secretary of the White House of Ari Fleisher.
"This confusion is angry," Fleisher wrote.
"This means he doesn't have a temper to be a member of Congress."
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't get hurt.
It shouldn't be embarrassing.
You can't doubt the complainant's motives.
He must be calm and not get upset."
Fleisher seems to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who criticized him for being too frustrated during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was in love with Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In his statement Waters stated that her office warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings on these double orders.
"We will ensure that the security guards are released," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and all my staff."
Johnny English re-enters reviews – poor Spanish parody Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new movie with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this Johnny English re-resurrection in a series of action parodys - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this continued satirie on the issue of how clearly we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this emerging non-compliant Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to pack this thing again in a completely new way - a name more than any other sign that there is a broad comical design intended for non-English-speaking cinematographic audience.
He is of course the dumb secret agent who, despite his wonderful promise of smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a spy from Mr. Bean and a big cousin of that guy who took the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the Festival's beginning of Olympics in London 2012.
The position is also originally based on a traveler and an international secret man who once played atkinson in previously forgotten television advertisements Barclaycard, who left behind chaos.
In this last issue J is one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the middle of the drilling and the leg of the rotor shortly hung about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but humor feels quite undersized and extremely excessive, especially when "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedies as a safe component of their production.
Humor is more like a kid than an adult, and for me, Johnny English's crazy trampoons are as inventive and central as Atkinson's silent film gangs in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
The cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-thai web network of spies and withdrew the identity of all British agents in the field to scare an agent into service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldona.
It is the last cap for the prime minister, who is a bold and busy position that is already suffering under the complete condemnation of political instability: Emma Thompson of this joy Theresa May set up the best game, but there is nothing too much in the scene.
Her rapporteurs inform her that once her active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from her retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now a director of some luxury equipment, is also giving a record lecture on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gays, because English offers a Spanish Academy like the School of the Year.
English returned to Whitehall because of the emergency briefing and met with his former long-term endurance partner Bough, who played again Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the boss of a ponor, an affected position on which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine may also be a bit of affluence.
So Batman and Robin in packing tasks for His Majesty's Secrets are back in action and meet with a beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bullett, who played with Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the control of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: violent Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their dozen frescoy pattalies: masking as cleaners fires a French restaurant; creating chaos when they fall on Volt's luxury yachts; and English descends clean anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's home with virtual realities.
All the essays are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how nice and hot it is, it's got something on the children's television.
It's quite a matter of concern.
And just like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't have thought: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Laborists hope to develop a four-day work plan for England to get paid in five days a week
The labist side of Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party is likely to want the chief companies to give the employees the support that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy the weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
The source claims that this idea would "go" into the economic agenda of the party and plan to attract the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Committee Unions as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
A long-term worker pointed out for Sunday Times: “It is expected that the assessment of this measure will be notified by the end of the year.
It will not happen during the night, but the fourth working week is a expectation which depends on the position of the parties to measure the economy in the interests of workers and the overall industrial strategy of the parties."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an opinion, the Green Party has signed a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this prospectus is currently not approved by the labyrinth as a whole.
"The four-day working week is not our party's policy and the side does not take it into account."
St. John McDonnell used last week's workshop to complete his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to return energy from "anonymous managers" and "witnessers" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders in water companies should not return to their overall share because the labor government could carry out "fixes" on the basis of the case-by-case basis.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company’s administrative council and to create funds for own property which transfer 10 % of their own capital to private companies who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in order "60 minutes", whether the study of the FBI could change their view
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has removed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Authority's findings could be expected by some Republican senators to support them.
In a discussion of Sunday's "60 minutes" the correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that might change their view.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him when it happened that the charge went out, and he said, 'Did you do it?'
He was decisive, determined, unique."
However , the Graham 's decision is inconceivable .
"I have already made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a really explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one: Brett did it hard," said Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of them could verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the annual Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very effective series of stars and the same powerful mission at the end of the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will join Central Park to enjoy not only such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real target of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was introduced in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get free access to shares (if you did not want to pay for VIP entry), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, e-mail to world leaders, telephones or other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before he achieved his goal?
Is it the idea to give people a free concert in such a way as to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clictivism" - people who have the feeling that they sign online posters or send tweets, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its contractors, trying to achieve different objectives.
He says that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which will affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
By the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and realisers who committed to "help children grow in their full potential", promising Rwanda to provide $35 million in support of the country’s recovery after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Cities, as you are, we can only make a note in history of the social injustice in the form of subjugation,” said the editor of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman’s gift during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 shares called for by the U.K. to improve the survival of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which comprises 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on our website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long, hard way - down and down.
But just like the great civil law and the campaign against apartheid, we succeed in front of us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the most effective in New York's annual anniversary, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use marine for "blockage" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can "if necessary" escape to the sea in order to prevent the fall of Russian energy on the market, including the Middle East, from leaving the US Minister inside Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it leads to the call for legitimate government - is an obstacle to examining new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to spend energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the opportunity here to make sure that maritime routes are open and, where necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke has implemented actions organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group which is called "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is mainly investment in or replacement of decent weights," he said, and at the same time refers to Russia as "one-purpose" players with economic dependence on fossil fuels.
The declaration is coming because the Trump administration is on mission to force its exports of compressed land gas to Europe and rewarded Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trupa, made from Berlin "rujm" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 is a purely economic project worth $11 billion, which has doubled its existing capacity to consume 110 billion cubic metres.
Kremlin claims that Washington's heat resistance to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is, for example, by some competitions.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for the development of pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perrym in a meeting in Moscow.
The U.S. took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises that "near" will be seen on a presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in half of the electoral period, the candidate "sees close" to the president.
During the workshop in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and make our disintegrated government, including the highest women's position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll look closer to the presidential candidate."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that he "will lead this country in the wrong direction".
"I fear until the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened up in his criticism of Trump and his appointment as the Supreme Judge, Britta Kavanaugh.
On Friday Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not think she should apply in 2020.
Thirty-eight percent of "probably" voters from Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run, according to surveys Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent would support the candidate.
The study showed increased support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38 per cent for the candidate and 48 per cent against it.
Among other highly established democratic names, which were discussed in connection with the potential candidate by 2020, was former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermonto Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent after listing in September one year in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What happens to my own son, what goes on after his return, can affect other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some injuries our soldiers return with,” said the public at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “a seat in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they return a little different, they return to their homes, they come back and ask if there is even respect for the things their fellow soldiers and aircraft and every other member of the army give their country.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla on Aljašce and charged with domestic violence against women, arresting reports of domestic violence and holding weapons in custody, Dan Bennett, spokesman of the police department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new measure by the US government that will prevent asylum from being subjected to the threat of gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 States and the period of Friday in Washington issued a brief message on Friday to support asylum seekers and questioned this measure, the NCB stated.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which was not disclosed by the American Civil Liberties Organization in July.
She said her partner "and her sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was kept in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States returned to the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Senate, which allowed illegal immigrants who are suffering from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a fifth statement, Prosecutor General Karl Racine of D.C. stated that the new measure " ignores the decade of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a ban violates this principle," said a short friend.
Lawyers further strongly argued that policies that encourage immigrants' entry are damaging the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "add necessary work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration to no longer commit asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available for those who leave their home country because of the persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said the Sessions in their statement of 11 June.
Azyl never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Trusted rescue trials in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, will run in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very drunk," said 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, who delighted her hot boyfriend in the evacuation center in the desert city of Palu.
"Every minute the sanitizer will bring other bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The citizens were seen coming back to their destroyed homes, picking up through the stuff and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some injuries, including Two Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the liver and arms, were restated at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continued strong following seizures.
His tears filled his eyes when he felt that violent earthquake had taken him to a hotel room in the fifth floor, where he shared the room with his wife and daughter.
‘There is no time to save.
I think I've been trapped into a building," Haris said to Associated Press and added that his family was in town because of the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
They're probably okay."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with "schicanization" propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-party commercial in the American daily, which was awarded the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, an American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump in the past mentioned China Daily's paid contribution in the Des Moines Register - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowa - after which China blamed China for trying to move into American congressional elections in the United States on November 6.
The team's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with American elections indicated what the American representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of the campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to introduce commercial advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of shock in the emerging trade war, which is at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese defence sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to attack exporters in the states, such as Iowa, which supported the Republican side of the Turks, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American prime minister in China and former long-term Governor Iwo, an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now redoubled by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American price tradition of free display and free press to place advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspaper station on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited votes inconsistencies and you will not see any real reflection of the unsound views that China might have on the disturbing economic road in China, given that the media belong to the company "The Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspaper said.
Republicans leave their voters in the face of the elections because of the defeat of Kavanaugh, protecting analysts
As many spy republics challenge the candidate to Supreme Judge Britta Kavanag, who is facing several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that during the coming half-term elections, they know the answer, especially from women.
Emotions around this case were extremely high and most of the Republicans on the record already say they want to continue with the vote.
These things can't come back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) will be working on the FBI's investigation to calm down the voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow and not even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and speech group MoveOn, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors complained "The November is near!" at a demonstration in the Senate, where the Republicans who are concerned about the justice commission decided to call Kavanaugh over the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Democratic inspiration and motivation will be the market of records," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say it was already high, it's true."
However, this could be higher, especially between female female voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony, the analysts proposed that if the Republicans confirmed it, they could follow up on their charges of sexual assault on the candidate of the Supreme Court.
"It was an inconsistencies for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republic, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee or about the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh is sitting on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed and dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, USA's top leader, a group that helps to favour democracy, pointed to the report channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with some more sympathy for another named.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents have either firmly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent indicated that Kavanaugh is certain or likely to believe.
In addition, 38 percent indicated that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flakaho FBI at the present time, the charges raised by Ford, like at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate committee last week that Kavanaugh had been attacked by drunks at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the festival during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web website is planning to launch a new Internet and predict Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, researcher World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is located on the Open Source platform of Berners-Lee company called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he pointed out that the purpose of the Inrupt project is "world government."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "private online database" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music books and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disc Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and at the same time.
What is on the personal online database is exceptional is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to any type of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to provide John Bruce with resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project, working on the project and the community of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with "Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned up by night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his contribution to the media published on Saturday, wrote that sending the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new website based on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the spiritual celebration that was held during the first world war by Victoria Kriz
The celebrations have passed since the time when the only spiritual Church of England received Victorian cross as a warrior during World War I.
Deputy Colonel Bernard Vann received an evaluation on September 29, 1918 at an attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman and he never realized he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons gave him a memorial stone on Saturday at the festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was "generally symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather.
According to the newspaper London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very loud sound and a strong shot of full works and bullets."
Later he got to the first line and with the "highest lift" led the front line before he himself entered the deck field and hit three selected units.
Colonel Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I'd never do but something that's humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, the overseer of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he took the lead in the youth group.
Michael Vann said that "he felt a great honor that he could share in the audience," and he added that "the courage of the real hero is a support that gives a lot of people."
The MMA fans stayed all night to follow Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa's scar.
Imagine what you've been waiting for all night to watch Bellator 206, just to open your main event.
The account from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live shipments spent all night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's party, the fans in Great Britain were surprised when the report changed to the order on Peppa.
Some remained unreproached after they were in the early hours of the morning because of the game.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the order for children as "a true form of bad joke."
"In accordance with the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning and it is therefore necessary to send children's orders," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator after he was asked about this transfer.
"Prasátko Peppa," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they'll work on the program so that there will be future engagements and fans in Great Britain.
"I think that when I think about sending, we can probably manage it," said Cooker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't do it until Sunday in our time.
But we're doing it.
Trust me, when the program changed, many text people went there and back, and not everyone was just friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't possible for the government to do that.
I promise you it'll never happen again.
We reduce it to five savings instead of six – as we usually do – and we have tried to keep our promise to the fans and we have not been able to do so.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sex
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not all are like him."
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, represented by Lauren Laverne, said that the voice spoke about gay rights to give the other "hope."
He also said that, thanks to the possibility of becoming his parents, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
A regular long-term modator of Kirsty Young's order had several months of freedom due to disability.
Daley, who appeared as a three-year-old in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "lower" than anyone else who had grown up like him because "the society wasn't friendly enough to like you guys and girls."
He said, “These are the sentiments of a people who have been made to feel inferior, and of other things, which have given me strength and great success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "Someone," he said he wouldn't lie to anyone who could possibly find out how it was with his sexuality.
A double holder of the Olympic medal became a law-enforcement fighter for LGBT with a high profile and used his presence at the annual Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he had to feel happy that he could live openly without any consequences and wanted to add another "hope".
This three-year-old world champion said that his love for a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – "has become unprepared."
Daley, the keeper of Oscar, who was 20 years old, took over the past year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young – at his first Olympic when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar resurrections and disasters.
Two in June adopted Robert's son Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that he "has changed his whole outlook".
"If you were to ask me a question, it would be all in the style of "I want to get gold medals," he said.
“You know, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't object to his dying, and the last thing he asked was whether they had any letters in London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in previous ranks.
"I couldn't tell him – you're not in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not incapacitable," he said.
The year on which Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew I had spent my entire life on it – jumping before the air of our home on the Olympic Games, I don't know a better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first stocks – Proud from Heather Small – which resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympics and continued to cause hair loss.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47th, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to get out of shape to prevent it from going on an unhappy lover.
Mickelson, who played every two years on the subject record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes on the Winch.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the case in the United States, he spent his five-year-old main prize of his day playing between the fans and the games in order he hoped he would do what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, and it's not even at the top of his career, so it's not an ideal choice for the Le Golf National draw game, where the long member ground routinely beats the missing shots.
And if it's not a golf game itself that's pretty worried about itself, Mickelson is headed by the 9th Sunday champion British Open Francesca Molinarim, who won all four of his games this week in a team with new Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided the quick move, the Mickelson sword could have proved to be quite fundamental.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, and he didn't add anything else.
"Just as he understood the role he had today, he paid me back, gave me his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"So many believe.
He is a member of China and has been so successful for these teams in the past week.
I don't think I've been able to imagine he's playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson won Nick Falda's record in most of the west of Ryder Cup taken on Sunday.
It could mean the end of the career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 champions and seven remixes, although Furyk says his presence has brought some weightless results to the team.
"He's fun, he's funny, he's funny, he's happy to play with people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think young players also enjoyed the fun when they followed him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, from experience, knows that a big lead leading to singles from the last few days at Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable ride.
Data was debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where the company led by Captain Sive Ballesteros had a five-foot jump over the United States, but they achieved a total victory of 1411⁄2-131/2.
“You have to keep in mind that we had a big hit in Valderrama, just like in Brooklyn where we had won, and in Valderrama where we had won, but only firmly,” Bjorn said, on the picture, following a 5-3 win in 2018 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 Le Golf National.
So every member of this team showed me it wasn't for us.
Tomorrow you'll be fully offered.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not after you until all these points are on the table.
We have a goal and we're trying to get this trophy and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, happy that his players took him to a complicated golf course, added: “I would never do that myself.
The other animals are waiting for us tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're preparing individual performances and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you have to be there for yourself, your golfer's ability is fully checked.
It's the message you have to deliver to players to get out of you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he has to go and get it from himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will be trying to make his players play better as individuals than partners. Except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up as a winner when Europe arrived at "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every lost word," answered Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 Captain, who raised his players to the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important events, but you would like to start as soon as in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When it comes to one direction at this time, there is a significant pressure on these averages.
So we're going to keep this up and make the boys feel like you know what we should do tomorrow."
Thomas got the job of trying to get against and put Rory McIllroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it's covering the whole road," Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship has been repatriated
The latest German maritime cargo was recognised in 2014 to replace the old warship from the era of the Cold War, but it will not be available for at least one year because of the wrong systems and the polluted seas, local media indicate.
The supply of the leading ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a whole new flag of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to Di Zeit's speech army daily.
The ship was to become part of the maritime industry in 2014, but the problem of supplying had been resolved by the judge of this ambitious project.
As a reward for the ageing frigates of Bremen classes, four Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels will serve, which was already ordered by the sea in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an executive work, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistics and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic components.
Another important function is the long-term maintenance – it should be possible to install the latest frigates up to two years without home port.
However, the constant delay means that the schooner ships – which were likely to enable Germany to send forces into the sea – will be marked by Die Zeit's day-to-day.
Neblaze passed the F125 flag to the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
This was the first time the seagoing ship came back to the manufacturer after the transfer.
Only a little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of basic "software errors and lead on rock first" competitions that would make the warship useless when it was loaded into battle.
The software competitions were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will run a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workers who needed Bremen's cargoes.
It has also been shown that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits its ability to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonship Rhineland-Pfal will be twice as difficult as the ship's similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the competition on coal, it is also a problem for the whole project – including training teams.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price was EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have been particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the German marine power is fragile.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the Navy's "ships are coming."
The representative stated that the problems had been solved frequently because the old ships had been removed from operation but no compensation had been granted.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttenberg's flagships are capable of becoming part of maritime equipment.
The National Trust Organization belongs to the secret life of netupirs
In Scotland, a new research is being carried out on the site of non-petroleums, which is intended to detect how the non-petroleums use their land when hunting food.
There is hope that research will bring new light to the conduct of single-flight helicopters and will help guide future activities for this kind of conservation.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by the netupies of stars and at least the heat of long and water in the Inverwe Gardens Botanical Garden in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in the key areas of this non-urban settlement, which will monitor the activities of non-petroleum throughout the year.
Employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings will find out the frequency of calling necrops and what individual types do.
The following will be issued a map of the habitat and a report that will create a detailed national picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for negativity and how individual species use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the construction of a hole, and the best way to maintain established areas for sanitation and other related species.
The innocent population in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have suffered a great deal in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and land development that affect the colony and the natural environment.
The risk can also be represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as foot-and-mouth failure and chemical damage to building materials and cat attacks.
The Netupirs aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use the industrial echo-location technique for the release of brakes and brakes during the summer.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes necrops very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct studies, control of colonies and sometimes save jobs.
This organisation even established the first and only approved non-purchasing reservations in the Thireve settlement in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten types of non-pearls in Scotland.
The director of David Thompson's residence says it's the ideal land for them.
"We have a great area here in Thrave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But it's still too much we don't know about the negativity, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It highlights the importance of the control of non-petroleum prior to the start of maintenance work in property, as it is possible that an unknown destruction of one maternal nest can kill up to 400 monkeys and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
Netyprus are protection and it's illegal to kill them, make them hard, destroy or destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join the work and help.
She said, “We do not know how their people are treated, but we have to learn a great deal about them.”
Ronaldo refuses the charge of rape and his lawyers are going to appeal to the German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo noted the charge of rape for “false messages” and pointed out that people “want to be seen” using his name.
His lawyers are going to complain of German daily Der Spiegel who informed them of these charges.
This Portuguese and youth attacker was accused of rape by American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He probably then paid 375 000 dollars for the case to be silent, informing the daily Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after publishing information on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and marked the information for "false news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the fifth-year-old treasurer Gold sword into the camera.
"They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm okay," said a smiling player.
According to the Reuters agency, Ronald's lawyers are seeking to accuse the daily Der Spiegel of unsubstantiated charges which have marked as “unauthorized notification of suspicion in the private area”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will require compensation for "the moral damage in the highest corresponding gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights recently."
The event was due to take place in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to her home, where she was reportedly raped by a document given to the court in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo broke up after the incident and told her that he broke down by "99%" "load" and "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was sensitive.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and let the photo of her injuries be taken in the hospital, but later she agreed with an extrajudicial order because she "was afraid of the answer" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims she is now trying to resume the procedure because she is still traumatized by a certain incident.
Ronalda at the time of the attack of the Kraków from his move to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and bought him 100 million euros a year ago by the famous Italian Juve Club.
Brexit: Great Britain will always suffer the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will always fly” when it comes to its status as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it is "disquieting", that Toyota UK car told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would have temporarily stopped production in the Burnaston race near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car indicated that the impact of delays on the borders if the Brexit agreement is not concluded can be a job.
At the bus station in Burnaston, where Auris and Aventis are manufactured, almost 150 000 cars were manufactured during the year – 90 % of them were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover cars in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW points out that it will close its race for the production of Mini cars in Oxford immediately after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers indicate is the risk of supply chain failure in Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s company’s production line is in operation on the basis of a supply "just in time", with parts from suppliers in Great Britain and the EU being supplied for vehicles manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could result in a border breach which, according to the department, could lead to delays and lack of remuneration.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to work on the basis of more than one day in the Derbyshire race, which would lead to a stopover of production.
Mr Clark said that theresy Mayow's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need the agreement. We want to have the best trade that enables us, as I say, not only the current success but also the acquisition of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota's company but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue with what is very successful now the supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production would be stopped, but from a long-term perspective, it ensured that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and would eventually be at work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for 24 years in the Burnaston race and is chairman of the committees in the race, said that members of the board are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
The governments said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, indicating the White House
The High-level Donalda Trump meeting with Advocate General Rod Rosensteine would be "on next week's resignation", because he continues the fight against the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, he sent the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which examines the principles of Russian elections, the relationship between the Turks and Russia and the possible judicial obstacle by the President.
Whether the Trump is already losing its representative general power and thereby threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's troops are already dead for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing cameras to record a conversation with Trump and the opportunity to meet the president by means of Addendum 25.
Rosenstein passed the message.
Last Monday, however, he sent a message to the White House that he was about to give up.
The meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
The trumpeter announced that Rosenstein would not "more than" leave, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid hearing in the Senate's trial, where he gave witness to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Fordová.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the case against Kavanaugh, which was delayed by the full vote of the Senate.
The trumpeter's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox channel on Sunday.
In response to a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There has not been a date yet, it may be this week, and it may be necessary to postpone the next week in view of all the other things that are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always report the news to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not organized a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders reported that too few press conferences were not conducted on television reporters' "dividels", even though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that it's coming out."
Finally, she suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President shall hold more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added without giving evidence. "We have looked at this number."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've tried this and you've seen that we've been doing it in the last few weeks and that the real press conference is where you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-level representatives.
Single press conferences are practical.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why he was released and sometimes strangely seen before the assembled reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU employees in NHS Scotland to avoid Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and hope for their stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter six months before the departure of Britain from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to defraying the costs of applying for EU citizens who work in the public services transferred.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU on retirement continue to lead to the expected decision of the South.
However, the British Government is also taking steps in preparation for possible scenario departure without agreement.
I know it must be a very exciting time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, however, do not bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and are beneficial for patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warm wish is that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery after head injury
The exhumed Tigers defense from the state of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after he suffered head injury on Saturday 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores' opponent, Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The state's main trainer in Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before the season.
"He came to the outside of the shop and he just hung there," Reed said.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercrombie an external sugarcane and then put it on the plate and prepared for further assessment.
A state official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no "no details of the type/extension of injury" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the red triangle, graduated the first season for the state of Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total steps, which means 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax on the purchase of real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax if they buy real estate in Great Britain, and money will also be used to help homeless people in the new Tory Plans
This action will neutralise Corby's success of the spirit whose aim is to attract young lovers
Increased liability for higher property tax will be paid to persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
An increase of 120 million € per year is expected to be made to help people without home.
Buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on property purchases when they buy real estate in Great Britain, while money will also be used to help people without a home, reports Theres Mayo today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbina's success in attracting young voters with an offer to provide a price-friendly accommodation and focus on people with high income.
The increase in taxation from the purchase of property will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while money will also strengthen the government's efforts to combat sleepless overheads.
The amount added to the current obligation to pay tax on property purchases, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and purchases for the purposes of the acquisition, may reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that up to £120 million per year will be spent on the state average.
The estimates say that new real estate in London buys 13 per cent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which avoids prices and makes it easier for those who buy first, to get on their own.
The composition of the rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, became “the cities of the spirits” just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on property purchase to help more young people to their own home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices too high by taking land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. Mayow to raise quotas from affordable homes to make “no house” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of housing reforms, including rent management and the end of “unusual” transport.
He also wants to increase the power of committees to put new houses in place.
“ I told Loni that I wanted to devote my efforts as a prime minister to the renewal of the British dream so that every new generation could have a better life.
And that means the adjustment of our damaged market with property.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be justified to make it easy for non-member countries and foreign companies to purchase houses just as hard as the hard-working residents of Great Britain.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the amount of sleep without covering over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to run Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says it's his "highest ambition" to become a certain phase of the management of Scotland.
42-year-old Scott is pleased with the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which currently stands third position in the First Lise, only three degrees below the top.
In the summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got value B and it was," said Ross on BBC Scotland's Sports Sound channel.
“But I grew up following Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that is always something that will get me back.
But this opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors in the role of the managers of Sunderland were Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any embarrassment from the consequences of such names in such a large club as he had previously rejected the precedents of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success of this time would be measured for me by the question of whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him back there, but I'd probably be successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross is a career leader for just three years, before acting as an assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped Alla's club to get out of class and transformed St. Mirren from the beginning of the fall to win the title of teachers immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he's got a lot better feeling now than he's ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"They were probably real cruisers," recalls the time when Alla took his life.
“I really believed that driving is more right for me than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, well done, and I used to enjoy suitable heights.
But playing can be boring.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm always going through the stress and pressure of the job, but I'm just having a good feeling in driving.
I've always wanted to be an manager and now I do, I have a feeling that in my whole adult life now I feel the most in my skin."
You can hear the entire conversation in the Sports Sound series on Sunday 30th September on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
The research found that the great time at the point is Saturday at 17:30 p.m.
The summer wave has increased the revenue of British households struggling with problems, but it has increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that households and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who produced final reports, stated: “The stable solar world and more than expected part of England’s World Cup meant that the red followed a similar pattern as the previous red when it increased home attendance by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were even more enthralled.
The decline in restaurant prices by 1.8 per cent in June was even worse in July.
Ladies and gentlemen, drinking bars have still led to the strongest of them, like they've spoiled restaurants.
Gentlemen whose main markets are from food also suffered by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Among the regulated values and bars, the sale of drinks was about 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food stopped by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a member of the leisure activities and hospitality analyst, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of the world.
Time and impact of major social or sport activities are the largest factors in terms of sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, perhaps an annual decline in sales of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in the light of the cost pressures.
The long hot summer can't be the worst time for operators of food companies and time to tell whether the calmer temperatures we have experienced in August bring so much relief."
The total increase in sales in the economy and restaurants, including new open ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decrease in the presentation of the sign.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the British economy, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is the industry measure in the sector.

Reports raised concern that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the complaints indicated that they have a "main" account they know about
Every fifth child – only 11 years of age – creates accounts in social networks that are hidden before their parents.
A survey of 20,000 secondary schools revealed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” on which photographs are shared.
The reports show concern that it comes to the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the complaints indicated that they have an attached "main" account that parents know about and also have a private account.
One mother, who posted on her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site, found that her puber is trying to " rape her."
A study carried out by the Digital Avariness UK and the Association of Headmasters and HeadMistresses Conference (HMC) independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half of whom claim to be carrying out private accounts.
Chief HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and pedagogs can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an Executive Director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated easy athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the sport as those who will benefit from her long-term experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for the Scottish, British and World Athletes community and we are sure that it will be very useful for an athlete in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited that I'm going to be the voice of athletes and I hope I'm really successful and that I'm helping sports in Scotland."
The American who won 200 and 400 yards [200 and 400 m] in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to go after a transitional ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time they show me whether I'm going to get well or to some extent.
It's boring, but I've been able to get full health, I've learned to walk again and I'm having fun today!
Thanks for all the exciting news!"
Receaping milk attracting the comparison of mother to cows shares online views
The producer company has distributed online reviews of advertising that compares mothers to coming cows.
In the context of the introduction to the market of "the first silent portable trailers in the world", Envi published a music video with an emphasis on the freedom that a new trailer gives to mothers.
The four real mothers dance in the hundredth floor with cows on the text: "Yes, I'm coming, but you don't see any eyes" and "If you didn't notice that I had no eggs, they're here with my chest."
The congregation continues: “Push, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I drink my sweet milk.”
The advertising published on the company's Facebook page, however, called for online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 follow-ups and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of which indicated that it was raising light on the "hours" of the dairy industry.
"The very poor decision to abuse the cows on advertising on this product.
Just as we must be pregnant and born to give milk, but they have children taken a few days after birth," says one of the commentators.
Elvie is discharging on her breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Ideally traumatic for the mother and the child.
But yes, why don't you use them for a tooth pump for mothers who leave their children behind?"
Someone else added, "This ad is completely out."
There were also those who defended the ad, and one woman admitted that the fund was considered to be “an evil one. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have ordered my pump here if I were still on the run.
When I respond, I feel like a cow.
Advertisement's a little crazy, but it's something.
It's a genius product," wrote one user.
Others added: “It’s fun advertising focused on mothers who take care of milk (often at work or on toilets) and feel like “crowds”.
It's not a commercial that should praise or destroy the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they are all dancing with discrepancies hidden under the pillow.
The concept of the campaign is based on the fact that many women who take milk say they feel like dogs.
But Elvie's respondent is quite quiet, he has no wires or hats and she's beautiful hiding in the undergarment of her leg, so women are free to move, the possibility to keep the child and even walk when she's resting.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie's respondent is so revolutionary that it deserves a great and attractive market introduction.
By creating parallels between breast-feeding mothers and breast-feeding, we wanted to show the response to milk and all the challenges associated with it and to show the fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new nurse will ensure.
It's not the first time that Lieutenant Elvie got out.
During London's week of fashion, one of the two mother-in-laws of Marta Jacubowski, who used the product right there, appeared.
Hundreds of children of migrants moved quietly to the residential camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has recently increased despite the fact that monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because it states that the rhetoric and principles adopted by the Trupa administration have facilitated the placement of children by means of a procedure.
Most suppliers were traditionally created immigrants without evidence that they were afraid of the danger of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs department official testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of individual unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees did not have previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the sponsors or sponsors' members are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're still in their hold," Mr. Albence said.
According to the staff of the asylum facility, representatives in an effort to work faster on children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the court month before detention instead of the previous 60-day standard.
The composition shall be made public by means of a video conference instead of personally to declare its case as a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the case, have no money for help, will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he or she is to be exposed to fatigue or depression, which may lead to an explosion of contact or escape attempts, the employees of asylum facilities will claim and report reports from the system within the last few months.
Lawyers state that these concerns are raised in the larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, with greater likelihood not overlooked, just because of the size of the device.
They added that the transfer of children to a local camp without sufficient time for emotional training or divorce from a friend could lead to the trauma that many children are now fighting.
Syria announced that American, French and Turkish "occupatives" should be immediately downloaded
During the general meeting of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though he is already in the eighth year of the war in the country.
Moala, who is also a prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian territory, under the banner of the fight against terrorism, and that "it will be controlled by this."
"It must be issued immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem pointed out that “the wave against terrorism in Syria is almost at its end, ” with more than 360,000 people and millions more coming from their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue in "the battle of this holy battle until we free all the Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreigners present."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that are mainly trained by Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
France has more than 1,000 units on the ground of war.
In his release of the Moual refugees, he declared that there were good conditions for their return and accused “some Western countries” of“ spreading non-racial concerns”, which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have mentioned international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They policy what should be purely humanitarian concern."
The United States and the European Union have ensured that no aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protective belt in Idlib's last outbreak has created an opportunity to move on in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement has "explained deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military plan will focus on the Jihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front's organization, with regard to Al-Qaeda, who "will be released."
Ambassador of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meeting of the new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition will be held for the creation of a favourable constitution for Syria and the release of the road to elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for participation by the Syrian government in the committee in the words that the work of the panel should be limited to "control of existing statutes" and issued a warning before delay.
Why the Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won in other elections in 2020 if, as he probably hoped, a number of liberal observers, complaints and scandals had not completed his office as president.
In such a case, it would certainly be "the most undramatic finale of the presidential period in history!"
Until now, there are no signs of the following signs.
Since 2014, follow-up in the main forwarding time was more than doubled by 1.05 million to CNN and almost cost by 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main delivery time, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago according to the Nielsen agency and "The Rachel Maddow Show" to MSNBC on cable television on 3.5 million following the main night news.
"It's a fire that people love because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, manager of the "Designed Survivor" series on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell’s experienced comedy author and series “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club has another theory.
It will be mentioned on the train in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her manager told her that she'd love Trumpa.
Why did she ask?
"He said, 'Because he's funny with him," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story playing in of Washington could translate the future of Roe v. Wad, even though immigrant families can re-connect and benefit the global economy.

Money leads to the most exciting domestic competitions in the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th and 17th years of retirement is experiencing the financial impact of the reorganization of congressional circles that have generated two officials of the office in the fight against the same cross.
This has recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburgh District of the Democratic Republic of the Congo – which has gained another branch in the special election of the Lone on the Iron.
Lamb stands against the other holder of the office, the Republicans of Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the 12th of Pennsylvania, which is firmly covered by the new 17th.
After the Supreme Pension Court issued in January the opinion that the old districts were not legally divided into the interests of the Republicans, the map came to be reprinted.
In the new 17th of June, the competition launched a prudent financial dispute between the main financial parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb has become known in Pennsylvania as a key victory in the followed emergency special elections to the 18th Congress.
This was more than a decade occupied by the Republican and Donald Trump won 20 points in the round.
Politicians give democracies a peaceful leap.
America is considering warning Salvador for China's support, and then leaves
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing under the peaceful pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panay Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was accommodated at the hotel in Panama until the partners had just moved the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
Representatives of foreign ministries decided to call on US Diplomatic Mission Directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent decisions not to know Tchay-wan," said Minister Heather Nauertová in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, efforts were taken only against Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The lessons learned, which included cuts in financial aid and aimed at limiting visas, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of fatalities.
With continued internal meetings, North American and Central American representatives held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity related to similar meetings from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in half of the session, the former representatives explained that they wanted to continue in meetings and effectively complete any accounts for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently planned for half of October, within the framework of a signal which is administratively responsible for meeting the curriculum.
And three US envoys came back quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new news from Washington.
The speaker at the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed with discussions on internal consultations on the terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and has also spoken under the terms of anonymity.
Study Edition
A definitive striker could be the report by Robert Mueller from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr. Trump in the enforcement of the law he is now in the public records of many evidence.
Mr. Mueller's investigation of whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding an attack on our elections.
If there were to be a change in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to report before that authority, just as he is preparing to appear before the voter again, and finally he would be expected by the jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "if" and I do not want to say that Mr. Trump's strike is inevitable – just as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that affects how long suffering will last.
In 1938 the German authorities were prepared to take action against Hitler, only to build and support his Western powers in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We missed out and missed the opportunity to avoid long years of full blood transfusions that followed.
History is about such critical moments that speed up or slow down the unprecedented pace of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump is out of the office of General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, here the man who's leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been shocked by this since the report announced that Lone proposed secretly to play the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times are unexplained.
“How do we react if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. Britta Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of convincing charges of sexual assault and illegitimacy?
And what is the most important thing is that we will vote in half of the functional period for Congress, which will be responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I believe we don't live, and that's the lesson I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the speed vision
Rangers in the fourth quarter of the Rapid Host See that victory over Rakusana would have given them a great hope for the process of the Group of G of the European League in Spain in the Villarreal game earlier this month.
The damage of the knee prevented fundamentalists Graham Dorrance from first appearing in the season until 2-2 with Villarreel. However, they believe that Rangers can use this result as a reflection bridge to the larger thing.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," declared a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the faith that we could do something and we took the point.
Maybe we could finally have multiplied it, but it was probably quite fair.
They were probably better in the first place, but in the second, we improved and we were better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard because the last game has a good outcome.
The long year was quite difficult, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is fine too.
I hope we'll get ready for it now, we'll look forward to the past season and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement.
Although the participants had a clear view of how they should be treated, few people talked to family members about it.
A total of half of the people in the national study reported having spent the price of long-term care with their partners.
Just 10 percent said she talked to her children about it.
"People want to take care of them, but they don't want to take it with them," explains Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance.
You can start with this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare a family to provide care if you do not give them your wishes.
Together with your consultant and your family, try where and how to take care, because these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Get your financial advice: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, you can finance long-term care through traditional care insurance, hybrid life insurance that will help you pay these expenses or through your own insurance using your own resources – until you have money.
Create your legal documents: Stop legal fighting until it goes.
Set up a representative for your medical care, which will be a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that your doctor will keep your expectations open if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Consider, too, the accumulation of full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are executed if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical care and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicine and allergy?
Write these details down to your written plan to be prepared.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
As communications are out of operation, the auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the Doghrea Regent, which is a region north of Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster struck, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Regent of Doghura, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the narrow siege on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Dothria is a narrowing regenergence divided more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the Province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Doghrea.
In the province there is also a significant concentration of nickel, which is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donghau have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 she killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Doghrey in 1996, when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Ocean Circle and regularly comes here to the quake.
Here is a list of some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and prepared 26,000 people across the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquake hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of the autumn.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake struck them on the most vulnerable island of Java in Indonesia and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit Padangu, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people came to life.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the Isles of Mentawai, near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis of 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the country of Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time she didn't form any tissues, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Albanian governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin's candidate, was arrested for the charge of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers Agency, 29-year-old Palin living in the city of Wasilla on Aljašce was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, harassment of domestic violence and arrest.
When, according to the police report, his wife's knowledge tried to call the police to report a certain crime, Palin phoned her.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is held on an unencumbered bond of 500 USD, KTUU's report.
According to the network report, on Saturday he appeared at the court where he declared himself to be ‘very innocent’ when he was questioned.
The fuel is headed by three Class A offences, which means that it could be judged by the year of withdrawal of liberty and for an amount of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B transfer that was punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first thing that Palin has to face with a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported a certain attack on the police.
The case is currently before the Albanian court for war veterans.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, infraction of the report of domestic violence and armed detention in connection with the incident.
He probably hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by a group of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after arriving at the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destruction of thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake hit directly on the surface of the island of Sulawesi, located north of the main Indonesian city of Jakarty.
The social media revealed videos showing the moment of horror.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal claimants require an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death penalty for Sayfulla Saip, who is suspected of surviving a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently carried out an attack on a bicycle train station in the West Side Highway in the fourth Lower Manhattan with the help of the found carrier Home Depot, who set up a biker and a biker.
In order to prevent the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Saip has killed eight victims “soundly” and “soundly” caused a number of injuries – thus defining the terms and conditions of the intention to execute the death penalty under a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the Court's documents, the two figures would mean the possibility of death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipov of 22 criminal acts, including the murder in favour of acts that were usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and the assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The flight required "significant planning and preparation", the complainants argue and describe the way Saip's action was carried out as a thorough, cruel and repeated."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadadve, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlievé, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucca," is hereby mentioned.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court finally sentenced him to death.
The complainant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Finally, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, who were shown to be spying on the Soviet Union during the two years of the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has been present in accordance with the judicial documents during the days and months following the attack of the minimum penalty.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saip's charges, he was told by the authorities that he was inspired by the monitoring of the video of the Islamic state on the phone.
The police also stated that he also requested an increase in the train of the Islamic state in the hospital room.
He declared that the 22 charges were innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were "discouraged" by a decision by the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and reciprocity of life without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," said Patton.
The Saipo's crew had already asked the complainant not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Party, Brexit NIGEL FARGE should be entrusted to the Conservative Party
During today's protest at the Conservative Party's conference, Nigel Farage committed to "mobilising the people's army".
The former Head of the Independent Party of the United Kingdom stated that the policy must, as one of its own envoys Theresy Mayow proposed, feel pressure from the Euro-Sceptics – he should contact the EU directly.
Several Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone announced on his way to Birmingham that Great Britain would now be out if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem faced by Mrs Mayo when she calmed down her ranks, where she suffered a deep shock, was still highlighted by conservatives fighting for service in the EU who joined in a self-defense protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from Chechers during the attacks of Brexit's residents, the Union's residents and the EU's own.
The allies insist that they will continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will encourage Eurosceptics and Laborustists to choose between its package and "chaosem".
Mr. Bone told me that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihulu, where he wanted to go to the Chechers'.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for dealing with Brussels.
"If he were in the head, we would already be out today," he declared.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: "I'm going to make up for Brexit, but we're going to have to hang out on Chechers.
To show his support for the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars in order to listen.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: ,The idea that the British citizens would change their views and want to celebrate is quite misleading."
Conservative stop Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also participated in the event, told reporters: ,I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Checkers is not popular with the general public, opposition will not vote for him and he is not liked by our members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be chosen at all.
Forget about Chechers and start listening.
In a loud message to Mrs Mayow, she says, "Ministerial presidents will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that conservative policies must "get into an unacceptable situation" if they wanted to break their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're standing here today to tell them, we won't let you do it."
In the above report, he added: ,I want our political class, which is on the ground of Brexit's infection, to feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we do not rest until we become independent and proud of Great Britain who will rule on its own."
The people of the Union visited Birmingham during the meantime and then organized two-year meetings in the city centre.
Several activists had transparent Conservatives against Brexit after a week's work began.
Labourist Ambassador Lord Adonis spoke to conservatives about problems with the safety of the party's application after the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who, according to their own words, are able to provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for problem-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a mess.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan is to "really industrialize" the candidate to the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that after November's elections, he would "have a good job as president".
Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future on Saturday at a workshop in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-elect November against the Republican representative Geofu Diekh, who was co-chair of the trumpet campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She felt in the center of speculation that she could set up a dump in 2020.
The action on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at the workshop from the time Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to talk about the Bureau of the President.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and make our broken government, which also means a woman in the highest position."

Russia’s great price: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world’s mystery when team regime gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team regime will play a big role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start and nearly stopped Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two arrests and called Vettel to defend his teammate.
The leader went to the funeral as the first and told Hamilton to get the cars running on the crew's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver entered the deck about later and arranged for Vettela. However, Hamilton climbed out front and in a tight fight, the Ferrari driver had to leave the inside road unattended so that he could defend himself after the second manoeuvre in the third round.
Max Verstappen came out of the back row of the train field and at the end of the first car was on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race because he kept the original pneumatics as far as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimma Raikkon's fourth position.
He finally landed in the dump in the 44th wheel, but in the other eight wheels he could no longer increase speed and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri's been doing great work all week, and when he got an order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and reward are the first two places," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad word of body.
President Donald Trump spoke to Senator Diane Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she was unable to publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of being a candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh with sexual assault.
During a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate Commission, rather than declare that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, opposed and slandered."
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that happens in the last days in Shinar, when you see this relationship when you see the people being angry and angry and fierce and stubborn,” he said.
“When you look at the publication and publication and they will say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you give me that boy?
Remember her answer... you published this document - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Oh, no.
She didn't show up."
Well, wait a minute.
No, it's not," he added and added to that senator.
Feinstein sent Ford’s letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information was not available at the beginning of September – but Feinstein requested that it be excluded from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statement, nor did I publish any information about the case," said Feinstein's clones, as reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
According to all her words, the president, who, in case of a meeting on Saturday evening, said: “I will tell you that this is a very bad thing of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
The President continued in the defence of a candidate to the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment and pointed out that the Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“The decision is to take a lot of back from any available means.
You see this understatement, there's one of them who's hurt who has to go back to the country in order to get back to power and to cormide," Mediaite quoted the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made a five-way fire in the elite league against Belfast Giants won in the Sunday rehearsal in Dundee, which ended in 5-3.
The Giants soon took over the double-ranking leadership thanks to the principles of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned Giants.
Francois Bouchard then compared to Dundee again, and two branches of Lucase Lundvald Nielsen assured them of their victory.
It was about the third battle in the Elitny Lake in the season for the Adam Keefehe team, which took place on Friday in Belfast Dundee to defeat 2-1.
Both teams met in the season on the fourth floor, and all three previous games were dominated by Gigants players.
Two of the first branches came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, to help Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford joined the assistant at Beauvillier's second floor four minutes later.
The first third was strange when Sullivan got home back to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquartt prepared a hole for Cownie who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyerers, Giants went to the cabin for the first stop, only when he marked his second round of dinner at the end of the first three.
Homes were overcrowded and Bouchard was told to recover completely from violent games at 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcorana's joint work later helped Nielsen's second-third first in the game to overcome leadership on Dundee's side and thus the player secured his team's leadership in half the final-third.
Giants who have lost the fourth of the last five games will play another game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The pilot died in order to enable hundreds of people on board the aircraft to avoid landing
The driving flight in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after his death when he watched hundreds of people safely board the aircraft.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a massive earthquake struck the fifth island of Sulawesi, which caused tsunamis.
The following powerful eruptions swept the area and many people remained trapped in the coastal cities of Palu.
But although his 11-year-old fellow Anthony Guanawana Agung fled to save his life, he refused to leave his place in the wild at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on board, could be safely landed.
Then he jumped off the ledge down when he thought he was meeting.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaking on air navigation in Indonesia, Johannes Sirait told the TV channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We were preparing to transport a helicopter from Balikapan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another town.
I'm sorry he died this morning before the knight reached Paul.
"Our hearts have broken this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The Agency responsible for disaster resolution indicated that access to the city of Doghrea, Siggi and Butong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase because many bodies remain unrestrained under the neck and many of them have not been saved yet," said the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the desolation of Palu reached altitudes of up to six metres. In the city they will finish the mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and civil aircraft are bringing aid and supplies into the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said at Sky News station: “Ambulance here brings other bodies every minute.
There's not enough drinking water here.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leading the international Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN station: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to survive, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It's already tragedy, but it could be worse."
Indian President Joko Vidodo came to Paul on Sunday and told the military staff of the country: “I ask you to work day and night and do all the duties necessary for evacuation.
You're ready?" the CNN station said.
This year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplanes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the plane crash in the harbor
The air carrier operating in the port of one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific has now indicated that one person has been mistaken, and at the beginning it stated that all passengers and crew of 47 persons safely evacuated from the landing.
Air Niugini reported in a press report that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling husband.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in the search for lost husband.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requirements for providing details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the aircraft landed in the water while trying to reach the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials claimed that there were seven persons transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in a stabilized condition.
However, what caused the disaster and the exact outcome remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and maritime company reported that the aircraft had arrived in the harbor just before the docking road.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane had reached a very small altitude.
"That was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes further indicated that he and the others were able to get water after a long walk to the emergency exits of the flying vessel.
He went on to say that the deck staff panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers working near the coastal shores helped save the crew carrying passengers on shores before the plane sank to about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
A data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades there have been fatalities at airports with the registration mark of PNG total 111 persons, but no accident has occurred in Air Niuguni.
Analytical describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The complaint ended on Saturday in this case where the husband was again sentenced to the burning of a woman for life in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of his analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed several hours and provided expert research in the field of intelligence analysis.
Analytics for the jury planned a scene using records from the phone number 29 of Quinton Tellis and the 19th-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he got location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was on the night of his death in Chambers' company, which was in conflict with his previous statement, listed The Clarion Ledger.
On the basis of the data from his mobile phone, he was shown that he spent the night with Chambers, that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then he visited the police.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the complainants argued, did Tellis tell the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "Yes, because my car was in Nashville that night."
The other thing is, Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he was reading Chambers' text messages, calling and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
Obajoba will start his final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be reached before the court later that same day.
High Breed: What is the famous hip hop?
Hip hip trio wants to get rid of negative views on this genre by filling his song with positive links.
Capela High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political relations and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the scientific hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently met with renewed appreciation for such artists as Akal and Lowkey in Great Britain.
Another black man?!
The NY trainer complains a couple of times for her challenges after the "rasistic" text message
The trainer from New York complains a couple of times about his discriminatory challenges after she got the wrong text message from her mother, which was marked as "other black" text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared the application to "dangling".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman's mother, the mother of two children, expressed her fear when she found out the first day of her work in 2016 that her new teacher, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"WORTH, THE DESTRUCTION OF COURT," wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his wife.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her a beer twice.
When she got her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman's "anxman" came out to Mrs. Maurice and said that her right-hand coach, who was Afro-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines, put in her New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and Uberem was sent home.
Maurice now complains about compensation for retirement and calls for an amount of USD 350 per day of six-month commitment for which she was hired at the beginning of the contract, even if no contract has been concluded.
"I want to show them that this isn't going to happen," said the Post this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two returned to the fact that they were not racist, but that Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that she could no longer be trusted by those abusers.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
It's definitely not racist.
We're no racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco's Post list.
"But would you believe your child in someone whom you have treated with contempt, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
But come on."
Plasco compared the application to "dwelling" and indicated that his wife had only cared for a child for only two months of age and was in "very difficult situation".
"Would you drive after someone like this?
It's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Even though the trial continues, the court on social media quickly condemned the two for their conduct and logic.
Tellers of Midwife Paddington were afraid that readers were not worried about talking to the bear, showing the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, reported: “It’s difficult to get into the situation of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's very fun to know it, but now that we know the enormous success of the Paddington bear."
She noted that her father, who was working as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write a book on a small floating bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that became "snake" at the time of his death last year.
To Paddington, described as "the most important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was never quite an exhilarating man," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like you had a child who got something that you could really be proud of.
I think he was looking for this view on Paddington's success.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to record all his successes to Paddington only."
My daughter died and I had to tell her on the phone.
After her arrival, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that he does not expect her to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had to call from Nada, where she told me she died in the next two minutes and I had to tell her goodbye.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart moving, gradually lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died a short time later and it was like it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in my head."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now the tragic loss of her daughter, entered the plane with other passengers without giving any indication of what severe trial she is going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head covered, all the time in my sweats.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt a huge understanding of Nado.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Short-term women send viewers to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are spreading the views of the Welsh bridge with inspiring connections and telephone numbers that people can look for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was only 13 years old when he suffered from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was given a young cook with an urgent smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room."
Still, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his immortal body after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of what this will have to do with his life."
Ms. Davis proposed an overview, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are concerned about their friends.
Do not sit still, you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was the flight friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he felt down, or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“We then observed a change in his behavior a few days before the holidays.
It was the worst of them on the Day of Resurrection when the children would open up their gifts, and they would not be able to see anything."
She admitted that her mate’s death was a major tragedy for them, but she had to step aside from this: “This can be done in the family.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on how the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked for – a time-limited investigation – we could bring a little unit into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" because both sides would be buried in the acquired positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to begin the investigation?
Their defense is well timed.
The elections in half of the electoral period are only five weeks away from us on 6 November, and if the Republicans do what is expected to be wrong, this will lead to their major weakening in their attempts to pass on the man who is required to be at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, and he stole from them Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI collects its message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in Senate, which has enabled Vice-President Mik Pence to break the verdict and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea for Kim "lost"
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea since the beginning of the government Kim Čong-Una has fallen seven years ago, says the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Federal Ministry for Unity, stated that in the last year there were 1127 refugees – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further pointed out that there are stricter controls on the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates required by the feeders on the border.
Pchjongjang didn't make any public statements about it.
A large majority of North-West refugees today are being offered to the South Korean population.
Soul claims that 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, with North Korea’s largest border and are easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized passport (DMZ) between the two of Korea.
China looks at refugees as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often returns to them.
The relationship between North and Jihem, which is still in the military state, has improved significantly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchjongjang for talks focusing on the established denuclearization process.
This was done at a historic June meeting of Presidents of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Čong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on the broad conditions of cooperation in the nuclear defence of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and there will be no way to let us fight unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in his speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
In fact, the democratic minority Nancy Pelosís called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that it was inappropriate to serve the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosí made this note during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman ever presented such a theatre, they would call it "hysterical," said Pelosi in his response to Kavanaugh's fourth speech before the Senate Court.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey ford when they were both still in puberty.
During his introduction, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and breathing while talking about his family and his summers at high school.
He also explicitly condemned democracies in the committee and pointed out that their accusations against him were "a major and coordinated attack" organized by liberals who were unable to pass over the Hillary Clinton Prize in presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was willing to oppose democracy.
"I think he has been disqualified by these statements and by the way he worked with the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosí responded with a firm response to the question whether she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh in case of his confirmation, even if the Democrats obtained most of the Sneaming Representatives.
“I will tell you this – if Congress does not tell the truth, then it is not only responsible for the work of the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is currently working,” Pelosí said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Appeal Court . .
Pelosí added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential benefits of Kavanaugh in court by the Act on Friendly Care or Roe vs. Wade, because she was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing of his previous confirmation, Kavanaugh refused to answer the question whether he would return any decision to the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for hysterical, supposed person to come to the court and expect us to just say "Yes, it's superhero," Pelosí said.
And women must rule it.
After the verbal explosions, months and years of drought, it was impossible to escape without a cry.
"We cry when we have a relationship," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “The woman who made me a director and who told me that she was crying when she had a relationship but who created a certain technique means that when she had a relationship and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I have a relationship."
That's how she kept doing it.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked at the office where men dominated men.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“He doesn’t know you have a relationship.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an unwed business on the deck of the Monkey Business ship and had to be taken out of the fight. Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found out that there was no reason why she could not examine her own presidential candidate.
"It was not a well-thinked decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snéhurk and seven trolls."
Because at the time, the campaign had been running for a long time, but it couldn't take steps to get contributions, so it was committed not to be caught if it didn't get 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate only $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was simply convinced by her emotions – as an expression of her gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to get money and focus on volunteers more than on delegations and from the relationship over sex, that she was fully interested in it.
"You might think I was nervous," said Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to her pressure.
“And you may be surprised that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd probably write me on a funeral stone.
"Plakkala"?
Why can it be a Chinese-American business war for Beijing good?
The initial wave of trade wars between the United States and China was exciting and although the battle is not far-reaching, experts believe that there is a gap between countries in a long-term perspective that is useful for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning this year because he considered the Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and coal.
Most of the most significant scalings, however, were reflected in the world's light this week when new prices for the goods were announced for US$ 200 billion (GDP (GB50 billion), which is practically half the tax on Chinese exports to the United States.
Beijing has responded to each, the latest five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of the US commodity.
China has tried to pay the same amount of money to the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would go to the knees.
Although China would like Washington to return to its original wheels, it would mean to meet its requirements. But public detail with American requirements would be quite humiliating for China's President Si in-Pching.
However, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would put an economic output in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have ever made," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia in the tank of the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country of more than seven years of war.
In a speech at the UN Valne meeting, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouele said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal conditions.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country due to terrorism are now fulfilled, as are the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouelem stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in the construction of the affected country.
He pointed out, however, that we would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring outbreaks.
Europe has responded differently to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won in Ryder Cup in 2018 defeating the US team with final score 16.5 k 10.5 at the Le Golf National game on the edge of the problem in France.
The United States has now lost six of its own on the European continent. So it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again received a crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn arrived with his team at 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tournament, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 jackets and left the victory for Francesco Molinarim.
The Italian golf player Molinari then hit all his cars and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best 5-0-0 result since he was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was won by 5 and 4 players from the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olsen from Denmark.
The most appreciated world player, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 with Jan Poulter from England, who successfully graduated his latest Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points won for his career.
"I usually don't pay, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy. I'm really happy to have the food back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He threw a fire on his cousin John Ramp, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 on Sunday in singles.
"I feel incredible feeling that I beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up following this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four savings in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Excellent statistics one of the best players of all time, who got 14 biggest titles, which can only compare with Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who led a spicy golf course throughout the tour.
According to U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after his team’s disturbing findings, he said: “I am proud of those guys who were really fighting.
We really burned Europe this morning.
Actually, we didn't do it.
I'm gonna make up my mind before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're going to regroup and in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee we're moving forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them Captain.
I really need to move.
You've won us."
