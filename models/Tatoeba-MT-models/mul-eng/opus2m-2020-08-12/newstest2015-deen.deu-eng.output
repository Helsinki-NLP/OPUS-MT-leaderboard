The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to establish economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrested 20-year-olds after speeding motorcycle Jagd
A motorcycle was attacked after the driver had driven it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and by Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they saw it, how it left a tank on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the silent signals and went further on the Burgess Road before he landed in the country where the officers lost it from the eyes.
The bike as well as a person who spoke to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal as well as of being unrecognizable driving.
He will appear before the Court of Justice in Karratha on 23 September.
The bike was secured and taken for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel violence in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in two hotels in front of the court because of the rape of women.
George Webster, 28, was heard at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, he was charged with having raped a woman at the Scotland's hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire.
The complaint says that webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, unconscious, unable to signal an understanding."
In addition, it is proposed that on May 4, 2014, a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland will be raped.
Richterin Lady Rae set up the negotiating term for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American idea of labour rights as human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as a citizen.
"As cooperatives die, so do middle-class jobs," said Elison, a democracy from Minnesota and Vice-President of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I congratulate my colleague John Lewis, along with the Citizen Lawyer.
This road break-up law provides workers with equal legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as well as other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-working forces.
The addition of the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade representation in order to appeal before a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or punishment - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But there is certainly no radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, it is the best way to understand what Elison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal propose to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that have been faced by the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have encouraged one country around the world to recognize, extend and maintain labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right of association in an atmosphere.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that military autocraty Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full knowledge that workers and their cooperatives played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and negotiate and act together are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers should be organised and their voices should be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a class which explicitly noted: "The right to create associations to ensure and improve working conditions and to guarantee each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements restricting or restricting this right are null and void; they are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Bureau of the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the General Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "any person has the right to form or participate in cooperation to protect his or her interests."
Since generations Americans have accepted the basic claim that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advises other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans state that the right to establish a company - and that this cooperation should then be protected from collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government agencies.
After these rights have been created in America under decision-making, it is indeed very good to re-direct the American ideal so that the working population must have the right to unite and become members of a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers did not restrict the strength of the nation but increased it.
By increasing the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and has brought the whole nation to an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story reminds us, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights - as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' businesses - is far too short.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America big in the past and break the promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily suspended the law that all operating clinics in Louisiana could be forced to close
On Sunday, a U.S. Federal Justice suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, stating by the lawyer that it was likely leading to the closure of all five operating clinics in the state.
This measure, which was adopted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana in June and was to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors to take up a patient's right to a hospital within 30 miles radius to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors may continue to carry out legal proceedings while applying for such a right.
"The complainants may continue to work in accordance with the law while they are working towards the realization of these rights," Federal Court of Justice John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month a hearing shall be submitted to the judge in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
The decision, which was the most recent in a series of cases against similar measures, welcomed the ruling and said that doctors had gained so much time to obtain hospital notice.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana have a permanent law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the reproductive rights centre, who had complained on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the state to maintain the law.
It was not clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and also applied for the right of administration.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently stated such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional reasons.
Keys to a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics in the state to conclude, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Oestretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that the rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
The opposite is opposed to the protection of women's health, although some also welcome the effects of closures of clinics.
Only a doctor who is carrying out operations in Louisiana has patient registration rights, shared the reproductive rights centre.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more operations, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation for his safety, the group said.
In its argument against the Court of Justice, the representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not be punished by doctors for carrying out operations while their applications for patients were still dependent.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death by iron-stock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have placed a video home for her mother online who died in 2007 of Eirstock cancer.
For women in rural areas in Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from Eirstack cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with Eirstock cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE Study: New medicines may require lung and kidney cancer
The researchers studied women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of kidney cancer, existing infectious diseases as well as the social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, survival rates were lower.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas during the study.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city die of higher risk of iron cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by genologic oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to prevent removals, they suggested that, as a possible help, strengthening the service of doctors involved to allow specialists to provide women closer to their home, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independent of geographical status, gave women a bad long-term life rate and stressed the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, experienced an aggressive form of Eirstockkrebs.
Small household holdings of garden centres
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of households under 35 years, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of dollars per year if today’s young consumers after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Cerneral Group for Garden Products".
The report states that renters spend an average of 55 per cent of their salary spending people with their own home for their garden.
The rise of people living in high urbanised areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting parks and the low garden sizes are other factors that threaten the industry, estimated at £5 billion per year.
In the large area of London, where the share of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the minimum expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society show that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't draw plants.
Guy Barter, head of the RHS, said: "Container gardeners are, for example, very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a turn."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade due to increasing household and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted a better market situation for this year because of the better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement initiated by the opposition policy of Iran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital city of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stolen the state TV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have forced the protesters again from PTV buildings.
The sender introduced his operation for about 40 minutes, but sent it again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a mile away, they delivered themselves with pieces and stones equipped with safety forces.
The police set up trains.
The demonstrators called for Sharif's return, but they let it go.
The country's army therefore has a political solution to the conflict, "without time to disappear and use no violence".
After a meeting in the main district on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more frequently.
Imran Khan's opposition policy calls for Prime Minister Sharif to be involved in Parliament's election last year in May.
The protests were scheduled on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to precipitate Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the most powerful US diplomats in the country to publish a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British Secret Service.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan played the role of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that the most important secret service in Germany had Ankara in the visitor also provided for significantly increased reactions by the Turkish government.
Warnstreik: Heads of Command are safe with consequences for Pendler
The federal warning line of the leader at the Montagabend could also affect the traffic of persons in NRW.
The airport announced for 18 to 21 hours shall cover all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-road traffic;
The main direction of the warning line is freight traffic.

said the president of the German company Lokomotifführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on significant losses.
Regional focus is not given.
The main focus of the warning line is good traffic.
The German railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where they want to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences in particular.
Police chief charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence to the government office of Mallorca for pressure from police and city officials.
The chief of Calvia's police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and barbes owners in the famous Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-General José Antonio Navarro was taken by several business people from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night clubs from Magaluf were held in investigation.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence to the government office for the fight against corruption in Mallorcas on Friday for pressure from police officers and officials in the city of Calviá.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the premise of corruption and were questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the affected night club owners were watching the authorities’ veterinary business have a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the business people to the court.
Let us get our basics out of the game.
We don't have to lose anything.
Magaluf made this summer because of a viral YouTube video international battle lines, in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown who completed 24 men during a sauna tour of Fellatio.
The island authorities have tried to stop the orderly behaviour of an alcoholic holiday in Magaluf by reducing the number of participants in the popular alcoholic drinks.
The Playhouse Club, where the case occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Kneypentour-Organiser Carnage must pay together a fine of € 55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist place Magaluf, which is popular among young British vacationers, is also known for several incidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of breakfast with wet and symmetrical weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRYHLING has protected South Australia from a winter surprise, with strong guards and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
At night until 21 o'clock, further 5mm rain falls on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down by night to Sunday.
The last drop was the result of a series of short, steep eyebrows, including a hole that started about 20 hours ago and provided for nearly 4mm drop in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week for an early dose of breakfast, the city’s temperatures fall again at a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The favorable weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virginia Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m., but it was hit by a wind – a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance – and had to start.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to start at a second landing and finally stopped at about 20.40.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible observers.
Mathies means: Maximum time for large networks
In view of the galluping technical progress that is threatening to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switch controls, our Colonist Bernd Mathies is disappointed with an extremely reliable electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a misunderstanding here: If the cable had not been, in a short time all the listeners would have flown into the house without ever knowing, and that would still be much more retro.
Without it, yes applies to the ecelectronic (electronic?
No, tip errors: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness of today's electric shock is bought from tomorrow - ageed.
And for example, whoever has a TV in his living room today says he's basically on TV.
Why are these considerations?
Because this week the demand for Ifa on the power tower again leads to our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The Laie, who used to be blindly controlled by washing machines and CD players today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him by an unstoppable expert voice: "Connected Home, Wearabbles, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us press sets.
Yeah, it's still going?
What should you talk to people who are apparently willing to spread such a banner?
In fact, it's been about 20 years, especially since we've been missing our house.
To order the Joghurt itself so that the firemen will inform us at the time of the holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we from the office from the air conditioner on our regular arrival ...?
Yes, however, this implies a climate setting.
But a dream will certainly come true at the very first: We have our arm's length, she says, "Suggese!" - and at home the dust grower leaves.
Come on.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods disappear," says one industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamman sends the weather report and the data brightness shows how long the pizza still needs in the back pocket, but it doesn't use anything because we're in the station.
From the daily practice we also know: If a modern device is used really urgently, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exposure.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-protection rooms, while rockets and murder committees were held in their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza, while the area was occupied by the fighting.
The school start brought joy and anticipation to the communities drawn by rocket shells in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggle are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers of the "Passosh" Children's Garden, which was hit by a rocket, were removed before the school of Granatsparter came out of the walls and sideways.
"We've been a little scared, but we're upset," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt like "a little funny" to go back to school.
"It was difficult times, and we haven't even gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until the last week of the war, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to escape safeer areas from Gaza and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Morsegranate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education shared that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Your children were admitted to other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is severely marked by the Palestinian occupation.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire your knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unprecedented arms stand last Tuesday.
The weaponry provided an immediate end to the struggle; however, important problems remained unresolved, as the demand for Hamas after an Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza was lifted and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the destruction of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during the wars.
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were killed according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contends with these data and estimates that at least half of the deaths are combatants, however, there were no specific locations for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza burned 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or damaged thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were built in temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue to fight, the educational authorities spend the week in the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will be reopened soon so that we can learn more, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said 13-year-old Muhammad Amara, who is now living in a school in Gaza City.
After selection in cases: CDU-Vize Strobl asks NPD procedure questions
In view of the loss of the vote of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl spoke for an end to the ongoing NPD procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should end.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, also head of the CDU country in Baden-Württemberg, "Leipziger People's Journal".
This is a happy development in the right direction and a development that will bring me closer to the result of the political struggle against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was divided very close to the five-percent hierde on Sunday.
A first strike for a ban on the party's right-wing party was broken in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also been reported in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council received a new application in Karlsruhe after further preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day do not agree.
Hamburg: Rare for new refugees
In New Zealand refugees are now being transferred to cells.
The central shelter for refugees in Hamburg is located all night long.
The internal authority has now set up three cells of the Red Cross.
The regional policy was first informed - they are not interested.
"These hauruk actions continue to ensure that citizens and district politicians are not able to contribute constructively to the human supply of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, president of the Greens Group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party calls for the Harburg district administration to provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be transferred into the three cells.
Reasons for filling in the original seizure are the pressure of asylum seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient places in consequence facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the greatest winter rise in seven years, showing a well-known index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for owners in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
By this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double as high as the increase in 12 months until August 2013, but increases were not distributed equally across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne are pursuing a double market.
The figures from RP Data show that domestic prices in Sydney have increased by 16.1 per cent in last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increase by five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit by the cuts at state expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that with the breakfast rate now in the next month there would be an increase in the real estates that would be subject to "a real test" on the market.
"If you take into account the continuing high auction rates, a general rapid sales rate and the continuous low interest rate, it is likely that the ownership impressions will continue to increase in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statement of the executive director of Peer Medau and certifys it "as a field lord".
The school's style is not this, it's in the message.
This is how the Medau family has already been informed "Mette Juni orally about the university's intentions.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that there is no "preventions or even decisions" in the plans, but there are "preferences".
Also, the construction of the narrow road in addition to the closure was less dramatic than that of the Medaus.
It was from a nine-metre wide street and is not the talk.
It's going down to the current position of 5.50 meters, that's a meter wider than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school parking areas will be used in the future only by students of the university will not be allowed to pass by Pötzl.
It will not be parked at all because it can be solved intelligently as in other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
The children's mountain range, which is located on the ground and which would lead their journey to Parkdeck before their home, should "not be affected" according to the High School President.
There is much more to think about "that it is not only about childcare, but also about the people who are involved in moving to the Friedrich Street Street and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So much more is involved than in the particular interests of Mr Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental crisis, with the construction of the street, would have been entitled to "lost one of the few naturalized spots Coburgs", "the reader can decide for himself".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the constructive development of the University by 2020 "and discuss the significance of the new conclusion in this regard".
Last week, Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crisis about the plans of the University.
Therefore, the access to the new park deck should not be like the campus and the Friedrich Streib Street, but the Medau Mountains.
For this reason, the narrow road had to be constructed twice a mile.
According to the Medaus statistics, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would slow down.
Of about 2000 vehicles every day, the talk is.
To date, you did not want to go out on the project.
Glandorf meeting from Handball National Mission back
Holger Glendorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the German listist SG Flensburg-Handewitt introduced health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has been cancelled over several months.
It's time for me to hear the signs of my body and finish my career in the National Army," the World Master shared on his Facebook page from 2007.
So he goes with a balance of 167 country games and 576 tournaments for Germany in international peace.
Because the famous backspace player wants to go to Torejagd for the Championships League winner from Flensburg for some years, he is no longer available to the new Federalist Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the islander who announced his career on Tuesday for the country's games against Switzerland, Glendorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me just as they are interested in my long-standing players and my followers.
But for my club I would also like to be available in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary which do not allow the current double taxation.
The left-hand side had to fear his career after a passenger infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been treated by German Handball Bundes (DHB) team doctors with a cortisone splice that later had solved a severe respiration.
One notation and two other inputs followed.
Glandorf then had announced a complaint against the men's doctor, who had ended the austroposition with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national teamwork go to no body without fear.
I have some health facilities that I can't ignore anymore.
Following the three short-term operations of infection, in 2012, I never received my blood pressure correctly.
Here are some other disturbing complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that I can control my head, but I can't cover my body," Glandorf said in his interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be in absolute need.
"When all the strikers come out, I'm always ready to talk," said the two family fathers to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on the years in which I can still play handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become very shy as regards my health.
After my career, I would like to be able to go at least one step straight away.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the 2014 win of the Championships League, he held the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured with Felsburg the European pocal of the Pocalsies.
Germany's economy collapsed by 0.2 per cent in the spring
The crises around the globe have broken the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter.
This was shared by the Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only consumption lived the economy in the spring while the investments returned.
The external trade also brought the conjugation.
Thanks to the strong annual ceiling for the first half of the year, a total GDP plus 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Munsterland-Mooiste", which was first led by the Burgmanns town on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "Fiettenfarer" on Sunday.
The largest railway association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Munsterland Mooiste".
This is the largest railway tour across the country, the railway paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants thanked Jos der Hueren for the organisation of this tour through the country.
Published in various technical journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from the light and are at night at risk to take part in this journey.
We also want to learn more about this kind of country," the train drivers rejoice over the route through the streets of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the Association of the Protection Brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace road" through the city over the wall, where the start was also successful.
Further led the route, which was written for three different categories, towards the Lord's wood over the Boepping mountain towards Coesfeld and about Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On the route of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitudes, 120 kilometres with 1475 altitudes and 145 kilometers with 1775 altitudes, the bikers prove their good condition.
They were assigned along the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos der Hueren and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the achievements of this bike event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all the participants.
The organization died without problems and there were no negative events," says Heinz Lölfing, a positive episode of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer expected, which was probably at the bad weather forecasts and at the morning rain.
"We see ourselves again in the year 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," the trainer promises to return to Münster and the organizers plan a new flag.
Konstantin Weekers Free honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has led Constantine Wecker, songmaker, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought festivals, the Münchner born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter was introduced by an appropriate song text.
And he is honest in this: he does not allow human weakness from ononia as a Gymnasiaist to bring about the burden of drug abuse and drug abuse.
Also, to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wider space also takes abstracts, but so important concepts: love, soul, ego, which is now spirituality - all he tries to go on the basis of very philosophical but also very personal ways.
And he also expresses his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - as well as how the music not only touched him (the opera lover became a solo and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Last of all, Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also brought about the ascetic monasteries, which are created by "subtraction", as he says, "when you leave everything unnecessary".
However, among all the high-spirited views there are also short anecdotes on the ground: some of them in a local where Gis used to drive a tree.
He's honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
I never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Japanese immigrant family in Dudley in the Middle East in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with live melody.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to get to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Stop the force.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brother Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went into the cage with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I've never had such a conversation with him.
A major part of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a gallery in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he gained an insight into how life could have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, bored, deep styky labyrinths with flameblows and smoke and lots of noise.
My father was just sitting in the yard earlier and then slowly listened to him sing as he started singing because he was able to wash the dishes from his head.
When I lived there, it became clear to me that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my interest in him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father didn't kiss me, he didn't say "I love you."
As soon as my mother gets worse at the end of her life, we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Don't worry about me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That led to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "They must be radical.
So I went through this fitness kit and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
No one likes Carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been agreed by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the riots, and then Fence of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comedys who have fulfilled their business life.
He started working in a factory when he was just 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitationd people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was for a very long time the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient white history machine while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "black-headed", Henry led his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wanted something to happen, but I didn't realize I did it.
It was a unique, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on rice projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old light wave of British television" was also a "great parody black people."
Through the introduction of figures that were both inspired by the British black culture and celebrated, Henry worked in the eight players at an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as chef Garreth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chief!.
Advertisement, documentary, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What do you do as next, Len, because it feels like it's just like you're just making time or just sitting on the table?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first consequence is about Shakespeare.
I was usually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mainly for a domain of the middle class, white in strawhouses and a coal head in front of the inside.
So I was very worried about it.
All we interviewed for the show were Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Think said "You should try it again.
Don't do anything wrong if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare like that.
Henry brought up 20 lines from Othellos last talk for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt like I could make it.
It was almost as if someone had put my head right on my head.
"That's why it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The tests were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he's in the comedy of the screams.
Suddenly I was in the national theater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to keep the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to be over 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the tour guide announced that the presentation continued as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You're playing in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fans was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
That also came true, so it's like a big shield of the gods who say to me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONERNED voice.
So I'm staying.
I really love it.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been triggered by humorous explosions, while he has always been imitating people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're looking for it all the time, you're going ahead of a wall.
I sometimes start living in Apollo when I like it, but I don't care much as much as I used to.
I'll ask him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a director who helps me form a start, a part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to say it again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like a actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Scythian Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-Anhangers had spent central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
The trip to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports about a traffic accident in the capital.
According to the online issue of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthhi called for measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened the paper with a further scale of the conflict, its requirements should not be met.
The Scythian Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-led Yemen and demand the return of the government.
The Huthi people's tribe has been occupying the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have made protest camps on the great route to Sanaa.
In the countryside there is always a bloody fight with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Offices to Entrepreneurs
Kenya has started registering all state officials biometrically to remove "remunerated" from the government's accounts.
Staff members who would not register themselves in the next two weeks would no longer pay a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive payments from the public service after their decision.
President Uhuru Kenyatta made a commitment to combat corruption in the public service at his office in 2013.
At the beginning of a test this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month lost payments for "remunerated" and other abused financial practices.
The government suspects that holders will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or left the public service, Wandwa Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded in a government message.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be deleted from the list of records, continued to hear the announcement.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also clarifying the list of staff at both levels of government - thus eliminating "priests"," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal against the artist Helge Achenbach is first brought before the Court on 11 November.
Five inheritances of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi Gründer Theo Albrecht, require 19.4 million euros damages from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That was shared by a judge on Monday.
In the textbook it is that Achenbach has engaged in the purchase of works of art and timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht’s purchase prices higher than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed provision was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased for 121 million euros value items for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in debt, 23 of which he was the head of debt.
Since then, Manfred Richter has been known as many Peter Housekeepers and Kolllbacher from his time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his efforts to see people in school.
The snowy peak is the most famous mountain in the Riegenge Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Northböhmen, today Trutnov.
He has already been interested in the teaching profession after four years.
A year later, the Southern Germans were appointed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern - in the Gutterwagon.
That's how it hit the judge in the Upper French Sechendorf.
The teacher's training took place in Bamberg.
In this case, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next train station with the train to Bamberg, where he had to walk three kilometers across the city and go back to school at night.
After two months, Manfred Richter entered a Red Cross home in Bamberg, with up to 15 fellow students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he performed the first and in 1954, three years after the second state exam.
Since Superfranches had no free place for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fruulein-room" was his first "service apartment" in the school.
In 1958 he worked in a three-room apartment next to the school in the newly built classroom.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school band and five in Petershausen.
Since the year 1968/69, these were collected in Petershausen in today's Council.
When the school was founded indersdorf, only the primary school remained in the area.
To avoid a relapse in the smaller school now, the then Rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew up, and thus the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's building, which was extended after a direct pension in 1997.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who also made it possible to build an advertising space at Community costs and at the 1997 expansion of source rooms, although this was not possible in accordance with the School Building Guidelines.
"The Mayor of the City of God was very good at school," recalled Richter grateful.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a reference to a schoolmate on justice and justice: "You must never forget love."
"You have to give the children two: wings and wings," says 84-year-olds today.
And he had to experience, "This doesn't always work out." Whether he's just thinking about his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Director Tun was sometimes unconventional.
If the disciples complained, they did not receive any work of punishment from him and were not persuaded to sit next to him.
At the expense of the community, the judge had created two pairs of boxes and allowed the two contractors to act against each other, even if it was supposed to be a veal.
For the sake of the school, judges as a rector made a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partial judge after his retirement to apply at least 1996 as a last candidate on the CSU list for the Community Council.
However, the judge was chosen at six places and attended the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOR 700 bicycles are located in Bad Salzhausen's Corps and Shots between stops
If Ridler is making his tour in Bad Salzhausen or shots, that's nothing special to him.
On Friday, however, only the number of missing persons was impressed: the 700 participants of the hr4-roudour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the Bad Salzhausen's basement and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radels and Celebrations on Rediscovered Roads Between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel, where they met a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the Radlers took the first stage, 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then to shoot in the attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was in Bad Vilbel with the bike, were welcomed by the owner of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Swing-Doöring.
To refresh bodies and minds were all prepared for good things: The rural women from Ranstadt and Neander-Mockstadt had 85 bluches of apples, zwetchens, strawberries and cheesecakes that miraculously fed the weary knights.
"Such kitchens can only hold women," praised a participant from Aulendibach, while he ordered another piece.
At the time of the tournament, Geisz-Nidda could create cold refreshments.
The "Duo Bravo" was attended by visitors with famous tunes from operas and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman handed over a head massage by his partner: "He earned it, finally he reconfirmed already broken railway lines today."
For this reason, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed on the bridge before the Reporter Rainer Janke's drink show and took advantage of the opportunity to rent on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
The chief of promotion, Tobias Hagen, since the first hour of 2004 as tour leader, was able only to get a short walk, but he had plenty to do with the technique in front of the site.
His pickup pressure, in which he communicated through three phones and a function device with his staff and the 15-headed motorbike staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and reported, also required a check.
"The majority of participants are from the Rhein Main area," he said, "but also from Giesten or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants shall be based on some of the available overnight capacity.
In Category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
Of course, the bikers had a good impression when they woke up in half an hour and said, "Shut!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they won the award.
The group was forced to take a short break after the shocks arrived.
But at night the bikers were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the regime of the Scotten Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festival environment and, of course, were prepared with flammable, well-fried dairy cows.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC president Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, as a member of the board of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three showed their joy over the "many operations in swords".
DJ Tobias Hagen subsequently released the dance pool.
The opportunity to swim in the open sky was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests were more and more people who were moved by the good voice as well as by the great scar of the driver.
On the second day, the train drivers stood at the stations Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the restrooms - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the athletes again entered Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police officers were arrested for "infraction" against the government
In total, 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "injuriousness against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the prisoners are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers in last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they reportedly founded an organized criminal union and had dialed telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her initiative as part of the activities of Islamic Spiritual Fethulla Güllen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools were opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk took his daughter to school.
There he shared with wait journalists that not all schools had opened up to him, but that he had decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not at all peaceful across Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian population face has to fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, speaks Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that children will be given a education that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, where children wear hidden blankets, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud breakout from the banking world, media management and the interior circle of the tour party.
And she's got her own front experience.
Her career began at the world management consulting company Bain and Co., where she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was the president of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the top posts of the company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Your recovery probably amounted to nearly 1 million £.
Your political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne by David Cameron, the former president of BP when she looked for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the consultant of the cabinet.
Her husband is an ex-Tory member of the Council.
In May I described the position of the President with a broken neck.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: on the first floor of your own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This provides for a almost insatiable duopol which requires a comprehensive reform.
But what new presidents would be willing to risk, join, touch on everything and accept an institution which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps he himself is doing his job.
It's a difficult task.
And if this is not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status over.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the subsequent processing of licence fees for the BBC is linked to special risks.
For the estimated amount of £145.50 per year, the British public is going into the world’s most secure media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it achieves 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 cents a day.
And it seems that the BBC is going up on the popularity scale again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The sight and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news reports today on my phone and see programs that have been lost later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and noted institution.
She needs a considerable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says the above-mentioned tweet was not authorised
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained an outstanding comment on the democratic district lawyer who is at the centre of a criminal complaint against him because of the abuse of the office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which deleted the previous one.
A tweet from my account that wasn't authorized by me.
"I'm innocent of the tweet and I've deleted it," it said in the post.
Perry's staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account were published, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavourable picture of the district lawyer Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned for drinking at the tax in April 2013.
Perry set up a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return what could be a complaint against Perry - the perhaps 2016 presidential candidate - led this month in Austin before a grand jury.
The text of the tweet says: "I don't always drink with the three-fold acceptable alcohol... but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he throws it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehberg's office was not entrusted with the investigation of the Grand jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a government official from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry complains about not guilty and calls the complaint a political trick.
His high-class team of jurists called on the judge concerned to reject the complaint and argued that the law which was passed against the most powerful governor in the history of the state of Texas was inconclusive.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is established in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - refused to return as Lehmberg.
This Veto provided for a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed the election in Iowa during his presidential candidate 2012 as a fifth, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo from his youth in the vicinity of a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent contractors has shown that the housing market in southern England has been "repatriated" to a normal level.
Owners in the capital were very pleased and subject to enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has been restored to normal operating levels since the 2013 ceiling" and added that it offers a "stable operating environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the
According to information from the Castasteram Office, prices in the city area have risen by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, priceable and student offers rose around a fifth last year and dropped at the end of April at the 423,000 £.
However, in recent months real estate property in London has been less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been denied by introducing new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "will tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate maker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger credit lending arrangements were presented, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year both in real estate sales and at prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage clearance in July, which also means that the real estate market cools.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 by down 3 per cent on the basis of a now deteriorating home price.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has been back for about a quarter of a year, according to the Maker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a property in the capital city for Berkeley is a blessing, as the corresponding amounts for the sale of terminals amount to more than €2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product in the best places has remained stable and as a result, the sales of the term have also remained stable."
In June the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new owners in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual tax result increased by 40 per cent to 280 million £ per year, by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion £.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual tax result at £450 million.
Berkelay shares were fixed on the following Wednesday in London Trade at £ 23.96.
Photograph by Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscarver.
Photo by Oscar Presbyterian Jennifer Lawrence was published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "masterlist" of more than 100 stars.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker about "elective destruction of the private sphere".
The authorities were informed and followed all those who took the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly created by a hole in the online iCloud storage system by Apple. The alleged "masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are true, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private area of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the "iCarly" and "Victorious" , however, argues that it is in the photos about pictures of her hands and second "These so-called pictures of me are GEFALCHT, people.
We're going to start at the same time. *The game is meant*.
Bizzfeed reported the late Sunday that a speaker of Popstar Ariana Grande detached the truth of the alleged photos from her.
exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's high-end new novel about love and the letters "J".
When they float, you could best describe it, they slowly solve themselves like a cardboard that you've left standing in the rain.
On occasion a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distanced, and perhaps something short-lived.
And then he was protected by his hand.
Kratzbürstig knew him.
He was as stupid as Igel, yeah.
The last sacrifice of this stalwart was a just starting sacrifice, which was more promising for a slowing down of the only length of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a delicately narrow beauty with uncooked hair and a glowing heart from a village on the Norse Island, which was even more remote and ugly than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older escort to the south, which held the keverns for her aunt, who had gathered a piece of land in a warm but paradise valley with the coming name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The roses were beautiful, in the bathrooms were still spinal cord, nozzles had left their traces on all the windows and believed they belonged to everything, and the garden was guarded with unkroat, which looked like huge ice caps.
It was like the house from a child market, both dangerous and provocative, a garden full of secrets.
Author's portrait: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the long list for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had put hand in hand with Ailinn on the broken beds in high grass and enjoyed an unusual hot spring afternoon. Both had been in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and related news, when the sight of her crossed legs reminded him of an old, forgotten black entertainer whose father liked to play in closed roles in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their pure aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played at the console.
No prohibition - Nothing was so correctly prohibited - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolated, as the word has been obsolated.
The general taste created what had never been allowed and rules, and how people in books had chosen from tellerwasher to millionaire monuments, cookbooks and love novels, they chose to dance at music.
In the Euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to beat a big foot in a grave-commic Serenade Ailinn.
Ainn doesn't understand that.
"That was a famous song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically placed two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was a child.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't very funny at the time.
He knew this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz became, even though he wasn't directly banned, not played.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was just a place for a single "win" in life.
People wanted to be absolutely sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
The mind too.
His impartiality made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressive.
Although he was 10 years old without being part of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
In her old age she probably couldn't remember a time when the pop singer wasn't black.
Again, no laws or restrictions.
A conformity company meant that each element of this company was grateful for the principle of group membership - thanks to the fact that it was clear from the delivery room.
People with afro-caribic origin were suitable for maintenance and sport, so sing and race.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were entrusted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish Community was concerned about the canalization; what was left of the Greeks, struck Teller.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levants whose grandparents had not left the country as quickly as they were willing to do, when ES GESCHEHEN was afraid of being charged with fires, even fearing that the flames would be the next to be destroyed - had opened up labneh and Shisha fire-resurers, were worried and were depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only been listening to Balladen, it was difficult for Aileen to understand how the misleading words, which the Keveren had just introduced, could make you disappear.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really misleading," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never taught anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the trusted garden gave him the tragic feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the scarring of the huge cold leaves.
Ainn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He meant that it was a jux, but he was willing to put two fingers back on his lips at the time.
She already thought he was something special.
"It seems funny to him," he said instead.
She accidentally protected her head and closed her eye.
There was nothing else to see in the whole world than her uncooked red hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she said without any conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're bothering me.
You look really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ass, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ass is too fat?
Do they hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the dumb song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your fat ass are exactly the reason why you fell for me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perversity.
That doesn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble, because he did not have his father with the soothing charm he needed to deal with the inferno in white.
Maybe his father wanted to be nice too.
Maybe he wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ainn Solomons became red and got out of her bed, the console ran around and covered the wine they had drank.
Holunderflower wine, so drinking was no excuse for him.
In their formation they seemed to sit like palmedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel sorry for you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him both because of the unnecessary indifference of his words and because of the fear shown in her eyes when she lent herself to him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cream ocean came up here like there on the U.S.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and sadder after THE WAS GESCHEHEN WAS WHEN it was their past as smugglers and beachmen, were always ready to raise their hand against a woman who rejected or humiliated them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown you a thick faucet if they hadn't woken up!
She first knuts - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-exhaustive love balls from the console - she first used them and then beat them.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary violation, as Knutschen himself already represented an act of violence.
Ainn Solomon gave him a sign through his body.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt sorry for herself too, but she was surprised by the weight of her grief.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They couldn't do it.
She looked at him as he walked away - like a room on the top floor her companion told him about it - a man, complaining about something he himself complained about.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some of her hands had lifted against her.
A man turned away from her, turned his back, humiliated, defeated, without a fight spirit - why was it a vision she seemed to know well if she could not remember at one time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Irene looked at Solomon on her feet.
A few years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent 32-year-old researcher in the order of Offnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public polling, worked at a short debate on the continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country in which they were reduced if they were not expected to be eliminated, taking into account the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has been done a lot, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to undermine the aggressiveness of a people who have led thousands of wars and have won most of them, especially in the distant corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet spirit of human friendship has been historically disturbed by the high-ward church towers between the hecks.
But some of these characteristics appear to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the less the suffering it continues to rise.
The population is prone to hear sentimental dances, is prone to stories of overwhelming difficulties and insists on believing in the ancestors of marriage and family life, but not only does the former rheuness hold the rural communities as well as our urban additions firmly in hand, but there is also room for a new and lasting struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to transfer," said her mentor, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also need to ask: Are you atheists?
"I think I don't have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and to refuse to speak.
Feminist?
Again, Sweige.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a free job.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and worthy of praise, can sometimes distort the results as you have suggested.
You have obviously benefited from the church itself, and these things that you call "sustainable" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to work on it, what is good is, if it is bad, as if it had happened yesterday, it would have meant to take the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked at himself while Rabinowitz spoke.
After his head, a LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the Councils that Offnow had distributed to the country in the last four centuries or longer.
You laugh at their neighbors, you appreciate their partner, you listen to ballets, you visit musicals, you use your phone, you talk, you explain, you listen to, you agree, you apologize.
Speaking is better than weed, the spoken word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand where you want to go out," replied Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her predecessor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we are, how we form ourselves.
My concern is that we will find ourselves without warning how we can repeat the mistake which is at all the first to what is done when it is done.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we leave our forest and our mysteries.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to be patient with an angel.
"They're going too far," he said, "if you call actions "false" which our parents may or may not have done.
They will also go too far if you say that they had released their "Wut" and their "Mister" to "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind anyone in your position that we speak not of "we" and "other" in the understanding of the past as in the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of order, that's all we know.
"From him, if we are honest to ourselves," he warned, "no part of society can claim to have good conduct.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened is happening.
That was it.
We don't have to say anything about this anymore - we're a bit of a team.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, so no debt must be charged if such a remedy is appropriate and if there is a way to pay it.
But what happens to the past if we don't learn from it -
The past will make us forget it.
If I can say something about it--
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramids collapse.
"I'll think of her report," he said and fired her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was transferred by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, was driving in a kind of "brutal wood" on the footway.
There are cases.
Lesotho-Military said there was no state strike; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state war on government power and said that they were against police officers who were accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and shared that the country's army was surrounded by its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats.
Military speaker Major Ntle Ntoi said that there is no state authority in the fact that the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics" whose armed forces are led by the police.
"What happened this morning was that after he had received several secret reports from the defence forces of Lesotho, the Stasi acted, that there were some elements within the police that really wanted to arm some of the political, political young fanatics who were soon to fix terrible damage," he said against Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monela said that the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed that the government has gone through violence, all reports indicate that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs for a state party," he said.
Speakers of the soldier of Lesotho shared on Sunday that the soldiers returned to their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during the absence of Thaban.
Thabane shared his belief that because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country, he became a target.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Taliban parliamentary meetings due to the changes in its government.
He said that his actions had not been infinityed by the government, otherwise accusing him of being guilty of wrongdoing.
Production in the eurozone on a 13-month scale
The increase in production in the eurozone was slowed down at the lowest point in August of the last 13 months, so a careful study was conducted.
The final market sales management index of the producer company (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, following a stand of 51.8 in July.
There is an expansion of over 50.
New contracts returned and factories experienced an ever-increasing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with the slow recovery of the euro area and for declining inflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB's Head, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week whether it is attracting a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those taken by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the frustrating effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, a leading economic scientist at Market.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern as well as the departure of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth movements in the key industrial mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer satisfactory," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline of industry is likely to prevent the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the sales management index of the production business in the Eurozone since August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Employees in the eurozone find life very difficult now, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase insecurity in many countries under the increasingly difficult conditions.
These increased uncertainty have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some contracts will be delayed or even broken down, especially large orders.
He said it would be "always more likely" that the ECB would finally have to start a kind of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The Tenth anniversary of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible oppression of the school, as the children still suffer.
Over 1,000 people from Chechnya militias were admitted to a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that the world was shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died in the Green Room.
Just a decade after the final siege of the school of Beslan, 334 people, including 186 children, were warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine that had survived the night before a new apocalypse.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, they were arrested and killed, which seemed to be the worst of all evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in the Netherlands, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst earthquake.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died in the Green Room.
We found surprising young people who have overcome opposition, although the memory of this terrorist hero will be followed for all time.
Your greatest hope?
That war, which now seeks the Ukraine home - and in the child as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed during the trial to go back to the school hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famously when she tried to climb back to the collapsed school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were held for death, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should run my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back here looking for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I was afraid I'd have to be operated again.
Some granaries are still in my nose.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help people how you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says in battle.
"That's what happened to me, and it can't be changed.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remind myself of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future class cameradin Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the deposit will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our tears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to something like this not to happen again.
The young man who fled through the cave cave, in the opinion of his mother, was dead
It was his first day of school (Russia goes to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day imprisonment in his mother's arms.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom has told me that I'm going to stand by when there's an explosion and hold their hand."
After an explosion he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Go."
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the road a beautiful little child, caught it by his hand and flew through a bullet hole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out of the arms, said: "Then he told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was beaten outside and with injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in the belief that her son had died.
And after her assembly she said: I am sure that I will be happy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in here and surrounded me.
It was later flew to London (from the newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Bernardo's Children's Championship from Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow up in my memory.
I still know I'm gonna shoot all my toys right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played in court with, and they didn't get it out.
We never said they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially at the game stores where I could find everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends experienced.
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop thinking about it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer under the greys," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the seizure, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers living on her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London won when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wanted to call Cherie and you could just say that 10 years ago, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the damir and I have helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borsch and invited them to all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kellers in a restaurant. So he shot them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war is going on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and still are killed.
They're just like us.
I think that for many of the war it is part of the news they hear when they are late or something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
This has become great and is a very gentle and quiet young man, he is not aggressive or rebellious at all.
He's not looking for money, for example, he's not overcharged by the previous Greens.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's got six good friends from the class and they go to the sports hall and sneak around there.
When he was younger, he looked down - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face hanging from us for hours.
Not sleeping. His eyes were open.
I also remember how he kept all his weapons and other military instruments. It is now 17, bigger than I am, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I got up after the explosion and came on my feet, I looked around and looked at the holes around me, with all the parts of the body around me.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hole.
"I remember cleaning him up, "Damiir, walk, walk," but I was so sure he didn't listen to me.
But he's heard it and he's gone.
And that's how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyn, 17
The young man whose terrible image was taken after the possession of the symbol of Beslan's grey
Trust: The Beslan survivor Georgi Lyn with his mother Fatima after the 2004 deposition, right image of Georgia today
His bloodthirsty face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechnya terrorists shot down his class cameras.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbaric of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had hired him for his first day before she was fired to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists beat him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgian was able to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been here for a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will forget that I promise you.
Finally: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attacks and was confirmed as a status (right).
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school this day so much that he said he wanted to beat his teachers.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this status of the late Georgian in San Marino.
Georgik doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden from us at home in the bookstore.
I understand this, but I also believe that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to these pictures.
Georgie says today: "It's important that things never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever experience the truth.
People are constantly searching for such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world is going to be pretty scary.
"I can't understand how it is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need thousands of years to forget it a little bit.
It touched my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a couple of albums due to the seizure, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were murdered.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when it comes back on September 1.
I want my old childhood friend Tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't join me.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikakakákáz.
I'll be heart surgery.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgian Fanijew, 20
The young man who survived, though he was caught in the foot of a killer terrorist
A miracle: Georgie Fanijew was arrested during the arrest of a killer terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was arrested in the sports hall and next to the bomb that had been planted at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret substance, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the seizure.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say it doesn't agree.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then I really felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - next year - the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I'm losing consciousness.
I will never go back there again and don't ask me to show you where I've been set in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgii Fanijew today, with a photo from the hospital after loading on the laptop
My pain is unpleasant and I bring him with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm good physically.
I should be careful with my broken neck, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg.
I have my records, including the medical records, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to chickens".
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children of my experiences.
Of course, children should not know anything about it and should not be misled by it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse if the anniversary comes back.
I'll go to the holidays to remember.
I know Georgie won't go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been given back to me.
It stays in us.
George is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this if one supports something like this.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his nose.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't run any sport.
I'd say he'd overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the concentration and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and they were dearer to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is about the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about whites who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can't believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how could it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are sorry, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and still many have been killed.
If we could just take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby who was so caught up by a special employment command in security
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special service command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the graces at all
The world was impressed in 2004 when the baby Aljona was brought into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go but kept their 30-year-old mother in her pregnancy, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, disappeared, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murder massacre.
Her father Ruslan recently remarried and married his new wife Swetlana, a little girl he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the torment and is raised to an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a young friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of having girls pass through the walkway in five
A 78-year-old man is standing before the court because of the passing of a three-year-old girl on a walkway in five.
Gordon Stewart is charged with having a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The complaint is that Mr. Stewart had his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstrüther, argues the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC introduced the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most valuable option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both have for $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other fans are close.
Place your camera also on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorder have scenarios and recording modes that optimise the lighting time for the adverse underwater conditions.
And before you jump in here, check how deep your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the evaluations to digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple-stage recordings - because many won't be hit.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD that you can compose images with. Action-Cams are not normally available.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the right image setting is a cause of happiness.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a sequence mode that makes a series of recordings with slightly changed lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes more dramatic, as you keep away from the surface.
So if possible you stay close to the surface if you take in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice in the country, but it is so important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed width lens, which means you need to go closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he planned his career to save both the agony of disease and the quality of treatment for the patients.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important for diagnosis and disease while the treatments are mainly involved with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose course of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noted that he had made his wife Juliet impatiently.
"I want everything better than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unreasonably upset.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The results of the R & D investigation were presented.
He looks at Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that causes the chest failure, so he attacks the lungs with excess skin.
As with most cancers, the exact solution is most difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smoking earlier.
But Mesothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbest load - contact with the fascist material, which once became known as "survival" but was known as deadly.
For most of us, Mesothelium is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed to not use it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the substance - klampner, construction workers, room people and workshop workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be quite worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inevitable.
Britain seems to experience today the height of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, as many people die in this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelium cases since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects of death, although asbest has been illegal for years (1999 has been banned from all kinds of asbestos), is that a mesothelium develops only after decades.
And the taste of mesothelium is not limited to former workers in the cotton industry.
It was best, and is often still in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools in which we learn, and the businesses in which we buy.
So Mesotheliom does not know any class problems, financial limitations, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliamentary buildings are polluted.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been removed as a starting guard.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a klepmpner either.
It was hard for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then find it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnel at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos."
All - students, nurses, doctors and pfortner - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my old friends will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been sick at Mesothelium in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last person who is still alive."
How many of us are still sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesothelium was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an extraordinary long life.
Fifty percent of all mesothelium patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesothelium, Professor Julian Peto, notes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestepidemia is expected to occur in Britain, there will be a total of 90,000 diseases.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die like this.

A brief look at the acts of the courts in which the victims often resorted to as a result of the claims of damages shows how far the myth is already spreading.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, gave up Janice Allen on a bicycle-free asbest.
She worked for the chain for nine years from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twins.
"For this matter," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelium, I didn't even know anything about Asbest.
I never thought I'd get involved.
There are only a few people who know a lot about Asbest.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name refers to the word "asbestyform" here, a description of the phase structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbest, is today the most commonly found asbest in buildings.
It has been used for roof discs, floor discs, rotary insulations, drillings, even for brake spaces in cars.
It is less lethal than other asthma, but it is still considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible deaths.
However, the brown asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Crokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was one of the world's largest importers of crude asbestos, and experts argued that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major basis for the unique high mesotheliums."
A staff member of Marks & Spencer was assigned to Alamy at the Oxford Street, London, as best available at the Flagship Store
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliomorph, but Julian Peto's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
He has submitted a study of those concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelium has been caused by work or household exposure, probably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can get out of it to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been exposed to the substance in ignorance.
Goddard reported in 2009 that the service cases and pipelines behind the committees of Parliament were damaged by Ashbest, whose fatal phases could be triggered by something as hormonal as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems as if the opposite is happening.
While the directive of the Parliamentary Labour Service stated that the Westminster Palace had received a "purifying health certificate", it was, among other things, that 1 billion £ of labour costs had to be raised over several years in order to renovate the Parliament to modernise the electronic installations and remove the waste from the Eastminster, and that after the general elections in 2015, the members would probably be more at the next QE2 conference centre than at the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of Asbest was not carried out in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost your life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general nurse.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asthma during his work in hospitals.
"I've been working in a hospital where asbest complaints were made positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all places where you worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day started in December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he just conducted an operation late at night.
Suddenly, I was breast-feeding.
It's all right.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't gonna make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest failure caused by the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelium.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Marvelous doctors take turns taking his breast and place Pleurakathether to take fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remain undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports occupation and intense breathing.
In 2011 a patient was diagnosed with mesothelium with similar symptoms in his practice.
But even now, the offer is not related to his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened, and his own house manager brought his CT scans and rounds to a group of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after the first time the offer was felt sick, a probe with a camera was introduced into the hole between the ripple and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even have so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelium."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelium Diagnosis
Suddenly, he had an abortion with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take an attorney.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which ruins were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets young people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous rats with asbestimulations in hospitals were buried under the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed into other buildings in foot-and-mouth tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), came with greater likelihood in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-threatening but life-threatening for treated doctors.
He's still gone today.
The students put their bunsen burners on asbestmatts.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls because of its fabled and flammable properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had the first sex contact in the classroom.
Over the country, thousands of Chemistry hours, students have dropped their bunsen burners on asbestmatts.
On websites, the theme of Asbest in schools is now often discussed.
And that's why such innocent objects in our houses have always included such things as foot-and-mouths or boots as well as standard asbest.
"It's an industrial gift that is included in most of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the legal lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman was the break-up of a garden shop in the 1970s.
So watch out how you break your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that disease is incurable, are immanent.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't be having another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from a doctor's position to a patient.
He reminds himself of how he was overwhelmed by all the information he had to come with.
"It was very hard to take it all up," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I've been?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience any more Christmas party.
It was then."
Mesothelium is particularly domestic because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelium are caused by asbestos contact.
As best consists of smaller phases.
If the asbest is raised and the phasers are inhaled, they can be found in the brush field, which is the skin around the lungs.
Asbest phasers irradiate the chest failure and can resolve cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the drug-induced asbest phasers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thorax doctor who changed to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed him to the asthma is now ironic, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelium.
Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who probably were also exposed to asthma during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbest glands reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressured by the passage to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is initially invasive.
The usual options for other cancer disorders do not work so well with mesothelium.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is heated.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure loses it.
"You can't cut the fracture," he says.
You don't come here with the mayor.
Because the cancer says "on chemotherapy is not very good," it shows "activation", but it doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gold died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesothelium, he contacted Andrew Lawson, who had been a single-man support and consultancy office for his victims four years after his diagnosis.
"Hallo, Krebs centrale," he gladly introduced himself to call.
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Initially, the offer was offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last for four months and probably extend his life only for a month.
"I was confused," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
However, Lawson created "the things in a slightly more positive light."
Following the consultation of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred further, I just called and got a term," Graham says.
A normal patient should be given a transfer and wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelium cancers in order to ensure the best available treatments.
But if these treatments are finally inevitable, many are concerned by another financial concern - about the future of families they leave behind.
And thus they turn to justice in hope of forgiveness.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here, the company's consistency began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally gave their case to the hospital, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-fledged damage," since Lawson could not prove with absolute security that his mesothelium was returned to an asbestoss contact on Guy's.
After an investigation into his death, however, a speaker of Guy confirmed that "the asbest phasers were removed in the range of sources concerned in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbest
In fact, it is for mesothelium diseases that are trying to cause damage, an enormous problem, the death of an Asbestos contact of a company or a place of work - normally decades after the events.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance details may be lost.
And those who argue against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation which made it easier for mesothelium to claim damage even if their former employers are no longer present.
The Law has established a fund of 350 million £ of the insurance industry supported by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 per cent of what a court could have spoken to them in a normal criminal proceedings - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications are expected each year in the programme.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many mesothelium agents that 350 million £ represent a "very good job" of the insurance sector.
"This is a deal of insurance policy for policyholders," he says, and he points out that in this sum it is about a quarter of what insurance policy would have to pay if the time had not begun and mesothelium banks could find the companies and they could normally complain.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also said that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan gave that, in view of seven deaths a day, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelium Act in December last year.
At this point Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After its first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast with Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-way therapy that can present a survival rate over five years from up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's of course with the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that's gonna keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse.
Graham Abbott undertook the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots on my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
This is life-threatening.
Once again, the offer was subject to six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumor anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very intense.
They need to think about practical things - about money if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the time-set works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
They have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my daughter that I would have a disease I wouldn't be old.
They reacted differently.
Tamsin is very popular and unassuming.
She told it to her friends and we soon received very many calls.
Ellie was back there.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for mesothelioma patients such conversations have not been conducted by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the final case for Stephen Jay Gold) brings a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelium is not life-threatening.

Asbesto paints used for the strengthening of cooktops and for greater heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes Asbest.
It's been developed a tissue that's not burnable.
I've seen servets in the stones as a result of this.
The use of modern commercial asbestos begins in Italy where it is used to produce paper (also money) and material.
Important asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal insulation substance for the steam engines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
Global asbestos production increases by more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Statistics from Prudential identify an early death rate for those who work with Asbest. These do not receive life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that asbest particles in the lungs "without any reasonable doubt are the main causes".
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaws employer, Turner Bros Asbestos, does not take any responsibility.
No damage will be paid.
During the second world war, intensive ships were built, one of the most deadly operations with asbestos contact.
Voluntary export of the industry to imports of blue asbestos
A Court of Appeal confirms the first successful personal injury complaint in Britain because of contacts with Asbest.
Global production of asbestos increases by more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
A health and safety-executive company in Britain is obliged by all companies working with Asbesto to apply for licensing.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are legally prohibited in Britain.
Any use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelium Act is adopted in Britain.
A damage programme of 350 million £ will be announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, white asbest is still used in many countries of the earth as valuable building materials.
Worldwide production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China rejects Hong Kong's right to government elections, demonstrators serious compensation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Kong elections.
This event is likely to threaten the long-declared protests in Hong Kong Business Area, while activists lead the planning and mobilization into the path within a few hours after the transfer.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-performing candidates.
"It doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been contacted.
And it's clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be "chatoic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom has returned control over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people from 2017 to choose the president of the government.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic break because there is a direct right of choice for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding the run by a highly controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
In addition, after a new class, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" should be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Following the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to block the financial area if Beijing does not allow a real general right of choice.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy central prisoners gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they had planted protest bells in the coming weeks.
However, they did not do so in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers shared that "the movement of the central area has taken into account only as a last resort, an action which should only take place if all dialogue options are open and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been created and the occupation of the central area is definitely taking place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing themselves for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures were taken, including police forces and barracides.
The discomforts are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they will gradually lose control of their city.
The attractiveness of people from the Festland enhances competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement as they threatened the business company - the lifesaver Hong Kong -.
"Protestes from whom they speak could cause great economic damage, after how many are involved and how long they live," said Legal Expert Queen Ip, who has criticised the movement for a long time.
We do not want to make sure that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media in China reported recently about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western Powers.
In this summer, activists organized an informal referendum on election rights, involving 770,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demos of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school dropouts in the United States will now be transferred to universities where freshmen events are offered with private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this request and to offer the first luxury travel service to students from Britain today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive event at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also pointed out that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, instead of having to cross their ports in a dangerously overloaded car across the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are happy to ensure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of resistance and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there were no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, he added that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also shared that despite the student fees of $9,000 per year it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago - it is more important to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as being outlawed.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely different from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month with the study see a crisis of living costs, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not take a strong rise in the calculation of the simplest basics of life before they can think at all about spending thousands of dollars for something as simple as the arrival in the student home.
Females criticise racial issues and police behaviour by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants held their hands in the air and sang, "Hands high, don't shoot," while waiting for the end.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the explosion of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators set the gender before the race when it comes to the right to reproduction and income equality.
However, as the tensions in the Middle West increased and the whole country received attention, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100% towards the race.
Compared to the black women's answers soon after the 9th August shootings, the personal essays with titles such as "Ferguson thought of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" are relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant a major change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light, which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered as "female topics" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from all over here," Mitchell said.
If I have something to say about how colours are under pressure in their own country, the weakness is overwhelming.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For black women they didn't have the luxury to separate the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the topics of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors are doing the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were won between 1865 and 1890 and the foundation was almost always the strengthening of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify Lynchmord.
For Hattery, the column between white and black women came at the point where white combatants for women's right of choice, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for women's right to vote could only be successful for each group: women or black.
"They decided to apply for women's right of choice, and the right to vote for black should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, one will be able to understand why colorful women do not trust white women.
We haven't done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after 1920 women received the right to vote, it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original prayer for the help of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists " arrest" played with the problems that black women had been facing for generations.
"It wouldn't be great if activists who have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control the reception?" asked Mitchell.
Women of the second generation, who are building their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was released and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian’s Colonist, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand one of the inherent dangers of the body - and opinions on race which are clearly different in public questions - will be led by the changes," wrote Stone.
Although stone stands for a more inter-ethnic feminism, in the race as well as sex topics, some of its comments on the theme of race in America are confusing.
Christina Summers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colorful men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but stone comments to Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Spanish men, there was a religious reaction of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is forced on the front of the mainstream feminism.
After almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the country's south-west border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that they should only publish the stories of immigrant women for a review of the topic.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of labour visas go to male immigrants, the women accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a clue in women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate painters, as it was shown that it showed a great woman who had made herself comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for $120,000.
The details included an image of the living room of the house - a woman also heard that her head had prayed on a sofa.
Immobilienmacker Connells said that the woman on the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was published fairly and was removed in the middle," said one of the company's speakers.
In the exhibition of the house Connells described the former Assembly Hall as "a unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the Maker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house provided social media for interest, as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City Harvey holds a new millionaire after Lottowin
A lottery player from Harvey is this month dran
The search for a new millionaire in the southwestern part of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper skiing skiing in Harvey took Jackpot for the first time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner must still report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit was concerned about conversation in the small town in the southwestern part of Perth.
The city's talking about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a profit could come in.
Eight WA-winners have celebrated winning in the first division last month, a taxing conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Valley was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before winning the winner of $7.5 million.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the win would allow them to buy a new house and a world trip.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first Division in the WA this year, totalling almost $85 million.
A Leonidas in the Gladiatorian
Not only were the gladiators in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römerday in the leisure park.
However, the excitement of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who despite the rain and the autumn cold and were fascinated by the historical spectacle.
There was a wide range of exhibitions, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was no doubt the martial battle break from the "Amor Mortis" Gladiatorian School, which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust battle art with soft sand.
Gladiator "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and professional presenter and sent his men to the ring for a sharp double match in various gladiatorial events.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with right-hand and short-sight and legs on the left leg and arm-shoe on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chestnuts, shorts and spinal cord, as well as its gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "retiarium", which was attacked by hurricanes, Dreizack and Dolch against the "Sector" and shortly after the battle the Bursche was thrown down.
There the swordsmen were metalically different, created the paintings, and flew suddenly through the arena so that fear and fear could be felt about the health of gladiators.
However, the imputant "Summa Rudis", the muscular judge, had a constant attention.
"We wanted to re-live the Roman daily and make the culture of the Roman era more real," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, president of the event "Freundskreis Romercanal", the intention behind the show.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum" was set out in the free time park for one day, a Roman city, as Vizebürgermeister Klaus Wehage stated in his statement.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest into our region but also the Roman culture and many works that we still admire today.
The rest of it was also to be seen on the Roman day, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Romancanal bridges, which stood at Lufttelberg.
The Frontinus company put the water and energy supply first and now against it, and business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of those days".
This is also confirmed by the "Innovative TeamTwo" of Rheinbach, a diplomat engineer named Ralph Heiliger, who presented the Romans' measuring instruments such as chrobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented ski lifts and models of the excavating anno 1894 as well as brick stones from the original hypokaste, the heat air heating which once heated the Roman villa.
It is also impressive to see the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the tunnels of Ton before they burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland Landesverland had excavated the rest of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
You have found walls of an economic building with a door for drying grass and milk.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morcheiser explained.
A number of background pieces of these extracts were presented in a glass vitrene, including a large teller, several fine glass faucets and parts of a narrow neck chain.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century B.C.E. until the fall of the Germans in the Roman Empire at that time, Morcheiser doubted.
The children also worked with the Roman windmill, similar to today's molluscs, or they write their names with metal grips on plants.
In the state of the Roman term Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay themselves, build themselves on the position of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glasmosaic and serve at the centre of nature Eifel Nettersheim a heavy white powder from stone to paint the flour for a flatenbrot or mousli.
With the originally built Roman passenger cars drawn from two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also went through the impressive state of the city gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rômer-project Weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also be introduced into the 2014 year of Rome, which will be commemorated at the death of Caesar August 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history agreements, as well as the Wachtberger Wander Association, the Partnership Union and the Oberbachem Leather Games are offered, among other thematic trips, a lecture, cooking and school guides and remind you of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary from his work on the present watch is presented as living monuments from the time of Rome and a vital teaching hour is offered in matters of international understanding between a group of "Germans" waiters and brought to Romeers.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Romer theme within a week of the project.
With the Rome Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in the Watchberg are to be re-enacted.
A small presentation will be remembered at the bottom of the Berkumer Matronenheiligum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic imposes the West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are confused - and international companies are moving away.
The prevailing Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The Erte is devastated by the fields that have been left behind and the markets are destroyed - the virus has seriously added to the region.
Some international companies are already on their way.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the most heart attack
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to deinfect Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the worst hit by the virus, the only one here falls more than 600 people to the victim.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease was predicted in every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
As a whole, more than 1,500 people have died, thousands more have joined them.
Foreign companies withdraw employees from
Overseas companies in the resource-rich countries are putting their business out.
Foreign companies such as steel companies Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
Local dealers and farmers also respond: Only a few shoppers leave their homes to care for the afterlife.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the main coffee and coffee beans for export are broken down into the fields.
The farmers didn't drive it to leave their home for the rent.
Food becomes scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his toys, remains home.
The population is therefore experiencing the effects of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the advantage of basic foods such as rice is lacking.
At the same time, the region is heavily dependent on international companies - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies are mainly women over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
In the case of investors, the impression could arise "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugo.
The disease also imposes the extrapolated state resources of the countries
The disease also imposes the extrapolated state resources of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely exploited by high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already agreed to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also painful in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
Although the oily region in southern Niger has not yet been affected.
However, many people are already at home with fear before arrest.
Also bookings in hotels go back to the hotel.
Protection celebrates her 50th anniversary
The conservation association "tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary of its 50th anniversary.
On high-rises the preparations for the 50-year founding party were underway at the Tanenwald Protection Union from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, 12 September, a large entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 18 a.m., the big baller shoots.
Next is the large fortress of the voting evening with the "stupfälzer spitzbow".
Glasses provide for the music
High points on Sunday are the Festival Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large fast for 14 o'clock.
The next afternoon is also the price distribution of the Bundes and Gaussian.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 firm ladies with their fingers.
It's the glass of Bergau.
The government has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March to "social maintenance through room support and small-scale skiing".
The NS regime had ordered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
In April 30, 1964, 19 young men again found themselves in the Gasthaus Lukas, who removed the "new" protection unit "Tannenwald" Bergau from the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the union as a champion through a difficult start time, where it was mainly due to finding a unit location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the protection team began in the guesthouse "Leininger" with two men in the round fight.
In the following years, the sport shields, which were organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The United Nations record was simplified annually and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protections has increased, members' numbers have also improved.
After the joint "Leinger" has no longer met the requirements of a modern protection union, the immediate management under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a 2700-hour workout on May 8, 1988, Pfarre Roadser gave the church victory for the new protection rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the United States was certainly the 44th blast, connected to the celebration of the new stage of protection in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Protection Union celebrated its 30-year-old foundation jubilee.
In 1995, a group of farmers was established.
Josef Schmalzl was referred to as Böller.
A major challenge for the "buller" and for the Union as a whole was the orientation of the Bayern Buller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facilities in the Bergauer Court last year and have brought them to the latest state of technology.
11 teams in round combat
You can also see the sports services of the defence union.
In total, 11 people are currently involved in round-the-clock combat: six air-armed men, one air-gun man, one sport gun KK1, one youth and two AH men.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann is raised around 2013/14 by the Gauoberlagi (the highest League in the protection camp ANB) in the district camp.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schumann and Tobias Graml are raised from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberlagi.
In addition to the ski sport, events such as basketball, fashion and royal ball, pool flight and Christmas celebration tradition.
With this, the shields are also at the festivals in parishes and municipalities.
Tony Stewart makes an accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway.
For the second time, Stewart went against the wall after his right forwarding in round 172 and ended his night.
Stewart drove his injured car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now he's focusing on the race in Richmond, Virginia the next week.
"I wanted us to have a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already been running on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair his car's right side.
"I've entered a good outcome with a right hope today," said Johnston and added, "It just didn't regret it."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trapper and the team had packed it and was ready for departure.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an axle race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his place of work during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr.. This was during a race on the road to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the investigations due to the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was yet made on whether Stewart had to count on a complaint.
The three-year champion was received with great opportunity when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12nd position, Stewart was already in the first 10 sentences and was temporarily placed at four.
After a new start in round 122, busted
Cars with No. 18 out of control after the exit of Curve 2 and collified with Stewart, where both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to place 21.
Dancers Searched for Springs
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Leader Lisa Neitzel (from left) are happy with disputer.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV year of full-time education are also able to create the continuing schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups were very disappointed.
Now it will be enhanced afterlife looking for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of the eight to twelve years, six in the group of the twelve to 15 years," says the 20-year-old.
The more active it would make the whole much more fun, "you could dance any other choreographies," she says.
If you like to dance, you can have dinner between 17 and 18 hours or on Friday between 17 and 18.30 p.m. in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, not connected to the training hours.
"The training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
Then various choreographys are introduced.
JazzDance has the sign that there is no established form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore over classic to sport and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, neither does society get too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies and we've even spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
We don't have Jazztanz like this, which can also be interconnected in one of the other offers of TV Jan.
Children and young people can always be involved in teaching in children's dance/jazztanz, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop training.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who are interested in discofox, Langsamen Walter, Wiener Walter, Rumba, Cha-Cha and Tango have fun, can watch and play together.
Bulgarian prisons are protesting around the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands after the restoration of their old working conditions that had recently been changed.
There are also higher holders on a list of claims to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Christo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting for a month symbolically against the new working hours and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, gave the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the cooperation union between the staff of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has given Luhansk airport
In Ostukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the front.
After serious incidents involving also Russian Panzerbatallones, the Ukrainian army reported today, Monday, the airport of the Rebelenhochburg Luhansk.
The army also shared that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Pedro Poroschenko had previously taken personal consequences from the heavy downsets of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the Supreme Command without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists once again fired a battle aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in wars in the Donezk region, the rebels subsequently shared with Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships Reduced
The rebels also claimed to have first two boats down in the Asowschen Sea of the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
The Ukrainian Border Protection confirmed that two of its ships were landed near the port city of Maripol on Sunday.
When seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.aa.
Two crew members seemed missing.
In other words, Russia was responsible for the case.
The separatists reported that several municipalities in the Donezk area had taken control of them.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the white capital, Minsk, there is today the Ukrainian contact group.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the separatists should also participate in it.
In advance, all actors used their events to publicize their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the crisis in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogg Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was in favour of the NATO-Russia Council's 1997 establishment agreement.
The NATO Head, however, accused Russia of "a broken deal" of the agreement.
"Today we need to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, "to see us as enemies".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
At the NATO summit in Wales to conclude a "Readiness Action Plan" will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kieve and Moscow join in new gas talks
As a result, Russia and Ukraine have merged official data into new discussions on the follow-up of their host conflict.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.
The European Union will be expected to decide whether it will also agree with a representative for the talks.
As a result of the struggle over the gas price, Ukraine has been unable to obtain any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also disrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe is about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, most of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Answer: Maut will come "ganz clear"
Now the Chancellor is aware of this once again.
A letter for all complicated details is not, however.
Heartbreaking concerns from the CDU against the Pkw-mout caused the CSU to melt.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been able to answer for the introduction of a Pkw-mout after persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To say it very clearly: she is in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," said the Partyheichfin on Monday after the meetings of the CDU Spittengrämmies in Berlin.
In a detailed model, however, markings were not first fixed.
In the black-red government program are called "certain parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and is now being reworked".
However, the NRW-CDU needs to be on its no-one wall on all roads.
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) would be constructively involved in the consultations for a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, perhaps even in broadband construction.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "spegel" report uncommented on Sunday to check his house's own concept to pay car investors with cash revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing a maut concept against the federal minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his findings.
"The Coalition Treaty never went out of it to build all circuits and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country president.
If so, it would be an important signal that Seahofer has now announced once again to talk about the subject.
Opposition to the plan also comes from the CDU country-bound Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is fears that a bridge affects the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had asked for a series of CDU coalition streams because of the crater's criticism.
In view of the conflict in the Union, the Left sees the plans as being broken down.
"The Darks-Maut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the maut the Minister is breaking up." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignite duty on all German streets to start 2016.
Inland car owners may be subject to the Coalition Treaty but may not be charged additionally.
They should therefore receive a full balance between the Kfz tax and the Maut.
However, the model does not allow foreign drivers to participate because of their nationality in accordance with EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Briton says she thought she'd die as a result of a failure diagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the faith that she had only a few years to live after having been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, it is located at the Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of highly experienced disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and back.
Charity CMT UK shared that maldiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because it is so little known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, uncertain walk and broken tracks.
Patients also suffer from feelings of depression or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms with time become worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedrey Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she died 18 and before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are now 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as others.
I kept going, and everything stayed with me for a while.
I was never able to ride with the other children Rollschuu or Skateboard and was often taken to school because of my kind.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old after several operations to relieve her achilles and tear her foot from her feet when her doctor had left the room and let her go to FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone about it, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and I would soon lose all my abilities.
I did it all alone with me, and I planned my own recovery.
She said when she was 17, she became clear that she had not taken her abilities as seriously as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and woke me up and said, "Dear, I don't think you've got it, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was established.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awarenness month to focus on this disease.
A. D. Berni Dieter has been working since the end of the former team exercise place as fireworker
For almost ten years, the former team exercise place in Münsingen will no longer be shot.
Nevertheless, every month a deadly munition occurs in the heart of the Squabian albian biospherical area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be thrown in front of the ground.
An inexhaustible knall is held during the explosions over the heart of the biospherical area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot took place at the Münsingen team, which ended after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 acres [6500 ha] large area has been the core piece of the Squabian Alb biospherical area, which is opened on 13 designated routes for passengers and bicycles.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
Rehabilitation of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country in the past year have been slightly increased, while economic recovery has accelerated, so a new study published last week, and companies in Washington Room did not constitute an exception.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia totalled $27.6 billion in state and local positions in 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent compared with the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company's state and local tax burden rose by 4.3 per cent to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent in the year before, and it was the third growth year following several years of notice 2009 and 2010.
State taxes are higher than local duties by 4.3 per cent, so the study carried out by the services agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre was conducted by a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56% are from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland's revenues are from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies by 28 per cent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the company's real estate value, says researchers, resulting in an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the run seems to be to reach the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase over a year of 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values is not as effective in Maryland as the increase in state and local tax revenues, as the real estate tax rates are nearly more than one fifth of the tax rulings of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Centre on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to leave much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The most recent recovery in tax revenue by companies cannot be calculated solely on the recovery of the real estate market
Company inputs also appear to be obtained, so the data are.
Companies in the region reported revenue taxes to state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland received $1 billion in company income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not increase equally in all three places.
The rise rate in the district was 4.3 per cent to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax rate of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has a 6 per cent minimum income tax in all three official areas (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is 9,975 per cent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and that a better tax climate prevails in general than in Maryland.
In the study the district was not studied.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent in the coming year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate by up to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington space and therefore pay more state and local taxes, so the latest study.
Enterprise taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure that is organized by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year, rise by 20 per cent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to be maintained this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be restored if the government's reduction of expenditure was affected by the labour market in the region.
Partner city: Deutsches Bier for Guangzhou
Hope and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
Deutsches Beer enjoys a great reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner City in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct connection between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, born in Frankfurt Partner City Guangzhou - thus expresses the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery had landed in our city," said the vice-president of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the executive of the ruling Communist Party of China came back in the course of the discussion on this location of the 12-million-metropole.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Li said.
So people also have the purchasing power to provide German beer.
The Hessian SPD president Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, vegetables and food," he added during lunch with the party worker in Guangzhou.
This pleasure of life has already left Mr. Li, he smiles at the host.
In this case, the official from Guangzhou came up with a cheese bowl - but with red wine, which was served at the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brown art.
Tsingtao beer will be used after the German cleaning offer.
More Business Transport
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-President Li.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was hit for economic reasons.
"It would pay back again," said the Communist politician.
"The traffic between the two of our cities is still going on."
At the time, travelers had to take over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, is also looking forward to the flight connection.
The Deputy Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, placed this desire in the background when he spoke with the social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied the founder-gumbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German scholar, declined.
Entrepreneurship
Guangzhou's famous vice-president hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office this year only after his predecessor was transferred from the office because of corruption.
The local party chief Van Qinglian had to go too.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in parties and administration carried out by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top officer in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a great work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a thousand city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km away is to those who are provided by both sides, about a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropole on the Perfluss is as strong as all hens with its economic power.
In the next year they wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "presses the dams"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comer will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continuing love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're all pressing the drums.
Her mother was subsequently given sources on Thursday after a heart attack in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them in mind and under close observation until they are satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "ernst".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an extensive online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners from today's market, more stringent environmental standards apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can recognise central data on a glance like the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" category of damages apply to solid nitrogen oxide values.
In addition, there is more money for farmers: they receive a federal minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Exchange for $1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - bought the video streaming service Exchange for $1.04 billion ($990 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a transfer from Twitter, but because it was suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it appeared as if selling Twitter to Google's video service for a cool billions of things, and cooperation seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly becoming a platform for players who wanted to publish their love pieces in games, a YouTube for live games, such as an insider.
The switch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which the best-known (most elderly) play an incentive for memory awareness theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's also that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitter, so the news that YouTube Switch wanted to buy a long time ago took a lesson book example from a established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a suggestion why the deal with YouTube was not possible, since the company was prepared to follow reports, as well as to pay much like Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitter: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they drive more sport than they do, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from looking at others instead of taking control consoles themselves.
It's a matter of looking at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she gets hurt by resident Evil, and something else to look at a spinner about how he gets shot 20 times later in Call of Duty in the head.
All these games can be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today, so without self-control over the perspective, it can be a good recipe for headaches.
I would like to point out that the fast transitions in which the Roger Banisters of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are sustainable.
But as long as there is no game or humorvirus, his exchange channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do you know about the sort of thing I already know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It's hard to imagine that exchange will be integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video how YouTube Switch could have just been able to turn off.
But Twitch has something that each company would like: thousands of young men who are being acquired as advertising.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of the game," and the media does not show signs of collapse, nor even - luck - as spectator sport.
On Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest some were released on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the strong rise on Saturday evening, 1200 musicians arrived at the open-air festival in Burggarten.
At some point, the admission had to be suspended.
"That was embarrassing," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salszedel l Light and fun.
Of two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in Salswedel Burggarten is to reflect light on the day and night through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened up to open air.
The organizers had promised a party for all generations.
And that is their end.
Around the supplies on the bourgeois field, there were saltseeds, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings were comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waving with the foot in the act, enjoying cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and good were said.
And that's for generations.
While the white sand on top of the extra-carried sand slipped on the beachbar, others were resting on a quarter of the wine in the vineyard, the next spring fell on Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the children's makeup, the volunteers had to do their best in the true sense of the word to become the Lord's Andrang and to impress fantastic creatures in the small faces.
The larger used the kickertics or participated in a Skateboard workshop, which was designed by the Goodfoot Crew from Salswedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 7:30 a.m., he invited the visitors down, especially families looking for the width and dryness.
However, the attraction of the party did not break this.
"There have been more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a success on the whole line.
Therefore, a repetition of the great party is not opposed in the coming year.
In spite of the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's vote.
As noble as it was, he mentioned that he had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently the security firm was booked with too little power.
The consequences: Some who had already paid were no longer on the ground.
The resonance was very good.
In a first predictive estimate, the Salswedel co-organizer spoke about about 1200 visitors who were in the bourgeois garden.
There were problems with the technology.
The Salsweide hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore drew their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half-sound sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the cells could not be brought to Salswedel because of a rifle pan.
"But in the next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The prize of the Amula open-air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes which are still being removed for the first time but must be eliminated at the second stage.
The social network of Facebook must also cover the organizers’ criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just waited for more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"You're sorry you've taken a little over there," says Ele Roommann in the same position.
Others do not see the initial problems as serious.
I think it's very good that some people don't just suck, but they're also really trying to put something on their legs.
Shut up!" Stephanie Jenz writes to the Amula.
Now the organizers are going to have a year to stop these critical points.
New room in Berkum: Watchberg's sign is breaking
It is not expected.
More than that, the existing part is expected to be used in the marked construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA World Watch radar, the hall, called the Radom, will be completely restored.
The new radius will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new hole is the cape exchange
The upper quarter of the old hole is removed and taken with a crown.
Then the last quarter of the new hole will be set up.
If the weather is playing, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant in the Ice Bucket-Challenge declines in Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain wrote so much as her iced water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painfully down there.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she had cried so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she had recovered the keefer.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much as her ice water was poured over her head that she damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my liver remained simple," she said against The Mirror.
Ewiser is protected over the 20s.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go away, the cook was confused, and then I realized that something wasn't right.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost got into the shed, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from the United Kingdom were admitted to the hospital in order to reenter the patient after taking part in the virtual trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the bourgeois be seen soon again on a beach?
Finally, there was an ongoing dispute between the two Wolffharhaus bourgeois.
The Presidents are now considering possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfharhauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfharhauser Burgfhausen, led the project in French Guadelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie.
Speakings vary from place to place to place, such as the history of the Wolffharhauser Burg and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: soon there will be talks about a common procedure.
This is confirmed by the United Nations President Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriend) at the request of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and suggested that we should meet once," Sjöberg reports.
Its view is that all members of both associations could go back to a string in the future.
This is how it will be faster to record visible success.
While the bourgeoisie's friends were looking at the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the borough at Bergwald, the "exclusion and survival" of the country stands at the top of Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the bourgeoisie, was very pleased with his own comments on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been standing in front of the city's friends.
A new president is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
At the moment, the unit is about 40 members according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have first allowed the activities of respect to rest." This "denk phase" was necessary in order to "pass on how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president should then go into the discussion with the bourgeoisie.
Until then, the citizens could also make a current vote within their group.
There is no candidate for the president yet, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will be found." He doesn't want to apply for himself because he has his seat in Bad Tulz.
The new president is supposed to be a Wolfhauster.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much to work" on the project.
The different positions in things will be rebuilt in the eyes of Piffls probably remain in the near future.
He considered Dimbath a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the city.
Two similar, far-reaching projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not air-locking.
Through a high participation of the population and by voluntary help from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at first.
But in time, I am more and more convinced that it is reasonable to move the project forward. It can create a "all-inclusive" feature for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU exchanges, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of the reconstruction is therefore not a personal one that I want to throw overboard." He hopes that the bourgeoisie may move something in this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "is important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clevere Road to Save in Uni Teachers
Since the costs for Uni textbooks for many students amount to more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second-mester student Matt Schroeder handed out a smarter sparide.
He found a rental system for books by students of higher semesters and filed a nominal damage to delay the sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a check-file-A cake," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Coveant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He gave out $120.
The college team shared that the students averaged more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and study materials, however, that there were different cost-reduction options for students.
Online sites and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasing the solution of the choice for the students.
The rental of textbooks becomes more popular, and thus students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when shopping.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university books, shared that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Questions in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the College booklets were rented last spring, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are sold after the statement of the Trade Union National Association of College Stores in Campus Books.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Online shopping
Some new books are cost online only one third of the price they have to have in campus libraries.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler cost almost $290, however, can be related to the specialized textbook dealer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If one does not make notes of other or normal use tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold again for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommend students to ask their professors if earlier expenses are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminars are not relevant.
In such cases older expenditure can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs for the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, half of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
The rental of textbooks is worth a transfer if you treat them well, think about giving them back, and you do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a new purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself about the provisions of the business where you hire, as well as the penalties applicable to writing notes, promotions or use trails.
Adjusted renter: If you do not return the book, the tax fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who is first visited by Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, as it can be so safe to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check whether the book is actually ready.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in college libraries.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Not a Casserator
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million in his 90 million budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" played only $12 million in his 70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape" that was filmed on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on opening week, while children's films such as "Sex tape made easy 2" were also impressed by the inputs.
An article by Telegraph Film critic Robbie Collin indicates that children's quality films may be the reason for their lack of quality in films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Drinking easily made 2" as pure "functional" fantasy.
In films for an older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the film is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average cinemaScore and metacritical rating for each summer movie start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year at least 2000 links.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematourists and film critics and indicate that this year's films are similar to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing sights and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix is to be returned.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Dysney's recent film of Dschungelbook, said to Hollywood Reporter: "I believe the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current low cash outputs of Hollywood production, Netflix has recently achieved transactions with current content of $1.2 billion, almost doubles as much as in the previous year, where sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on films by Comics and predicting a "nuclear meltdown" Hollywood.
In the light of the current withdrawal, some commentators argue that its mysterious prophecy may contain a real core.
Due to the expected potential cashiers in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultran, Miniions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of cash result as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer in the kitchen, and no one will worry about the business."
A few years ago, when the second class of the Tabesteni district was attacked for the punishment of the lien assembly, it was a step in the right direction.
The German Board of Boards has now taken an additional 3rd German flag into the programme.
The result: those who do not rise will be raised.
This is how Göttingen's highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberlagi Religion has avoided the decline, however, in the next season only five classes.
Torpedos Damen, despite their great throughmarks in the regional league, remains four-class.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Wende.
The SG Langlerns and the Torpedo Reserves are part of the new League League, and there are no more Göttinger Clubs in the Landeslaga.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandslaga, the Torpedo-Zweite in the Landesliga.
What the composition looks like as a better district class is now the new southern district soberlage.
This includes TSV Selingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district camp, they play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district superhero of the women begins at least in solar power.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wölmarhausen run in the district camp.
With every nine men
The SC Wende sends his girls into the small district camp.
The SCW boys' neighborhood staff - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two Göttingers circle with their nine missions.
In the West Staphlet are Red White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the East Staffel play among others Sattenhausen/Wölmarhausen, Nikolausberg and Landofhausen.
The Damen-Kreislagi consists of sattenhausen/Wölmarhausen II, Bilshausen, Heavens, Selingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women teams at cross-levels.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd class of cross-sections will achieve the strength of the cross-section, the innovative and dynamic circle president will have to think about it once.
Nato-Gipfel: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by Nato-Gipfel's enemies in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport as an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff before the city hall to stop a so-called confrontation.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Younger jumped out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bus drivers were taken safely with the sail wind after they had spent the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man soon arrived at Govett's Leap in Blackheath on Sunday.
Concerned relatives called the police about 20 hours after the two of them had not returned home.
A search call from local police and rescue services emerged and the couple was found about 23 hours away from the Bridal Veil Water Case.
The girl had hurt herself on the knee and the man was hurt and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple's house, and they were out on Monday morning.
They were placed in a stable condition with a hospital car in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Scale Government-Owned Protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After about half an hour, the transmitter re-commenced the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with parts had damaged devices in the editing process.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators will demand the return of the Head of Government, which they refuse to vote.
The police shared that about a mile away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, it was again Monday to meet some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospitalization, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed on the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to prevent Sharif's residence.
They request the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday afternoon after a meeting in the Army headquarters, "to disappear without time and to use force".
The report further stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The scaling violence has caused concern for an invasion of the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests launched by the opposition policy of Iran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif's leaving a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday.
"We won't go back without having to force Sharif back," Khan said.
Qari seemed similar.
Khan suggests Sharif to have won Parliament's election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri demands the return of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are used to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had at first peacefully challenged Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them on the weekend to move them to Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after the second season on site three of the tables.
With the 2:0 over Graidig, a biter week for speed has taken a humiliating end on Sunday.
"The victory is very friendly," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intertwine with the outside of the European League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschütz Steffen Hofmann, who held three seats with green white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings speed to victory streets Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki with the second season and goes with a success experience in the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said external defenseist Thomas Schrammel, who with his great driving Volleyy from the sixteenth century in 14 minutes has won the weekend.
"I thought I had the whole fruit from Thursday and hurried it under the bed," said the 26-year-old.
It was still for Ried, as the last time he met in a federal party on November 13, 2010.
Therefore, the first master of fast dress will remain in special memory.
"It's something very special for me, I'm from the rapid wake," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beck-blassur, he turned from the left to the right side of defense and made his case very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in mirror traffic.
He's earned it, he's already had some assistants," praised Barisic.
Mansion shows character scarmel also delivered the flake at 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally led to the decision.
Because that's why they could have invited the guests.
"Thanks to God we have had some luck today," said Schrammel, who also said on the side of performance and results last week: "The results have not been voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisc even found that you were "in many games before now" – against "the strongest manpower that played in this season at this stage".
The first three points since July 26, therefore, have proved that the men's suit has been intact in spite of: "Today my men have shown that they have character."
It's no less fun for him: "that we've finally played zero again."
Many work during the country's game break also the situation that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavel, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are to blame for several accidents, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debut, making the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," said Barisic, who lost his partner and Pavel player in the last three days, "those were very stable in the last three days".
The country's game break must therefore be used to "fuck up the waves and add a little bit to the body area", Barisc, who has five U21 out-of-offices in his ranks.
One who is likely to have a special break is Captain Hofmann.
He's crying for the crew, he's going through pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in 68. Not only the structure but also reached the second tower.
For the 33-year-old, who graduated his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admiral).
Hofmann: "Don't think it's all right now" "We've probably also had some luck, but sometimes the happiness has to come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," Hofmann said.
He was free to work on concentrated work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we can't even believe it's all right now.
He couldn't argue the importance of his role for the team.
But it's a very young man who I can really help at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to offer himself and his men.
He regretted the quick encounter "out of the Zaubertor category", as well as the regular door of use in the 40th minute, which was recognized by Judge Collegiate.
The only thing I can do for the crew is that we were not really enough towards Tor in some stages.
We've had too few conclusions.
In defense Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a tower.
There would have been more in size and size.
Under this Wipf, peace reigns
A powerful tribe we showed during our summer series "My piece from the Rhöner happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the countryside, the model illustrated is the "smooth" above the wet spring.
A narrow footway leads up to about 600 years of age.
It's going through groups, basalt stone and basalt stone.
A piece below the stone bridge from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it goes beyond the other trees of the environment and remembers with an area of more than eight meters to an American motherfucking tree.
A small Buddha on a treetop indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intense research, however, there was only reference to the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishop's Archive and asked older people from undersea brunt to learn what relationship it has with the geese.
The result of his research remained the right new explanation for the names.
Therefore, until about 80 years ago, the dragonflies should have moved their animals from undersea bungalow to the ground on which they were bound and released from stones.
At the foot of the tree the animal shelters created from the rise should have been excavated.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance because it does not really go back to the trails.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has continued to find out.
In the case of stone collections, however, caution should be exercised, since the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for Kreuzottern.
A walkway leads from undersea springs to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further ways are described to raise the direction of the High Tower and invite you to an extended journey.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a watersburg, which is sought in our next assignment, is rarely found in the height.
The mirroring in the grave already has a good impression of the construction work, but in the countryside we have some historical buildings that could fit into the building's interface.
Where is our "part of the Rhöner happiness"?

After a week's graduation, Italy's Prime Minister and former EU President, Matteo Renzi, launched the appointment of his Foreign Minister Federico Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week, followed by British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi takes into account how the Government's daily newspaper La Repubblica reiterates its call for Mogherini, also in the government team as a favourite, to strengthen the position of social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an operation for his "Reform Package" in Italy.
In the end, Renzi does not hope that the remaining left-wing party base will still rest against him, because Mogherini will be awarded this – even more in a proper way.
With regard to the conservative representatives with the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish Donald Tusk appointed as President-in-Office of the Council, the presidential opinion in Rome is to create a political balance.
Because the EU's Chief Diplomat will be co-rapporteur of Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament's continued approval is certainly safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano had called the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) perhaps almost an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica disseminates optimism that the "great challenges" of Mogherini, who has been active in leading parties for almost two decades, will show themselves growing for their honour.
The married Roman is married and has two daughters.
Your party careers began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth.
With the 2001 election in the Left-Democrats Party, she joined the high party policy, working in the foreign policy department, whose leader soon became her leader.
Its traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was made known through studies on NATO integration in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, and made contact with the social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Board of Directors, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international matters.
When Renzi became a Premier in February 2014, he took Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship to the strong movement in the country which contributes to the more than 40 per cent vote of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in the PD crises, Federico Mogherini has a share of it.
The conditions in Brussels, which have so little diplomatic experience with new EU external officials, are therefore missing in substance, are reflected in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, mistrustful realistic accents Mogherinis is being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and is described as "a foreign-friendly course".
It sponsors the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is to be transported directly to South Europe by the Russian company, as well as by the Italian energy security.
After Renzi had served as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shakespeare's hands were taken with emulation in Brussels, and they invited the Kremlin chief for October to an economic summit.
In total, nine young people started their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has completed another training in the company before.
In four training courses, the new staff are active in the future: electronics (three training), mechatrons (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the country circle Schwandorf: Tobias Brown and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Reuters from Schmidt, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in the form of forest, Felix Domaier from Overvechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zühner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Tenz.
The new trainers visited primary secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainers and trainers travel to an Oberambergau team of seven, including a full-day migration and routing on the inside of the program.
The company is 435 in Germany and 950 in the world.
The number of trainees is distributed throughout the year 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said the main allies of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deep-rooted links to show "their love" for the disputed socialist presidents whose cabinet training has been put to failure by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As an overwhelming gesture, the Prime Minister stated that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strict demands after a closure of the regulation of pages by Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his mitosizists to "show themselves" to the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, is struggling to get involved in the movement in which she attends a meeting of disgruntled socialist MEPs and the Socialist Party criticized her for taking the French "believe in her future".
Marine Le Pen, who was the leader of the National Front far-right, lamented the ongoing civilisation struggles of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Vals government would continue for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would proceed with the proposed elections as a winner and be ready for the government.
France's ruling party is making a fall in the municipal elections in March and the national legal front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe that the socialist party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch period 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and the number of job losses.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise short before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cross-border supplier, is leading, according to the knowledge of the industry, advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its well-being, while it is competitive with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CRL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources were therefore able to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo gave a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, which is located in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, acts under the names of Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cross-road industry is totalling about $29 billion and in the coming years it will be expected to grow as a result of the strengthening of the middle class in countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position for these new customers as the best choice for cross-road service providers.
Prestige Cruises asked the US regulatory authorities to proceed in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a free-time and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
In January 2013, Norwegian Cruise went to the Bürse.
Genting held at the end of June 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise are jointly available according to the original application documents for the arrival of Prestige Cruises over 82 per cent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists judge China the day after the election.
A group of pecking-insults pushed the Chinese flag near.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is intended to be composed of members of the group.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and forced pro-democratic activists to prove their threat and to slow down the Hong Kong financial platform with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the leadership of China fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China was represented by the government of Hong Kong in June, Democrats held an informal referendum on the election procedure in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a seat there.
Lis Question is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong Affairs and Macaus of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced to gather on the afternoon before the Hong Kong leadership office.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not have any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiew to take up "Statehood Talks" with the Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked for Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has set up a fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and is taking immediate negotiations on "Stateship" of the region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the region of Austria, under the control of the separatists, would be part of Russia, but that its status would have to be redefined against Ukraine in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kiev Government to negotiate at face-to-face with the pro-Russian opposition, however, fits into the strategy that appeared to have been followed since the beginning of the enlargements five months ago: Help for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to make the newly declared Novorossia region actually independent of an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April, after Moscow had announced the Ukrainian peninsula of Crime on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the unique area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds us of the revolutionary brightness of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those involved in campaigning Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and during government groups attacked civil communities in the areas held by separatists hope to be "caught in their illusions", reported Itar Tass.
"We need to engage in extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of South-East Ukraine, in order to ensure the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said Putin's reference to statelessness must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can share the necessary autonomy in the eastern areas, Peskow said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker on the correction of Putin's "failing performance" comments underlines Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast to the direct annexation of the crime on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow had far greater difficulties to anchor the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and raised questions from the time before the conflict for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy spoken by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments of Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations and thus give Kreml de facto control over an area connected with the Russian state.
The semi-trailer named five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian sea as well as an important trade and historical coastal region.
In addition, the regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crimea are rich in mines, factories and geothermals, which make important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Pedro Poroshenko suggested that Ukraine's legislation - following new elections - should take into account additional constitutional provisions with which more control of its finances and the status of languages should be given to the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arms are called upon and raised by Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists at high altitudes followed a further advance of the rebellions last week, after Russian troops and Panzers were entering the former peaceful region along the Astowsche Sea into the Eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took action in the hands of the Ukrainian security officer, who said that the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crime, is the control of Novoassk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are being launched to establish Maripulol, a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoassk and the small access to the semi-trailer Crime.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, an former Soviet republic which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreigners are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions which led to the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should take effect at an unprecedented scale of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to return from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian Panzer columns and 1,000 soldiers spent the last week in the Donezkregion to support the trapped separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers likely included in the Russian attack in Ilowajsk were replaced on Sunday against 10 Russian chancellor who had been taken into Ukrainian territory a week ago, shared Lysenko on Sunday.
Head fotoscanal for Australian Promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a cure for his pastors about Hacker, who probably stole pictures of his promised Gabi Grecko and a who is the one who stole the A promise from Hollywood.
The film town is excited after a series of clear photos of a famous Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking canal about Promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible may have more than 60 photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tribe of Panama" and Superstars, including Kate Upton and Cara Delevigne models, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actor Kirsten Dunst.
According to Australian players Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were also reported to have been taken by the public because of an iCloud luck.
The list is 101 Promis.
First one who had spent the last month with Grecko said to Confidential, "It's not true."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Greeko, in New York time, reported on a news site that the hack was "slow" and that the affected "slowly" felt.
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, two of which she is located on top of a pool.
The Palmers film works include "Love is invisible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the player Browning from Sugar Punch weren't available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' said against TMZ: "It is a sudden destruction of the private sphere."
Player Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "The stolen images from a phone are nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
The continued spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and wanderers were at 8th on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the "Help for Cancer Children" association.
The tour, which was for the one torturer, was a light training for the others.
In one, however, they were all alike: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Upper Brauhause was driven by the train to Feldberg last night.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle catheter can easily be removed so that on 8th row, he has also brought him valuable knowledge to the Grand Feldberg in favour of the "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) association.
It's a great thing.
"Now I know I can do it - great!"
Small money on the way to the app board?
No, if I kept it once, it would've been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper City Parliament, many of the 718 participants arrived in the morning at mountains and came close to the creation, but happily on the platform.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good 11 kilometers long distances between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The full-time Green Politicians from the Crestag - red dress, red bike - did something on the ground floor at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there is the goal!"), then turned out to be half-profic at the mountain and went for 45 minutes without any breath.
He has also gone through the street in a Rutsch, as well as Nina Kuhn, the city's press spokesman Oberrusel, who had made himself together with Frank Greeneisen on the way.
For the two Triathletts, the "Feldberg Radeln" was not necessarily a sport challenge: "Here's about Charity, we're happy with it - we'd have made a trip today," said Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The young (12) was forced down to the upper end of the morning to climb again at the same height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zérz had moved at 9:00 a.m. to the sattel, "made the fieldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the overcrowded Kultkiosk, bicycle trips over the Feldberg are easy to do.
With his 6.5-kilo racer, he's been on the track for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like it," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambited racer".
This must be him too, because he was on the "Fixie Council" road, which are also racers, but without a lock...
The fact that it went up without wheels also proves not only the 20 passengers who climb up the white wall and the foothold to the ceiling but also a Jogger who pulled an autograph with weights on a cord.
Professor Volker Lischke, who, with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad for safety, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special trap trawl, only to keep the trap itself."The man is therefore certain to be his own trap dog.
The 718 participants - and as many as never before - were sent to groups on the street in the morning.
The traveler first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first driver and driver at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later the first mountain biker released.
Bent Hansen, president of the Association "Radeln on the Great Feldberg", gave the start command and wished the participants a beautiful trip.
For the next year, he hoped that it would be possible to block the route to Feldberg beyond the safety of the participants.
