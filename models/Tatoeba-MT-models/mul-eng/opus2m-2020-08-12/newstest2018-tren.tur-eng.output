Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are perhaps more than a billion species of birds in the sun's solar system that can cause serious consequences.
The path of these objects that are closed or open to the creation of the sun can sometimes pass through the world.
The 2014 JO25 asteroid at 650 meters is going to pass from a distance of 1.75 million km to the world's nearest location at 14:24 p.m.
In the past day, we've become more frequent about this kind of news.
The most important reason for this is the development of surveillance techniques and surveillance devices.
So we also have the possibility of identifying asteroids of a smaller size that have not been previously identified.
In October, for example, an asteroid was just half the world and the moon's distance (~250,000 km) in its size.
And more interesting asteroids could only be identified a few days ago.
So there may be other cosmos that come up against us right now.
What would you do if you found out that you had a 20-foot-inch asteroid?
Actually, this size of asteroids won't destroy your area, but it'll probably blow up all buildings.
This will also be due to the shock waves spread from asteroids that interfere with the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013 the asteroid landed in Russia was in these sizes and was able to break the windows of several cities.
But if you're on a 100-foot asteroid target, you'd go at least 50 km from your recommended area.
These are factors that indicate the depth of the crater and the damage it causes.
Let's look at a few scenarios, according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid in 100 m is opened at 45 degrees per second, it becomes a crater about 250 metres deep and about 1200 meters wide.
The drilling Richter is equal to 6 degrees in intensity and even if you're over 10 km to the point of impact, it's going to be 3 degrees in your body.
The last 50 miles will be waiting for the broken window cameras.
If an asteroid hits in a mile, it's gonna take something else.
It's open and fast enough to form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 km away.
I mean, he's gonna turn into a big crater and then he's gone.
Even if you're 100 km away from the point of impact, the resulting heat is 3 degrees in your body.
According to Richter's estimate, breastfeeding is equal to eight times the rate of depression.
The damage that asteroid will cause depends not only on the chemical composition of asteroid but also on the shape of the area that will hit it.
The above values are presented in the scenario that emerges from the central scenario when asteroid like a solid rock falls into an area that is caused by torrential rocks.
If the asteroid is formed mostly of iron, then if it falls into a surface that is formed with a layer of lead, the crater size will rise 3 times and the risk associated with it will also be shared.
Before this, 66 million people were killed in an accident that caused an asteroid crash about 10 km away.
Because of the asteroid crash and the destruction of 75 percent of black animals.
If this level of a great asteroid that destroys dinosaurs, it's gonna be safe to leave the most healthy choice planet.
There are tens of thousands of tons of material every day from space to earth.
Most of this is blowing up in the atmosphere.
Some of the stars that grow enough are due to what is known as the explosion of stars among peoples in the atmosphere.
Let's end our letter with another message that will comfort us.
The experiments show that there's no way that a giant asteroid is expected to hit the Earth to the extent that it's going to happen to very severe damage over the 300-400 years ahead.
I'm sure the average has comforted you as a living person for 70 years.
Flash idia for medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is clearly looking forward to the departure of the name of the Black-Whites who wanted to celebrate the stopper region, is looking forward to the departure of the name of Inter in the day.
The 30-year-old footballer who takes the lead in the Confederation Cup is waiting for his 30-year-old to start working with Inter in the past.
The Italian prestigious newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, a stopper and a former liberator, pointed out that the Department offered Inter 10 million euros for Medel, which could be held in the area of freedom.
When the Black-Whites who offered Medel the offer indicated that they were waiting for the answer on both sides, it was said that the Chilei footballer was looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Kara Kara Cartal, whose FFP limit against the idea of Gazetta, is very difficult to pay for money like 10 million euros for Medel.
The Black-Whites are likely to lead to Medel by the way of renting as they are in the transfer of the Caner Erkin, or go to a serious download at their bonservice.

A travel notice for the human rights group Missouri
The National Colorful People's Progress has published a warning for people who travel to Missouri because of the State's different policies and terrorist attacks.
The Group's report says: "The Mission State of Missouri will pay special attention to the presence of African-American tourists, visitors and Missouri in recent times, due to the fact that some of these incidents are occurring in the state's press, as it has indicated, when they travel to the end of the country from the beginning of the country."
NAACP; a new Missouri law said that it made it difficult for people to obtain separate cases, at the same time that the State's legal application was aimed at adopting shortcomings without interference, and that the group was involved in publishing this travel notice.
"The rights of man are only those of mankind who have been given the right to do so.
They're stopped by the color of their bodies, they're beaten and killed."
"We hear complaints where we haven't heard before."
The last time a U.S. state has issued such a warning.
The group showed examples of terrorist attacks against black students at Missouri University and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was taken under the supervision of the Missouri police after the state's fire was over and died under suspicious conditions.
In addition to its advice, Missouri is paying attention to a new report that shows that it is possible to stop more than 75 percent of the world's white drivers.
Chapel said, "His advice is to keep people awake and to warn their families, friends and working friends that they might be in Missouri."
"The people must bring security money together and tell their neighbors that they're going to get out of this country, they must be ready."
According to the latest number of hate crimes reported by the FBI in Missouri in 2015, 100 hate crimes have been committed; this is according to the country's number of similar cases.
The travel notice refers to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult for a worker to take responsibility for his work, renting a contract or doing work.
Previously, for the US Civil Liberties Unit (ACLU) Texas and Arizona, these countries have published a travel recommendation after they have passed the immigration laws of the local executive agencies; ACLU says it will increase their application according to the chain.
Travel warnings are usually published by the Foreign Office for other countries, but in recent times protection groups are being used in response to laws and trainers in the United States.
departure in part is complete
Two months ago, the Chinese team of 13 million euros in front of Shanghai Shenhua returns to Demba Ba, which has been hired by the Black-Whites in the course of the past season.
Kara Cartal, who asked for a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, moved on after the report from the Star football team.
The Chinese representative, who started working for a 32-year-old black-white player who didn't think about the season frame in front of us, stole the door of the Shanghai team.
Couldn't write to list
Dempa Ba, who is not listed as a foreign state in China, has advised me to manage that he wants to return to the Whites.
The Chinese team approved the divorce of a 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to sign an official agreement when he comes to Turkey in our days.
Castillo was operated on Trabzonsport
When the Bordo-Mavil Club was posted on the website, Castillo's left-wing left-wing arthroscopic menu operation at the Istanbul Liv Hospital was suggested, "Prof. Dr. Winning Rights is expected to begin with a team within 4 weeks".
Castillo, a team of Bordo-mavillas, was driven from the right-hand back yard in the Dutch field of Slovakia by the team Heerenveen.
It was decided that the Colombian player, who would stay away from 3-4 weeks for treatment, was to be treated for the problem of the previous menu.
I'm referring to Barzan!
As a result of the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Ezids in the heart of DEACH by the terrorist organization, Barzani made a speech during the memorial ceremony in Duhok.
In his speech, Barzani, rather than referring to the independence that IKBY wanted to set up on 25 September, said: "I must regret this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and fair country."
We tried all our ways with Iraq, but we were completely exhausted and disappointed.
The past experiences we have had with Iraq have brought us into this state, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
That's why we need to show that all of us are able to identify our entire world framework by my reference to life and security.
And I need to draw the bottom of this; I mean, it's not a goal for us, it's a tool to achieve a bigger goal.
After the 2003 date of the fall of the Baas Rejimi, the central government of Iraq, recalling that it was in many promises to Kurts, said that it had been decided directly after the conflict with the DEACH.
Barzani, who wants to identify his people in a uniform and democratic way for their own protection and development, said, "It has come out with the bells that Iraq can't protect us like a state or not."
"He doesn't want us to move on." He said.
During the fight against DEACH, the terrorist organization recorded Barzani, who had recently been law-enforced by the central government of Iraq in a short period of time, saying that he had not been armed by the central government of Iraq:
In Iraq's defence system, it wasn't reported in the Westmerge.
The central government didn't do what he told Shabi to do to the Westmerge.
It's accepted as part of Iraq's defence system, according to her mother.
However, when Hashidi Shabi's mother did not exist, all the possibilities were repeated by breaking the laws.
We're not saying we're against Shabi now.
The West Sea and the Hashdi Shabi, which fought at the same time, and why when the Hashdi Shabi are legislated, the existence of the West Sea and the fight against terror is over.
These are our most serious injuries.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization DEACH launched an attack on the Ezidi people living in Sincar Valley, killing many of the women and children among them.
He's been back from the front for 10 minutes.
According to a BBC report, the Boeing 777 type passenger plane to Air France was part of Hokkaido in northern Japan when North Korea was on its way to the airport.
The authorities recorded that the plane landed 10 minutes ago, and that the plane was expected to be close to 100-150 kilometers.
In an explanation made by Air France, it was recorded that the plane did not break up with the flight route and that the word did not have a problem in flight.
In the explanation, "The information we have on this stage shows that the plane has dropped to sea in more than 100 kilometers."
Nothing sacred?
Trump's White Saray is now the target of Freedom Heykeli.
The most specific sign of the change in the regime is the beginning of an attack on images.
The Americans know that it's as close as anyone; as a result, Saddam Hüseyin, who was personally involved in his conversion to the Firdos Area in Baghdad in 2003, was...
Stephen Miller, one of the key organizers of the Trump regime, was aware of what Jim Acosta and another from CNN were doing in a dramatic debate about the illegal immigration restrictions, and he was sure what he was doing when he destroyed the House of Freedom in a symbolic form.
If it was to be fair, Miller didn't attack the building himself.
If he did, he'd be tied by the owner of a full boat and the freeman.
But he attacked his mansion, and especially after 17 years of his appearance in 1903, Emma Lazarus was brought back to the mansion that he had been given.
When Miller went out to Acosta, he said: "I don't want to talk about history here from the beginning, but the Highness of Freedom... is a symbol of the world's embodiment of American freedom.
What you're talking about has been added later, and it's not part of the original Freedom House."
Miller's really right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This seems to be about the burning of Lazarus's insulting words, not only of some elderly migrants but also of the same kind as those who call on the poor, poor,/outcast whales to take the breath of freedom, / The desire of the blind.
There's never been such a time when we didn't want to show up on our screens.
Miller didn't bring an action; he explained that people didn't like Trump in the U.S.
It's part of a wider political and cultural struggle about the meaning of an institution: it's actually a conflict with the meaning of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends in the campaign knew very well that they had taken a political action to put his words on the foundation of the temple.
Heykel, France and the United States were about to celebrate the relationship between the United States and the United States, representing the advancement of freedom in the form of women.
And Lazarus had changed his mind: and she was healed from sleep. And, behold, a voice came out of the city, saying,
And he calls himself a very different name: Mother of the Empresss.
With the view of the city, her marriage is an attack by a foreign feminist and a devastating attack on the American movement.
And just as Lazarus changed the temple floor for a long time, the doctors wanted to change it again.
As a result of Trump's arrival, Baptist John, a leading spokesman for the regime, Rush Limbaugh, said that he did not invite anyone into freedom in 2010, but that more American fires were an early novel that kept the world in darkness: "Mother's freedom is on the rise.
He's got the freedom to move from the United States to the rest of the world.
I don't want you to explain the way to the United States."
In a way that didn't work out, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The temple's meaning was concerned with the full opening.
Lazarus ’ wonderful works of creation, which he saw as if he had been seen by people who had fallen off the shores of the ships, but who had lost hope, were far away and far away from them.
This was actually about seeing the world from the perspective of people who wanted to improve their lives.
His illustration of the widow and the judge highlights the need for us to be patient with them.
Of course, it's not a prospect that Miller and Trump find right in any way.
Not to show them the way, but to lead them astray from the only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black is members of the British team
Eileh Doyle remembers when only two Iskochs could join the Great Britain team.
The United Kingdom Acting Director of Athletics, Neil Black, says 16 people in the World Championships will provide the Iskoch Group with "a constant battle."
The record number is selected for the Scotch lottery, which starts on Friday, London 2017.
Black believes that "something's going on" in Scotland and that the United Kingdom should learn from it.
Black said, "We're mine and we're trying to understand it, and we're gonna get out of the job."
"I'm talking to people at the Ice Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Isociatism thinks it's about what she did.
British athletics: He thinks it's about what they're doing.
That's the guy in the street.
Whatever the combination of conditions, that's definitely great."
Laura Muir and 5000 m will compete against Sir Mo Farah, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete for many Scottish athletes, and Elidh Doyle was elected captain of the board.
"It's a little low-fashioned.
Captain's conversation was unbelievable," says Black.
"No matter where they live or train, several athletes have become very proud and really motivated out of that room.
He held Elid in a natural state, and he really felt great."
His fifth World Championship, which will compete at 400 metres from the National Assembly, says the 16th Scotch is "unbelievably" to be in the British team.
The best number of athletes in the previous world championships in Scotland was the number of matches won in 1983 and 2015.
Five years ago, Brittany and two Europeans were in the middle of a runaway race, the leader Muir.
It's going to be 1500 m and 5,000 m.
Chris O'Hare, another Scotch to be monitored in 1500, was a very good season, including the British team's experiments and the Summer Games.
Doyle, he remembers the first season of Lee McConnell's only ice cream in the team.
The team captain says that many of the mayors will not just join the team, but in some cases they will fight for the medal and give the finals a "very proud" move.
"The special idea of being the captain of my team is that the team has been with the votes given by other members, so it's already a great honor, but knowing that your team friends voted for you and that it's your choice of you, it's also very special for me."
"Of course, I'm proud of all the Scots in my team.
This shows how far we've been through.
And they're here as self-contained athletes, as well as as those who help me get out of my podium.
When does the captain speak?
Yeah, I think it's okay.
I've benefited from the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, since there's a World Championship in our home.
I mean, we can't really get back to the Olympic Stadium without this fact.
I'm taking a second chance of going out there and fighting, and there'll be such a wonderful atmosphere."
Prevent activists on Facebook: Don't participate in public tasks if you can't remove the behaviour of the voters
Our country's father had a lot of information about where to take place.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the paper began to make it more serious about politics than anything else.
Of course he's upset with those who do.
But those who did it did not stop.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed from the middle, and we can drive it stupidly and without voice."
This brings me to Mr. Larry Hogan, who needs more work to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff prevented and deleted at least 450 people from sharing their views on his official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Unit charged him with this week.
Valin's staff didn't care about the fact that the case was serious, and the translators were full of "Who cares."
Many people said, "This is just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're someone like Hogan.
It's a popular community fair in a democratic state.
It's the second highest bidder in the country between 50 states.
Hogan isn't a crazy joke.
He showed his authority over his family and the principle of principle.
It was also very desirable to use Facebook as the first tool to connect to their voters by providing their hairless head with a funny way.
In other words, it is necessary and most dangerous to prevent people from being on the page of a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by members of the public for tax purposes.
In a report with The Washington Post, Hogan's wife, Amelia Chase, defended the Department's performances by claiming that the ban was not too much for them to handle.
But it's very easy to use images of bullies or spammen or hate-filled people.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were banned by Hogan.
And these are the true men who spoke only to the chosen leaders: a teacher, a worker, and a pope; not a trolley.
He said that all of them were not respectable, reasonable, and ungrateful.
In his participation, Father made a petition from the Gospel, calling Hogan's Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not full of hatred but asked questions about hate crimes.
He wrote to the section of The Post's report, "I have done my best in a Nazi way to his hate crimes and other news reports that I have been disappointed that I've been left out of the picture."
"I also don't like the idea that when many people make an effort to do the same thing, I just don't like the idea of seeing myself as a collective effort by a large group of concerned people."
Others will probably refer to Valin's staff as the "accompanied spam attack".
Facebook makes it easier for a message to be delivered easily by blocking or deleting a message we are not using.
The staff is much cleaner than the old days when they are sent out to collect and burn newspapers or arrest protesters.
But even if it's digital, that's exactly what happens.
Hogan, Facebook and other social media are not the first public duty to disable.
President Trump is being tried by Twitter users who are banned on Twitter.
One of the decisions that might be referred to in the future came from Virginia last week.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris of Alexandria, the President of the Board of Governors of the Loudoun Governing Council objected to the change in the First Anayasa on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Vali Matt Bevin was visited by ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, there was a very similar effect on the internet of the cheap mail store.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was broken up into four, and the anonymous letter writers showed his leadership.
Even then there were unknown trolls in Washington.
"Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to all journalists that took Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to George Washington, a translator who collects historical documents, he has signed a petition office concerning the United Kingdom's Friendship, Ticaret and Siarysefer Agreement.
But he did not stop them.
The term, being a guest and free of charge, takes place on the basis of your country.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty, looks forward to the rest of her house at Renaissance Club.
An old European number, Ronan Rafferty, looks forward to the three days before us, the Renaissance Club in South London, the Scottish Senior Open's 25th edition.
In Archerfield Links, Paul Eales has a new relationship with Northern Ireland, leading the next door before he loses Paul Eales, and he acts as the founder of the club and as the messenger of the tournament named Jerry Sarvadi to CEO.
Rafferty said, "I've been watching the construction of the Renaissance Club and we see you've moved on with this organization."
The players will see the scene in a state of black.
Jerry set up this place and got a job in the bathroom.
He's a champion of this game, and he's proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this area."
The British Eagles and the European Tour will provide a first-time campaign in the 32-year career, despite winning the European Challenge Tour.
Southport central player said, "This really feels special."
"I didn't have a chance to protect Open in Extremadura because it was taken out of my calendar last year.
It's nice to go back to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are alive, and it's been very special for my wife Sharon and me to win last year.
It was a very special time, and we will always remember it with love."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour at the beginning of this year, is returning to his own field.
This organisation will be the first to be awarded to the Scotsman since Aberdeen Asset Management Open in 2013.
Helenesburgman Orr said, "When you fight inside, it always means a little more."
"You want to do good, but you feel too much pressure.
I was really surprised to play again, and I played the basic golf.
I'm so happy to be going this far."
This was attended by the three; Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrence is located between the 6th floor of Scotland; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
I've got a free ticket and a car; I've got a 5-pound and two or more-pound car.

I've found the answer
Think of it as a "cool" that... it's more than a 10-year-old economy, energy and natural resources, science and technology, environmental and urbanization, health, culture and tourism, and more than any other ten-year-old who took part in the economics, housing, energy and natural resources, science and technology!
Staff number 117 000 378.
Turkey's biggest propaganda campaign!
Yeah, I'm talking about the D.A.'s president!
Yeah, I'm gonna talk about not seeing the Chief of Defense!
It's days... I'm looking for an answer to my question...
I'm really curious why you're taken from a guest seat.
I read every article about sending.
Not at all.
I can't find a kind of solution to the problem I'm looking for.
In the beginning of this year...
Unfortunately, the DIB has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the DIB.
The co-chair was pulled down by Erdoğan under one million litres of S 600 models in Mercedes.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "Is it not enough for seven years?"
First DIB President Mr. Rifat Börekczy has been in charge for 17 years.
All of you know about Mehmet Nuri No. 11 years has been sitting in that chair.
I mean... the other's mission is open.
I'm going back to the question: Why did you sit there without seeing?
I got the job.
Draw Close to God
And the one who was near at hand said, “The Most Gracious has not gone forth from every place of worship.”
The code for this component is: It does not exist.
The guy who took this piece from behind said, "You've found a modernist by the genetic wave!"
I mean, the guest was seeing a young man who didn't see it.
What does it mean to be young?
The problem's direction was hidden on a street outside of Mehmet's sight.
Date: 27 April 2015.
He went to Iran to attend the 29th Conference of the Covenant, which aims to bring about the reconciliation of Islam.
The religious leader of Iran met with Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
And he kept up prayer with his people.
And the conference said: "The poets are the people who represent different ideas and canatas in the understanding of Islam, and they are the ones who have been created in time."
The purpose of all things is to make known to God the true religion.
Everyone is on a road leading to his mother, but they will have the same destination.
It will never be accepted to compare the belief or belief in fate with the belief in Islam.
It's a break-up, decommissioning and a collision, and a collapse of the universe.
He has been the most harmful religion in the history of the Middle Ages...
I want to draw the bottom here again:
Shiller and Sunni are one nation...
No soul shall deny another, because it has not lived up to its understanding.
A year later...
Only Caferi leader from Turkey participated in the 30th VA meeting.
I mean...
It's not an accident. It's an accident.
His visit to Iran and his speech at the conference led him to the goal of the "general use" of paradise.
The next Tahran conference represented the Turkish State - again - that's why no one participated.
He's never been invited four times since he came to his assignment.
The reason was known; the Shii -- Iran's "geneological use!" in the DIB.
Following Iran's trip, the meeting of the Mehmemme, which began in 2016, began to be interrupted.
First of all, the DIB was responsible for the rescue of Vice-President Manan!
I don't see it so much, he wanted to "connect to DIB's Majesty."
It's your job...
There was a difference in the state's view of Christmas.
Theorical worlds, as created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt's metropolis, were celebrating Christmas with Vehabi-Selefik in the U.S. shadow!
These were Iran's opponents who were not even able to travel to Tahran.
It's not surprising that the words about the "Michael Ahmet" didn't mean "Dianate didn't come at risk from this."
My Lord! Make for me a blessed journey to the valley of Tuwa and the holy mountain.
"Alleviation" was used as a symbol of Iran's hostility.
At one time, FETÖ's CIA-supported opposition to Iran was running new names.
Top FETÖ with compasses...
A photo of a young man found in the hand of Viski was used by the media for the lie "The Son of the Blessed Don't See"!
Oh, no accident!
Who has made the biggest public speaker in the media to see no welcome: Turkey, the newspaper of the U.S. Journal of Lighters at the U.S.
As a result...
- He's not going back to the Suudi Vehhabi-Selefi line.
- It doesn't cover the difference...
- Modernist... a religious man was destroyed by a "generical wave" created during the Cold War...
The U.S. cultural imperialism continues to bring Turkey to a speedy approach (to do Vehhabi-Selefi).
Don't worry about the President's future D.C. will be a vehhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the protection of Turkey's genius"
The Foreign Minister went to China on his official visit.
President Vang Yi organized a joint press meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister and his counterpart in Pekin State Konukev.
Vang, "We hope that Turkey will be more actively involved in international affairs."
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its security and security.
"We hope that Turkey will be resolved with the international community that includes the Palestinians," he said.
He said, "The international body is not an alternative but an complement to Turkey, regional and international organizations."
The spiritual picture begins in the second stage
The leadership of Hasan Ruhani, who won the election in May in Iran, was approved by Ayetullah Ali Hamaney, the country's leader.
Hasan Sahani, the second president elected in Iran, swore by the country's religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney when the country's religious leader also joined him.
Turkey's Tahran Magnificent of Turkey, Rizya Hakan Tekin, participated in a tour of the top-level military and political names of foreign representatives.
The Holy Spirit, who will take over for more than four years, will begin its official role on Friday, August 5th.
On the contrary, Turkey is expected to be joined by the Economic Council representing Nihat Zeybekchi.
Security steps in the directory border door
Help, medicine, and cleaning materials will not be permitted from the People's Limits of Haiti in the Reyhanian Valley.
According to the information received, the border between Turkey and the border of Babylon Airport and the area we are unaware of was closed to the outside corridors of human assistance, shelter, medicine and sanitation.
It's allowed to come out of the gate of the border.
There was no information on how long it would take to limit the word.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina doesn't use eggs while she's eating Degei.
He's even using an angry door.
The house lady, in Papua New Guinea's quiet area, in her home in Enorotali, Spain, usually places a sweet patio known as "nota" on fire.
Half an hour later, he's taken a call and he's silhouetted, or he's not tired.
Degei is sitting on the ground where he works as an antler, and he doesn't have any cell phone.
He's got an urgent job at home in the summer.
He was not assigned any responsibility when he was younger than four of his husband's wives.
The diversity is happening here.
Of course, working hours may be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one goes to the village after 5 o'clock."
Just a brief view of daily life in the rural areas of Papua, an old Dutch colony occupied by Indonesia in 1969, which was then forced to vote by 1026 years of age only before the mergers took place.
In the Netherlands, the government of Jakarta, which is responsible for the rapid control of the region by an existing movement campaign against the government of independence, has been directed to the Government of Jakarta, which is law-enforced by foreign journalists or law enforcement bodies.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua so that Papua New Guinea could occupy the eastern part of the island.
It's not as hot as it's going to be; it's a five-hour drive from Japan to Nabire by a 90-minute flight and by a rental vehicle.
I don't have to move the crowd.
In fact, 19,000 people have houses that have been transformed into bamboo chains, and they have been converted into brown brown tones.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and no stranger has ever travelled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, he found the Mee Pago Popes, a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
He says, "We didn't wear these clothes."
"We used to wear only shoes."
The poorest part of Papua, Indonesia, is the poorest part of the population living under the poverty line of 28% and the worst childhood death in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's gold mine.
Phoenix, the world's largest and blackest gold field, which is owned by Freeport McMoran, has a mountain area in New Jersey, located only 60 miles from Panaii, which has 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport returned $3.1 billion worth of gold and silver.
In addition, Papua is expected to have $78 billion in cash.
What is more, these riches, which are a source of security for the Papalians, make it possible for Indonesia's powerful army to carry out a devastating task.
A survey by the New York Times in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid some 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 for one sub-unit.
The populace's more autonomous call threatens this gold-fashioning bird and is deprived of its rights.
According to their lawyers, over 500,000 people have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969 and more than a thousand have been tortured, tortured, and imprisoned.
In the mountains of Papua, the population of the 1970s reached their peaks according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
The Indonesian police only arrested more than 3300 uniforms last year in the area.
The 2016 report of the Principality of Brisbane, "We're going to lose everything" contains evidence of abuse by lawless persons, pain (in particular by another report, tattoos and electric figures) and acts of violence against peaceful people.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims every week because they're happening," says Indonesian researcher Andreas Harrisono of the Human Rights Council.
Papua's resources have been increased because Indonesia's resources have been increased because it has brought its inhabitants from other parts.
The population of 3.5 million Christians in the region is 83% but most of Indonesia's islands are transformed by Muslims from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to economic goals.
He sells gado-gado served with a hot tub and a hot tub.
The local people are forced to recover.
"The hunters sell their eggs and eggs more slowly than local Papuans in traditional markets," explains Abeth You, 24-year-old Panai, who was transferred to Japan's regional president.
"That's why the local Papuans and the Papuan Mamas lost their market."
Jokowi, also known as Jokowi, promised that he would resolve the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua in the 2014 election campaign.
As the old akachos, on his way to the capital city of Jakarta, Panaia took 27 games from 29 parts of Papua.
But there's little change in Papua and the local people feel deceived today.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokowi with the expectation that our hope for the restoration of justice will be realized." You say.
In fact, Panai lived only two months after Jokowi started his career in the summer months.
On May 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside Enorotali were hit by two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle by singing Christmas songs in front of a fire in front of Enorotali.
Fearful kids told them they had to open their doors.
One of the soldiers entered their ranks and returned with four soldiers later according to local pope Yavedt Tebai.
He said that the soldiers who had taken the alcohol from the victims and the witnesses were beating the gang and fighting with their bullets.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kid in the band.
Julianus Yeimo, a 16 - year - old boy, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the government's election committee was set on fire, and the next day the events unfolded.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children were gathered to demand justice at a football field in front of the local police station and military command.
They carried out regular air raids and danced in the Waita dance of the May Pago cable of Papua (maybe running and flying).
Some protesters started throwing stones into the police and military barracks.
When the Xiners were still coming, they were ordered by inside radio to soldiers: "If the crowd shows more than three times as much money, shoot them and kill them."
Jeremiahas Kayame (56), the head of Kego Koto's area in Enorotali, saw the approaching danger and demanded a bribe to return to the rest.
He didn't mean to listen to anyone.
"I was shot from my left arm when I turned back on my back," he told the Times.
He doesn't know who's still shooting, but he says the bullet is coming from a bunch of soldiers.
He adds, "It's a disaster, it's been shot many times."
A local Alfius You were shot three times, according to a local cousin who was a witness to the attack.
John, who was known only by his unique name as many like Indonesians, told the team, "I ran away from him, and I checked his body to make sure he wasn't."
"I saw him die... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told the delegates that their members were only "taken into custody," because he said that he was under attack.
In 2015, Sübe Manager Pudjo Sulistio said, "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us."
"This is the issue of death."
According to the Human Rights Monitoring Council, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi spoke three weeks later in Jaapura about sharing the pain of the victims' families and promising to solve the historical conflicts in Papua.
He said, "I want this wave to be solved right away so you can't go any further."
In October 2016, Security Council Wiranto said he established a non-profit mechanism for historical human rights issues.
But the excuses were almost over.
"Most of the drugs were long ago.
Some in the '90s and some in the early '2000s.
It's because we're determined to resolve these issues, but there's times we have to go through."
Viranto, who spoke to the TIME at the time, said that there was no plan to build a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be solved by law."
B.M., said that during East Timor's 1999 bloodless play, more than 1,000 people, including Panaii, had already resolved the tragic death of 11 people in Papua.
The families of the girl victims faced such a grave suspicion.
"I was invited to meet four times in the past three years, but there was no progress."
"I'm tired."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army. I'm afraid of being shot."
Brother Yacobus repeats his testimony that people in Paniai are afraid of arguing about the situation.
He says after he helped four of the victims into the grave, he was hit by a soldier.
He says, "After they buried their noses, the soldier came to call me."
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Saturday, Paniai's neighbor, Deiai, shot the Indonesian police at the village.
A construction company refused to help a person who was not in its possession to be taken to a hospital, and 17 children were injured during an accident between the owner of a construction company.
When he caught a fish, he died when he went to a 24-year-old Ravenianus Doww hospital.
Local residents filed a protest in front of the company's insurance office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at members, and they showed their attitude by shooting a warning.
But the local people say that the local paramilitary police opened fire on the majority and killed someone.
Domingu Badi, a 29-year-old Witness who is living near the hospital and experiencing injuries, says to the TIME: "We were very panicked, scared of being caught."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Dejai Parliament called on members involved in this work to be held accountable and to be expelled from the territory of the active police station.
Panai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
A significant lack of progress is the disfavor of the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal cables living in the green mountain centre of Papua.
The majority of the populace's rights were joined by the rebel army who claimed to protect the innocent and the Indonesian soldiers from being attacked by assaults on the rights of the populace.
Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya come from some top-level OPM leaders from Panai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and taken hostage by soldiers in the last few years under the cover of the "majority protection."
Some are never seen again.
Panai is known among the Papua people as a "traitic and forgotten place."
Poverty is fueled by discontent.
It's very expensive to buy the low-sales in Enorotali.
We can't get it.
People here produce everything they eat: mainly some fruits and vegetables along the line of the note.
It's the work of women who can carry four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the money for the family, sell it back in the local market.
It's only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the opening of new air routes for the local Papuans and Nabire, economic inequalities have increased between more and more new immigrants.
Few things are going to people who are better educated and richer.
The popes are very proud of their capitals or their responsibilities in order to carry out their own work as receivers.
"Young people don't care to stay in the village because there's no work or money here."
Tecrit, the world's eyes keep away from Papua.
In addition, international media information restrictions are often imposed.
In the beginning of this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were excluded from the "coordination rate" of Papua.
According to Phelim Kine, Assistant Director for Human Rights Monitoring, Jokowi's campaign to improve the transparency of the electoral campaign was not carried out and development promises were not fulfilled.
In one statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to inform the state of Indonesia's silent eastern states of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and blacklisting."
The absence of control of the press means that most of the international pressure on the Indonesian government is limited by the fact that Papua is very close to its neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) commissioned B.M. Human Rights Council, to investigate "various and widespread incidents" in Papua.
The same countries support OPM as historically.
Speaking to journalists in Jakarta, the Indonesian Foreign Office, Armanatha Nasir, said, "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there is a free media, so it's difficult to pass on the evidence of human rights."
The local people want the foreign government to be more interested.
An official delegation from the Netherlands, when visiting Japan on 4 May, when the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited him, broke his silence with a local people who did not want his name to be explained.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papals say they don't have much to vote for Jokowi anymore.
Governor Gobai of the Cable Council says, "A man with the good intentions of Jokowi is in a situation that has been transformed by people who are involved in Panai's attack."
Jokowi wants to know that apart from living under the threat of forced soldiers, the people of Panai wants to know that they are trapped in poverty-stricken injuries with intensive education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like the others of the Papuans, view their own games as a "borch" that they have given to Jokowi to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice."
Despite threats and threats, Panai's victims' families took action against one last symbol: don't bury a victim's descendants in the middle of the police and the army.
They will ensure that at least those responsible will never forget their sins, knowing that the court can never be executed.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yakobus, primarily in a verbal way.
"What else can we do?"
The second time that Dubai's "Messale" went to heaven...
In Dubai, on Friday, a new world collapsed and hundreds of villages were forced to flee 79 castles in the length of 337 meters.
This is the second great wave of the tall building that has been called the Shrine Tower in two years.
The building has been emptied, no damage has been reported, and no explanation has been made for the great news.
"We slept and woke up in the morning, and the people cried aloud.
We ran down the stairs and reached the 50th floor for 10 minutes." He spoke to a quiet Reuters named George.
Dubai told civil defence authorities that it ended up at 4 a.m. in the morning at 4 p.m. and that it was in the process of freezing the building.
The government explained that they were working to make sure that the affected were safe.
This event can bring back questions about the safety of equipment used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The investigation by the Board of Directors after the fall in 2015 found that most of the damage was in external panels used for decoration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that 80 people who died in London believed that the isolation and seizure panel system on the Greenfell Castle, which could be located in the middle of the month present, could be found near the speedy spread of the new moon.
"Social assistance" for more than 4 patients in chronic illness
The social assistance programme to be launched for families and families in a state where chronic illness is not addressed by the Family and Social Policy will be used, at the first level, by 4 000 300 tuberculosis and SSPE.
With its assistance program, the Department will also provide regular psychosocial support, which is intended to provide monthly support to patients on three occasions.
According to the above-mentioned information, family and Social Policy Foundation Fatma Betül Seyan Kaya has identified the details and application bases of "The New Social Assistance Programme for Combating Chronic Diseases and the Inevitable Families", which began working in advance under the direction of Fatma Betül Seyan Kaya.
The social assistance programme, which has been launched with the Health Watch for combating chronic diseases, is the first to be first in many ways in the world.
The Foundation will provide the family with the social assistance program, which will complete all the preparations necessary for the start of the program, not only for families but also for families with regular psychosocial support.
So it's intended not only to be left in the comfort of families and families with poor families who are chronically ill and who continue their treatment processes in their homes.
According to the work done, in the first phase, a mental illness and a brain disorder that is causing an angry microphone will be supported by regular psychosocial and nudity in the acquisition of a new social assistance programme for disabled people who are struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE).
In the years leading up to the programme, there will be no other side of the programme and there will be no support for needy people who are struggling with dangerous diseases.
Support to be given at one place on three or two of Asgari's payments can also be paid to patients with tuberculosis who have not been treated regularly, who have lived in bed dependently, or who have had to improve their living conditions at home.
In order to benefit from the support, the monthly coming from a person is expected to be less than two thirds of the net monthly payment.
In addition, patients with SSPE should be provided with a health-based report based on the methods and principles set out in the Health Report on the Oversize, Classification and Self-Sustainment.
According to the survey, more than 1 U.S. passenger brings legal goods to planes
According to a survey carried out by air traffic controllers, more than 20 percent of U.S. air traffic controllers have lost legal items to planes, including at least 6 percent of those carrying illegal stones or other cut objects without knowing it.
Less than 1 percent of the time later, he claimed that he had mistakenly been traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Stratos Jet Charterers found that more than 1,000 people were under investigation by the Jet Charters, as well as more than 1,000 young road users were more inclined to break the rules.
One hundred of the participants who admitted that they were trying to fly with something illegal by the TSA are from the Y angle, so they're from less than 15 X angles.
The most common ingredients that have been removed from the TSA agents will be eaten and dried.
While more than 3 percent of women's participants acknowledged that they had security-related devices, they also admitted that they had 2.2 percent of their partners and 3.7 of their male partners had legal drug users who could fly.
The firm said how many people have been misappropriated from the security of the airport and have investigated the country's streets to find out how many people have taken refuge.
It's not surprising that people are the most vulnerable to escape from security without knowing or not.
Still, as the company pointed out, the rules of TSA are part of a cross-sectional and head association.
People aren't sure how often they can carry their eggs or how many of them they can carry.
So it's not surprising that the largest mass material delivered by TSA is released as legal flows.
For a while, people thought that TSA could handle books as escape goods.
The wolves are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Chinese U.S. statements have been contradicted
At a press conference organized by Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi, President Pekin, Tillesson called on Pyongyang's administration "We are not in touch with the excuse to send our troops back to the north of the 18th parallel," he said.
China Foreign Minister Vang, Tillesson's management of Washington, D.C., reiterated its priorities on the North Korean issue and hoped that the US would apply these priorities in an effective way and in an effective policy.
Vang, who was concerned about the security of the Korean side, pointed out that it has long been urgent for the Pakin administration to increase its nuclear power, protect its peace and security, dialogue and dialogue.
EPA President Pruitt refused to postpone the Obama Revolutionary Exhibit Laws
One day after being charged by 15 states, President Scott Pruitt of the Environment Security has decided to postpone the application of the laws of the Obama era, which had already fallen into bad weather.
Pruitt represented a change in his own body and the needs of the state-regulators more sensitive than past administrations.
In a federal high court, he never referred to the right to vote against his previous position.
The country's ground level is about to start meeting on 1 October 2015 with the 2015 standards for ozone.
Pruitt told his team that he would spend more time on his own initiative to work on the plan and that he would spend a year in order to avoid "sustaining from making bad decisions or preventing economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, head of state of Oklahoma, served as a trusted defender against longer-term environmental arrangements.
Pruitt has been moving several times since he came to Washington to prevent or delay changes in chemical and fossil fuel industries.
This is the last legal update for the day when Pruitt's re-adjustment is changed on Wednesday.
In the past month, a federal high court in Washington, U.S.A., has ruled that the EPA administrator has exceeded its own authority's limits in order to control and reduce oil and gas spills which are governed by an Obama administration.
In an open statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt made progress in reversing ozone standards, strengthening the need for EPA to meet new standards at the time of the EPA alone and to work through complex procedures.
In his previous work, Pruitt, who accused EPA more than once, said: "The EPA has been unable to deal with the recent history of the most frequent decisions under the previous administrations, and has been firmly committed by activists and others to settle the time-consistencies of the waiting and decision-making process."
"We don't believe in handling the case, and we're taking the time-limits seriously.
We shall take to ourselves the law and the power that he has given us."
The EPA's explanation also indicated that Pruitt could once again use "all other powers that exist as a legal basis" to ensure that the reforms are "supported by sound policies and best information".
Community citizens in the Congress are making a press for a wider rewriting of ozone laws.
A Meclis design approved last month is working to delay the application of the 2015 legislation for at least eight years.
He wasn't first brought to the Senate to play.
Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA's coalition of governments this week, said that he was going to take over the group's legal press.
Schneiderman said: "The change in EPA's decision after our cases is an important victory for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the crisis in New York and its population."
Davada took part in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Colombia.
Cars, electric sensors, oil refineries, chemical bases and other sources of sunlight are being channeled to the earth's surface.
A bad mood, a fast-moving group of people can lead to serious breathing problems, and each year thousands of people die early.
People's health defenders and environments have been moved by Pruitt's amazing change in decision making.
From the Biodiversity Centre, Lori Ann Burd said: "It's so disturbing that we need so much pressure to get this healthy name from the person responsible for protecting the atmosphere."
"We must continue to fight against the ideologies of the storm management, those who enter and out of the environment."
Inflation is available
In December, the largest increase of 6 years in Iraq was dropped by 10.5 in the 13th century, and the rate of economic security dropped by 3.5 years in Turkey.
According to data from Turkey's Statistical Institute (TYK) yesterday, this was the first time that the annual inflation came to an end by 9.79 percent when the TYFE was rising by 0.15 percent in our witness.
With the largest cost groups in our team, the highest rate in the month was 1.75 per cent in the camp and hotel groups, and the largest group showed up to 3.51 per cent in the group.
The highest annual increase in traffic by 15.24 per cent took place in the group.
In our time, inflation, in parallel with expectations, is a single turning point for the economics of Muammer Kümurcü son of the Labourer Economicist Muammer Kümurcüo, "The public view of inflation has an impact on the price of gambling and clothing groups."
However, there is a rise in heart rate at least in the previous month.
He said, "We don't expect the Central Bank to be in a situation of tension."
Manshit was high in the heart rate against the fall in inflation.
From the recent special capture of TÜFE by the Central Bank, B has risen from 9.07 to 9.46, from 9.20 to 9.60.
As capital FX Research Assistant Enver Erkan points out that inflation can be shut down by 9.3 a century-old level, "the inflation can go down by the middle of the month and fall by the middle of the month."
"The hand of the Central Bank can take advantage of the first months of 2018."
Vice-President Mehmet Schimschek: The year of inflation will end with a single dream.
The central bank's inflation will continue to rise to below 7 percent.
We're going to take the form of reforms in the recent Güda Committee.
Economics Secretary Nihat Zeybeck: It makes us happy that inflation is one of the only numbers in the world, but it needs to become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, there must be an increase in prices towards lowering prices.
Lütfi Elvan: In the months ahead, some of the effects can be seen in the annual inflation training, but it will be shown in the inflation in the first months of 2018.
We're assuming that the annual inflation will go down.
I want to make a success of Fenerbache's games after this.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda, UEFA European League 3, said that it is not enough for the second half-performance of the game to be played with Fenerbachce in front of the UEFA European League 3.
Foda, who spoke at the post-commissioned press conference, said that Fenerbahce was a top-level team, "We couldn't use the canals in the first half."
We put the water in the second half of the game.
We've got a chance for the second arm.
I'm still proud of my team.
In the second half, they changed the air of the game.
We could be a little better.
Little things in the game have been decided.
"I want success in the game after this," he said.
Foda said that they felt very good while they were in Turkey and that they were happy because of their lack of faith.

Dillon said, "After meeting the leaders last week, Shuuk brought back his heavy weapon and his equipment to them, but some small arms and light weapons were allowed to remain with them."
He explained that last week the United States had come out of the areas of non-compliance with Russia and had withdrawn his support from Shuuk, including the need for non-combatant activities.
It is indicated that the Group wants to fight against the regime of Parter Esed.
According to the urgent phone call notes, Trump had a print on the border wall payment in Mexico.
The notes of phone calls between the leaders of Mexico and Australia, Donald Trump, U.S. President, were deleted by Washington Post.
On 27 October, Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, on a phone call with Trup, insisted on not publicly telling the public that he would not pay for the border wall offered.
The U.S. mayor hit the head of Mexico, who had publicly attacked the wall, and he said, "You can't tell you that."
Trump started his presidential campaign on building a wall across the U.S. border and promised to pay for the project to Mexico.
The notes of the first meeting with Mr. Malcolm Turnbull, Australia, which was held in the middle of a remarkable dialogue were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the acquisition of U.S. agents to travel to Australia was "massary", "intruders" and "optalca" and that after offering to the U.S. for a settlement law, the agreement under the Obama administration would show itself as "bugala".
Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, ended up saying, "This wasn't the best thing I've ever done."
The patient's neighbors broke the doctor's mouth.
Doctors and staff of the High School and Research Hospital in Turkey have left a short work this morning with a view to being followed by a doctor's neighbors.
He showed the attitude of the patient before the hospital's mother's entry into the hospital with the words "No Violence in Health" that they had carried in their hands.
The hospital's Children's Cardiology Clinical Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Aischeneur Pac, "There is no violence in health" is like a lack of even-right slogan."
There's no place for violence in health.
He said, "If this is the way this people will soon find no health team to serve themselves."
The action of health workers was also supported by Ankara National Health Manager Dr. Kamu Hospitals, Ankara First Region Secretary General Dr. Pöner Hospital, Turkish High Commissioner for Education and Research, Professor Dr. Mustafa Pach and the hospital staff.
Pace, who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who said,
Unfortunately, those who work hard in health are becoming more aggressive.
We find an example of this happening again in the night (the first day) when our heart was broken by a surgeon's surgeon, a patient's neighbor.
In order to end these events just a moment ago, we demand that our government, our ability and our will be able to take action, even though our people's awareness of this is increasing.
I'm sick of yesterday's events and my health workers.
And he who noticed the need for public awareness about violence in health, said, "I'm sorry we've been through this time, and it's been a bit complicated."
He said, "We will take our own steps, but the most important thing is that our people have their own health."
And when Turkmen indicated that the legal procedure on the case had begun, he said, "Our laws on violence in health have emerged in a way that is quite effective."
The state's steps are working on it.
He's doing security work right now.
It's always been empty in the past, but now it's really a public case and the government's law enforcement officer is following up on the case.
He used the words "there are serious examples of punishment in this regard."
Those who worked after the explanations continued their work.
According to Idea, the day before, it was 17.45.
He attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who worked in the Khalp and Damar Cerrahi section, where he reported his death.
While being removed from the scene by the doctor and the assistants, the police were called into the hospital.
When Uzbek broke this, the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses of the case, a doctor said:
When our friend went to the patient’s neighbors to tell him about the condition of a patient who had lost his life, he took responsibility for our friend and attacked our two friends.
Our friend broke his neck. He was in the blood.
Then we took our friend into the operating room and hid him.
We've been on the security line for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient's neighbors had crossed that safety wall, things would have been worse.
It's hard work for DEACH in Gaziantep: 102 floors...
According to the information provided, during a survey conducted by the President of the Gaziantep Community, Gaziantep Emniyt took over a total of 5 000 kilograms of ammonia nitrous nitrous oxide from 102 vessels used in the operation of a designated storage facility belonging to the DEAS in the DESA.
In a six-person operation, the suspect's crew, jobs, warehouses and superiors also had 10 long-standing conventional weapons for these weapons: 35 conventional warships, 2 000 370 guns, 3 conventional rifles, 7 conventional warships and 382 conventional rifles, 2 conventional rifles and 1 ordinary decks, 39 000 705 TL and 15 000 870) USD, 163 thousand TL hostages were fired at 40 000 500 TLs, 2 empty shells and many digital equipment.
There were also 4 official books published by the public bodies of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization and decided to collect.
The six people who were taken into custody were loved to name names after their questions.
The suspects were arrested under the so-called Violation Sulh Caza.
YPG rain in Syria...
ABD is charged
According to AA's knowledge of local sources, the U.S. terrorists, with the support of the U.S. military, did not expand their homes in the northern corner of Rakka, where terrorist forces had to fight with DEAS.
The attitude of a civilized and battered house turned into a terrorist entity.
In addition, U.S. forces in the region have been identified with rotary vehicles.
The "Cougar MRAP" types were found to form a buffer area in the symbol of the Husky-type measurement tools.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow the civilians who fled death in Rakka, who were taken under fire during the DEACH operation, to enter the camps under his control.
A local activist network called "Rakka is shut down without a voice" reported that 121 civilians were killed in a bombfire only in the month of July.
Let's not move the wars of the old world tomorrow
The gradual takeover of the facts of the world and the fact that the countries are not just people but crisis.
One of the reasons why the rest of the Sun is slowing down the world's realities in the form of "darkness" may be that these realities are prevented by certain chambers or by realism.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have also been involved in the world of literature that is slowing down and changing.
Cervantes' "Don Kishoot" is still a match that he thought he was still in a show when he started building his castle.
Or Gonçalov's "Oblomov" is an inheritance that you think would last as long as you didn't see the facts.
The example of China, for example, has been closed to the end of the 15th century when a country that is open to the world and is heading for the oceans, where an imperishable bridge has been closed to the end.
It's just that it's stopped until the captains of the ships that come out of China's black waters.
One foot, one eye and one ear in the West, the other foot, the eye and the ear in the East, we have always had doubts about the realities and change from the Osman.
We tried to move to the old and new part of us today, to understand today with our old-fashioned caravans, and to think tomorrow.
We were able to act as quickly as we could in developed countries, both in the world and in the real world.
This situation has always been a source of tension and frustration.
At Medrese's university, the modern war with youth, the encounters with faith, a dramatic internal dilemma.
And it was not accepted from the people of the right hand, nor from the people of the left hand, that they should return (to the right hand), nor that they should return.
And after a while, the world's progressives began to link "Hain" to what's new and what's going on.
The most important lesson in Osmanli was that those who later embraced the truth of the world and the idea and the government were eventually exposed to impotence, disillusionment, and destruction.
The most important lesson that our heavenly past has brought to the Community was the fact that the rapid pace of the world and change is an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Because this training is very good, we could be an example of this choreography that has been able to protect unity, unity and unity from World War I to this day.
In order to survive the global change process that has been introduced into a different neighborhood, we also need to put our arms back on and act in harmony with the facts.
In other words, no one will benefit from the pointless campaigns and bloodshed that have led to the collapse of democracy in the past.
The most minor mistakes in today's world are to open up to major and dramatic crises.
And the most problem is that we're in the middle of it.
History presence operation on mouse
In an explanation of the validity, it was stated that a historic operation was carried out by the ICJ team.
"As a result of the work done, with 2 suspects, two gold rings, one ordinary silver rings, 20 ordinary bronze rings, 1 gold rings, 2 gold rings, 1 ordinary bronze rings, 1 ordinary stone objects, 8 ancient stone objects, 1 traditional pemba-white stone objects, 1 ordinary image frames, 23 different prints and stones objects and in different colors, 4 ordinary solid metal objects, 6 old paper sheets and sheets, and some of the Arabic pages which were classified as Kerim's original and some of the originals are printed on paper paper and paperboards, 1 paperboard and paperboards are printed on paper and paperboard.
It was said, "Our people will continue their operations in the face of crime and crime for safety and security."
Turkish fluoride
The world states that are confident that Turkey's coming has fought the finals in the wind-circuit power station today.
The Energy and Natural Resources Agency's external dependence on energy has been reduced while the world's economy is being recognizable.
I'll invest $1 billion in the case of Turkey's energy assets, and I'll be able to get closer to four.
By 2019 local production will be incorporated into the system.
Eight Consortiums of the United States, China, Germany and Denmark participated in the wind-central licensing initiative of renewable sources (YEKA) launched by the Energy and Natural Resources Agency.
In the case of the first five tenderers, the tenders were opened for the purpose of identifying the lowest bidder.
The lowest bid was $4.19 per kilowatt.
The open indentation interval is 0.01 cents.
After the conspiracy began, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvioon and Vestas decided to participate in the open exorbitant intervention groups that took place within the Enercon, the Gold Wind, the GE, the Semion and the Westas.
Siemens, Nordex, and Mingya competed in the open auction.
After the withdrawal of the Nordex Consortium, MingYang-Ilk Construction and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon remained the last two.
MingYang-Irk Building took 11 times.
Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Energy Consortium has never been used.
Energy and Natural Resources Mrs. Berat Taking: Day of record for Turkey.
There's been 30 cases of open exaggeration.
It is likely that there was a tension between the two Consortiums, and it was the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group that offered the lowest bid with a cent/ kilowattsate.
When the Consortium offered $3.49 cents/kilvatsavatsaty, the Assistant Minister of the Interior, Alparslan Bayraktar, asked the Commission to make an offer to 3.48.
As a result of two hours in the U.S.A., Turkey received a world study.
The offer of kilowattsate at the beginning of the week was $3.48 per cent of the world's lowest number in this area.
A previous record was in the hands of Mexico with $3.84 per cent at the top of a kilowatt.
After the end of the campaign, the press conference, which was organised by the Energy and Natural Resources Bank Berat, pointed out that the region of the German company Siemens's win is an important message to the world, "I think that this will also provide an important part for Turkey-Germany's relations with Turkey and Germany in the light of 200 years of historical cooperation."
Our goals are great.
Today's net economy and energy market has focused on how healthy and safe it is for the future.
No matter how much regional crises are in the world, I've heard a great deal about the fact that Turkey's region and the world's most reliable investment countries come into being.
"In this picture we will be proud of 80 million in all Turkey, the biggest part, within 15 years and leadership, is our President, who will take Turkey to this point."
He said: "One of the most important steps to this, one of the world's most important steps, is to pay $10.3 per kilowattate per kilowattate at the top of the world's average, with a historical record of $3.48 per cent, with a world record price."
I'm proud of this, for my people's sake, for my country's sake.
Speaking of their intention to take the first local production panels into the solar energy by the end of 2018, Mr. Albay said, "We will include our local production classes into the system by 2019."
The classes will be established in five designated areas.
The company that won the contest in each of these five regions will receive at least 50 megastats of wind power as a thousand megastats in my collection.
Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon's total investment will be over $1 billion.
With local wind stations operating, 3 billion kilowatts of electricity will be produced each year, and about 1.1 million homes will be equipped with the electricity needed annually.
The average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions will also be provided by the wind pumps to be installed.
The company that won the competition will set up a factory with an investment of $100 million.
The average production of at least 2.3 megastats in the factory will be 300 to 450 average local wind types.
The Consortium, the canal, the generator design, hardware technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and youth practice will work in Ar-Ge for at least three years in at least 5 fields.
As each year divides the $5 million budget for Ar-Ge's work, 50 technical staff from local engineers will work 80 percent.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license period is 30 years.
In my group that won the case, Turkey's Executive Director, President of the Construction Foundation of Turkey, announced that local production would be 64 percent around the project and that it would come from the site of the team at 35 percent, "We plan to secure the funding of teams from foreign sources, but the rest of them from local banks."
Turkey indicated that the agency had lost its confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalion Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata has become a myth that will reduce Turkey's external dependence on thousands of megastats."
He said, "You're happy with the end."
Siemens Gamesa Governor Hakan of Turkey said that he had been active in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We will do what we can to reduce the electricity unit's assets."
It's gonna be 65 percent of the area where the windmills are to be built in the factory.
In the wind type, there will be 65 per cent of the 8 000 industrial parts (at least 5,200).
In each of the 5 regions, at least 50 MW, a total of 1,000 MW will be established.
3,750 people want 10 years of Ar-Ge's obligation to spend $5 million each year on Ar-Ge's operations.
1.000MW Windshield %65 Local location At least 2.3 MWe is the production of 300 and 450 standard local wind type.
I invest over $1 billion a year in 400 MW/year windscreen production capacity, and I invest in a factory over a hundred million dollars.
Nearly 1.1 million households will need electricity every year at an average of 3 billion kWh electricity production average of 1.5 million tonnes CO2/year emissions.
Moore's Ford Catalyst: Activists Adalete Initiated the Injury Linch Case Again
In 1948 a model ford Mercuriy was passed by a group of observers in the area of Monroe Georgia and moved directly to the small Ford Küprus in Moore.
A vehicle with four black passengers and a white driver was set up to stop a group of white men armed before they reached the bridge.
A middle-aged middle-aged Indian teamman with a man in his suit took a long breath out of his pocket and carefully looked inside from the front window.
Inside, those sitting in fear.
"That's what we want, Roger!" he said.
"Get him out of here!"
When a young black man ran off his front passenger seat, he was in darkness.
Well, don't just reanimate this game on the 22nd of June.
But when a science was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone asked a real question.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to Ford's Ford Square in Moore (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) to renew their contact with Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one's been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped reorganize the reorganization, said: "We see them in our communities and we don't realize that there has been one person arrested for all these years."
"It's a hard date, but it's a burden on our souls."
When Brooks was 71 years old, an old Georgian state was a congressman and a defender of human rights throughout his life.
This reanimation, a dramatic call for action, and an annual reminder that an injustice has never been corrected in Monroe's population.
He said: "We want to fight. We want to win. We want to be defeated. We want to get out of here, but we must be first to act with justice."
"We can't have it until we get justice."
On 27 September 1946, the trial was held by a judge on the body of one of the victims of the Ford Linc in Moore.
According to FBI files from NBC News, More than 50 of Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected of being in contact.
But one of them has never been questioned.
Despite being a fugitive for ten years, the suspects say that human rights defenders and the couple's two motivations are always very well known everywhere in the city: politics and sex.
In November 1946, a high court judge in Georgia was first able to vote in the election at the end of that letter.
According to the FBI, black partner Roger Malcom, who was elected at the same time, hit Barnett Hester as a woman in a white land during a fight.
Brooks; the city's saying that Hester slept with Dorothy's wife and her baby was not his own husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 December 1946, Loy Harrison, a white land owner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins went to prison at George Dorsey's rehab.
But when they came to Ford Küprus, Moore, while he was away from the prison, there was a chain around the car.
A FBI report concludes, "It's understood that Harrison was the one who ordered the murder."
"And of course there was a secret agreement between the state and the local authorities that they did not only take refuge in the murder, destroyed the evidence, and hid the identity of the witnesses of torture."
Brooks said it's too short.
He said: "This was my right to cry."
All of them were killed to send a message to the people of the black town, saying, "This will be for you if you give a record of it and let your voice be heard."
For nearly ten years Cassandra Greene has managed to re-live the Ford Küprus contacts in Moore, where each year it happens.
The performance is blind to all the details, and it's based on some kind of serious distortion that many people believe they're no longer in America.
It's hard to track and even to turn their views, but Greene says it's the goal.
He said, "We don't want to talk about sex because it's embarrassing us all."
"If you don't listen to me or if you don't hear what's going on with me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The evidence of this year's performance began to appear, and the first day of the 30th day an actor (one level white and black) entered a room and listened when Greene wanted to enter the best-tested general lines of the game.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant manager of Greene.
President Clansman has played his role for years, but he says his role is never easy.
Marbough said, "I feel upset because it's not me."
"I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back then."
Players playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester all over the room were trying their own lines, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
Malcom starts playing with Hester, who's so upset that he's sleeping with Dorothy's wife.
"I said, get out of my kingdom!"
Rascona's making a point.
There's an explosion.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) falls into chaos.
The most funny Greene.
Rascona says "What?"
It was amazing. It was amazing.
Am I too serious?
Greene said "No" inside the cuts.
"I just don't think that white people say "z...i."
One of the black players threw a crossstone with "Yes."
"You have to print 'R'."
So the energy in the room changes and replaces some kind of resistance.
Everyone is trying to do this right, not just for the game line, but for the mother of the four people who were killed at the same time.
The scene's starting again.
This time Rascona N says the word she started with, cut and shoot.
No one's definitely laughing.
The reanimation is violent and fast.
There's noise, gunfire and then silence.
A woman on the funeral list is standing on the bodies of the actors and reading Billie Holiday's comic book "Garip Meyva".
The sound is broken in one of the two words.
An average of one hundred yards away from the eyes of a four-order watch group and wipes out their eyes.
It's almost the same degree of black and white.
A couple came from New York to see her performance, from Ithaca, most of the way.
When Brooks drove them to the shrines of Malcom and Dorsey, they all stopped Georgia's printing business for almost eight hours.
To this point, the murders have remained anecdotes, but now that they're in the same place as yours, it's like the air's coming down like a curse.
When the last notes of the scar are weakened, Greene invites the majority to approach and inject their bodies.
The kids are sucking up on their hands, spilling innocent blood and beating each other.
A little boy like he reminds himself, "They're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the rest of us and stops.
Actors are throwing the wire line and they're putting their eyes out.
Bradshaw, the team that's playing President Klansman's dress goes to Marbaugh.
Nick Rascona's playing with two of his friends, and they're getting old out of their hands, and he's finally getting a sense of performance.
One of the women screams, "It's okay."
"We know what is in your heart is not.
You did it for some reason."
Later on, the spectators are eating with the actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta talk about reanimation with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski has to find words about how she feels about her performance.
He said: "These are dreadful words and shameful words, and such deeds are from people who look like you, and they do so because they are like you."
"What this has done to me is to think that the cops are still doing," he added, "it's only called the police armed attacks."
There's a living room on the floor of the room at Tyrone Brooks' table, and it's a very interesting room.
He said he started planning his performance next year.
He said, "It is inspired in me that I should be a witness to what we are engaged in, but he is also a teacher."
"Sanki, if you don't learn from this, it's like it's possible again.
Those who do not know their past are doomed to repeat it."

AK Party to a specific website
By AK Party, 6.
The "akkongrelere.com" website was installed for the upcoming Congress process.
On the Web site, the party organisation has placed brochures, materials and charts that will be used during this period.
The rules to be applied during the conference were set out in Chapter 14 of the website 'A Communication Strategy'.
The head of the party's online message and General President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, who was posted on the website, have been notified of the organization's compliance with the party's organizational identity during the congress.

Pearson did more than 3,000 jobs to boost his practice, but his car broke down.
When Britain's educational group Pearson started another redesigning program to get over the hundreds of face-to-face prints, he said he'd do more than 3,000 jobs on Friday, and he'd cut the middle part by 72 percent.
According to Chief Director John Fallon, most of the work that will be completed by 2018 and 2019 will be added to the 4,000 lost positions at the beginning of the first reassessment.
In May, Pearson set out a plan to redesign 300 million pounds (394 million U.S.) in an attempt to speed up digital learning with a third loan program.
Penguin Random House, a company that agreed to sell its share to Bertelsmann last month, said that there was no change in the outlook of this year's market for the first half of its basic sales.
The text took two more deaths!
According to the first report of the Court of Justice Tüp, Hakan was sentenced to death by the first outbreak of the autopsy report.
The detailed injection did not detect any scratch or fracture in the child’s body.
The reason for this is that it's the result of the collapse of the elastic band that has led to the fall.
It has also been noted that the family's family's fate has been defined as the kind of elegance used in injuries.
According to the Newspaper, after a detailed report on the child's death has been prepared by the Muslim Sariyar, it is learned that the case is being submitted to the Grand Public Prosecutor who is conducting a survey of the case.
When the police are investigating the child's pregnancy with all its details, they're also carrying intrusion on the computer they're talking about after the incident.
It's said the police are going to follow the statement by Hakan's friends.
It's also said that Hakan can access third-persons or a block with information from his computer called "Cleaned" by his neighbors.
The police estimate that Hakan may have been driven by an intifara.
Hakan's conviction has turned to the harsh Text2.
In 2009, when he was 13 years old, he was murdered by the "minik hacker" Textin Kang, who had been murdered by a 15-year-old boy in Antalya Valigía, who was treated with the need for independence and violence in children.
To play Text2 created in Korea in 2005 you need to log in and register as a member.
Players are trying to provide peace and justice in the world with their God-given god in the game.
As we do this, there's wars, there's more violence.
The game also takes place on the side of war scenes made with weapons such as sword, ball, ball, ball and ball, which are played by wild animals.

Father Mehmet II said, "We don't think it could harm him or anyone else because of the game," he said, "They've broken my neck with an elegance."
That's how it was, my son.
We certainly don't think that our son can harm himself or anyone else because of a game on the Internet.
We knew you were playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game of art.
Let's say he left some blood out of the game.
Mother Güllizar Second, "There's no way out of me."
It's been said that my child went home for an hour.
None of them hold each other.
When he came home, he had only one chair.
He said, "But there were two chairs with the computer when he was in his funeral."
The first caraş: It may have broken to the edge
Families usually don't pay attention to this.
They're looking at "What's going on at my child's house?"
Boy, through games, he's been communicating with a lot of people.
It may have been a debt or a denial.
Or someone in the game invited you home, maybe there's a problem between them.
It may have been because of problems with other people who have been associated with the game, not with the game directly.
The vision of the game, the boy may have thought it was real.
The travesty that's driving the intira may be related to the play.
If he's faced with the situation of family abuse, there's a situation in which he can't solve the problem.
The game isn't about to be overrun by itself.
And it's probably a word about breaking into your child's back.
He's probably stuck to the wall.
There's nothing that your child can have done on his own.
Communication of information systems Füsun NEBIL: Families need to know how their children are affected
We can't say the games are bad.
Research has also shown that games are useful for children's development.
What's important here is what parents play and how they talk to players online.
Families need to know how the children are affected by the ingredients.
There are only two kids in the five years he said he died from the game in Turkey.
This also shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of games.
What happened to this kid?
We need to know this first.
You have to look at sociology and psychology around your child.
Borssa stayed in Istanbul for eight months, 50 percent.
BIST 100 Indians continued the rise trend that began in 2016 in the month of July and moved it up to 8 months above.
So since September 2007, this first eight months of high record has been 45.3 percent won.
From the beginning of the year, Germany, the United States, England, and Japan have not left their leadership on the basis of BIST 100 indexes, which have been the world's leading players in the past month.
In the United States, 2,54 percent of BIST 100 indexes completed in October, and 0.81 percent followed FTSE 100 indexes in England.
The DAX index in Germany and the Nikkei index in Japan ended up with a loss of the month of July.
In view of the slow-to-mute period, BIST has seen a higher performance than that of 100 Indians, mainly from world exchanges and developing countries.
According to the 2016 peak, the BIST 100 index won by 37.6 percent, the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10,76 percent, the DAX index with a 5.55-value winner, the Nike index with a 4.55-high rate, and the FTSE 100 index by 3.21 percent.
The MSCI EM index in the target of the show on the national interest rates in the developing world has provided 23 percent.
In the past BIST was seen showing similar performances in the historical period of the 100 index.
Between September 2006 and September 2007, BIST 100 endpoints were recorded at an increase of 38.3 per cent.
BIST 100 indexes from August 1996 to March 8, 1997 and 9 months from October 1998 have also been won.
In his statement to AA's manager Eren Can Ummüt, he indicated that the BIST 100 index continued to rise for 8 months, and that this increase was still higher than 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
In general, the MSCI development market index (EM) recorded 23 percent higher, and the value was positive even when we looked at these situations:
The flow of money to developing countries has continued this since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds in high-level communications are preferable to countries with higher rates of interest.
In this case, domestic markets are being positive.
Of course, the risk-taking factor in the global dimension is a very high figure.
In this regard, he welcomes the document indexes found in the risk status of the asset.
In the U.S., S&P 500 index year, we see that the new record levels have been tested in parallel to 11 percent of this year's record.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) reported that the 3 percent increase in market stress was caused by the U.S. government, but that Fed's policy of direct movement was very well used to eliminate uncertainty from the middle of the market.
Well, the U.S. said that inflation was not yet at the desired level, that Fed would not act faster on the increase in fertility and that expectations would avoid radical brains would also have a significant impact on existing prices.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that he had strengthened the commitment that the U.S. health reform known as "Obamacare" would not be able to fulfill its broad-based financial policy promises, said "The faster U.S. economic expectations for Trump, the faster they feel about the real market, the faster that promises will be fulfilled and the faster inflation will be given."
In view of the fact that Turkey's markets are experiencing a year of instability in 2016, Mr. Ommet said that the different closure effort was in line with the comparisons of BIST 100 separate and oversaled indexes.
The State that indicated that they did not see a strong collection of information from inside news sources has reported that there could be an impact on the different types of domestic markets in terms of the increase in the presence of the presence of risk abroad.
Well, it's technically reported that BIST 100 index BIST testing new records with 108,600 levels, and that it's a lot of steel sales:
In particular, 109,500-110,000 districts are critically critical.
It's normal to be able to do iron sales after they're close to these levels.
In the short run, we think that there should be a new local or global story for over 110,000 sales.
Now, the drop of 107,500 supports can trigger steel sales.
I think if we follow the 107,000 average support in this situation, we're going to be able to see the ratio up to 106,000-105.500.
In particular, the breakdown of 105.500 support can result in a decrease of 104.300 to 104.300, which accounts for 50 percent of Fibo's elevation from 100,000 to 108.600.
Both Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) indicated that decisions will be at the end of the world market at the end of the month, the United Nations said that it would be possible for FED to be able to increase the rate of income in FOMC, although it is not expected to increase in the year.
Hopefully, the country (GOY) in the developing world in the short term will be able to attract black market sales in document indexes, "What will the ECB say if it is really important with this?"
Following the founding meeting of the monetary policy, President Mario Draghi of the ECB asked them to discuss the view of the monetary policy in the future, and this statement made it possible to raise the level of the euro/dollar parity of 1,1700.
As a result, the related explanations that will reduce or end the $60 billion monthly loan programme will also mean that it will also be reduced by the ECB's after-Fed capital in the world.
"The prices of countries with high prices such as Turkey and the need for access to external phones can be seen in the evaluation."
The Go Investment Communication Manager Erol Gürcan also pointed out that after the election of the U.S. President Trump in September 2016, there was a very serious reaction from the opening of global awareness document markets.
Gürkan, the basic element that stimulates this rally movement, said that it is possible to increase global growth expectations by making it possible for Trump to submit tax commitments to the head of the tax system:
Borsa Istanbul also took place on the top of the bridges leading to the world rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is to say that BIST 100 indexes have been very popular in countries with similar progress in recent years, but political makers have also played a significant role in supporting economic and financial markets.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) index, which became active in March, has a significant impact on the high level currently investigated by the mother.
In the last part of the year, Gürkan, who said that the positive developments were on a significant scale and that KGF, which played an important role in this high priority, had reached a slow pace of growth, said that BIST 100 Indians were still in the same position as other countries' markets, although a new story for the rest of the year could be gradually developed.
The 180-day action plan, which was expected to share the details for a particular period of time, stated that there would be progress in terms of restructuring of company cars such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, such as the increase in the number of companies, as well as the fact that there is a tax rate that is likely to occur in the near future.
The fact that key national central banks, such as the Central Bank of Greece, Fed, the ECB and the United Kingdom, are slow and slow to tighten up existing monetary policy situations, and that they are still at risk for developing countries, "will not be able to start a very high-probably low-rate fiscal process in the coming months, and that the ECB will soon be able to finalise its current collection programme, and that it will be expected to be in line with the key developed central banks of the BOE, which will continue to be in this sense."
In our pre-indication actions, Greece, who said that the area of support, which is very critical to the 200-hour average with the rise trend seen earlier this year, is very critical, has indicated that this support region can continue to be at 101,700, 100,000 and 99,200 levels.
In the case of the division of 108,605 lines at the existing level of the existing high school, the Gürcan indicated that the index could increase to 110,000-12,000.
A cable convoy attack: NATO soldiers were killed in an attack
According to the authorities, an Indian bomber in Kabul attacked the army, killed a NATO soldier, and wounded a few.
He said in his NATO statement that five soldiers and a translation were injured.
Untended local sources say that three civilians died in the event in the Karabakh region.
The last act of violence that took place in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died on a fire in Herat on Saturday.
On Tuesday, a terrorist bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement indicated that the attack was carried out by 'personally reliable hand-helding firer' during the night explosion with the Afghan army.
He explained that all the wounded were in good condition and that they were under treatment at the U.S. Air Force Hospital.
The bloggers say the Taliban is an important source of concern to NATO forces speaking near the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh.
According to the United Nations in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the death of at least 1662 civilians on average.
At the end of October, a terrorist bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's most part of the district in Şi.
The Taliban said they were carrying out their attack.
On 31 May, after the U.S. leadership forces deplored Taliban power in 2001, more than 150 people were killed by a major bombing in the city center during the most deadly military attack in the country.
In addition, U.S. President Donald Trump, while stressing the seriousness of increasing the number of United States units contributing to the country's military and police support, is undermining the precarious security situation in Afghanistan.
In the last few weeks, delegates have said that the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's trust in the conflict has led to a crisis.
EPA refused to break the incoming air law after the cases
The U.S. Environment Protection Council, an Obama rule, decided to postpone the law which called for the ban on emissions from the poor state, followed by a day later by a 15-state constitution that refused this entry.
The EPA expressed its determination to work with the states on Tuesday afternoon and explained its decision to continue with "The Ozon Decisions" on Wednesday.
EPA President Scott Pruitt said, "We believe in dialogue with our government partners and not being sensitive to them."
In the month of Pruitt's arrival, the EPA's ozone decision was announced for a year until October 2018; its presence is measured at various locations in the country and it is decided where it needs to be determined to meet more stringent air quality standards.
Mostly, with 15 states that are democratic, there was a case that stated that this effort was illegal on the part of Colombia's province.
President Donald Trump's administration is making an effort to restore the broad-based environmental arrangements that were carried out by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider day-to-day effort to boost the economic growth of Trump.
But these efforts have led to the attitude of the security groups concerned about the effects of democracy and more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says that "the ozone-induced atmosphere may decrease its function and increase its symptoms as low as mine."
He gave me the good news...
It's a series of stops and canal transfers!
President Fikret Orman, a footballer, Jeremiahain Lens and Stopper, in the Netherlands, found Bein Sports in his statements on the transfer.
The thought of Orman said these things...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
Our target isn't too much transfer, it's a point shot.
Now we're gonna make a stopper and a canal transfer.
We've got Ligi matches, we're gonna make a good deal of it.
We're gonna have to transfer the mecbur.
10 million Euros are very easy, but we don't have a bottle like that.
If it comes to what we say, we'll transfer it or we won't die if we don't.
I can't give you any information about Lens before it's over.
We're an open company.
Welcome to the end of your patience.
Didn't it just happen for August 30th?
The Anchora Valiígíi continues to legitimize the sit-in behaviour, memory meetings and similar community activities throughout August, with the need for "ICHID threatened".
While the term "all the collective activities" takes place in the family's legal decision, Ankara's 7th.
The Great Ankara Festival continues.
In his statement to the CHP Group on Presidential and Ankara-Miletted Levent Heaven, the CHP said "the effect of August 30 on the law is inevitable" and said:
There's a serious headache.
Even in the state of tertiary about which decision it will apply...
The task of the government is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
The CHP Ankara Milletvekite Murat Emir said, "The whole Ankara has a security issue, only the heavenly organizations have a security issue."
Ankara has transferred the law to McClis, Nazlika, independent of the State.
The president's statement said to Nazlili, "Is this law not a clear violation of AKP's amnesty and Father's hostility? How do you think you would stop the millions who will celebrate August 30 in the fields?"
"I learned from Edwina in the face of what I was deceived."
Démet Shener, who continued his divorce with Kutluay, was in his first day's lawyer's residence with the original Hatemi.
Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have destroyed her house, presented the case to Shener, who opened a case of manic surgery with Sponza, as evidenced that her photo taken with Kutluay was taken to court.
Sociologically beautiful Sponza was found in the Schener case, saying, "Demet took my special photos illegally."
'I DIDN'T KNOW.'
After this last development, Shener, who was in Délicatessen's office after his lawyer, appeared out of nowhere.
Shener, who was very generous, smiled, remembering Edwina Sponza's idea of the photos, saying, "God must have taken me home."
The real Hatemi is about Sponza's complaint, "There's such a complaint, but it's not true."
He said, "We've got everything. We've got it to court."
Shener, reporters, "Then everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza."
"How did you not know?" she was surprised at the question.
What?
How?
Shenner, who said, "I don't know," said, "Would I believe what my husband says or believe in what my uncle says?"
Sheener, who said "No" before the reporters insisted, "Didn't you hear anything?" continued, "I didn't say it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I didn't believe anything like that in any way.
Everything was normal, it was there; there was nothing to doubt.
Ma'am, I've learned everything by sending everything to my hand, so...
"Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" Sheener, who gave the "Yes" address to the question, was very confused by the pictures and the writings he ordered in court, assuming that Sponza was sending them away.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with the Holy One was in conflict with Abraham.
The deal will be signed with Negredo tomorrow
The Spanish football club will include Alvaro Negredo in the official framework tomorrow.
The Vodafone Park will be organised for Negredo, who agreed in principle on the transfer with the Valencia Club of Spain.
The signature form of the club's head will also be signed by Fikret Orman at 12 noon.
In the meantime, the Spanish footballer will also pass his health control tomorrow morning.
Qatar: Ambargo was shot by Turkey in hours
Katar Economics and Ticaret Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said they wanted to express their gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al-Thani said: "I thank you very much for your honour and for your support to us."
I welcome my brother Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan to the Chief of Staff.
Qatar's economy has demonstrated its resurrection.
In many countries, when we're affected by economies, our economy is going to be healthy.
We have to work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke the ambargo that was made against us for hours in Turkey.
We don't have any trouble at all right now.
The natural resources that we have are to give great support to Qatar's economy.
We were not affected by a blockade that was carried out against us without pain and laws.
Today, Qatar is born again, and he continues to be born in LNG around the world.
He said, "It's not like we're going to have an increase of 30 percent after the arrivals."
Al Thani, pointing out that work continues to be done in all areas with brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey, said, "The first round of trade has created a $554 million debt."
This has also played an important role in recent decisions.
As a result of the production of Turkey in Qatar's market, it is important for us to speed up the entry of goods from Turkey and to make investments in a number of areas.
He said, "Thank you very much for your arrests against us."
It's 300 million TLs.
TSB President Can Akyun Chiğals indicated that 116 million TL 7 000 accidents were reported to security companies after the 18th of December, 12 million injuries were received at Gömkova on 21st of December, and 168 million injuries were reported in Istanbul on 27th of December, and 168 million injuries were reported on 2nd of the last three cases, with 300 million injuries.
The boys say, "The damage caused by the accident insurance is worth 3,000 litres per vehicle, and the damage is about a thousand litres."
He said, "If I'm depressed, it's the average cost of six thousand lira."
The Red Cross, who claimed that they had spent their efforts as a sector for the management of economic losses, said that each of the 4 people had no security security, that each of them had no new security, and that each of the 3 people had no safe security, said, "The natural risk of science's change is growing."
Because of the low-security environment in our country, the risk of meeting with our fellow citizens and our institutions is increasing every day.
All these assets should not be left on the government.
The insurance policy is not as expensive as the insurance policy is, nor is it just a sector that pays damage; at the same time, it is talking about risk management.
The increase in security science and security is very important for our people and for our country.
Jean Akyun Choys, "The Kasko insurance says that the insurance needs to be reported to the insurance companies within 5 working days, and this time it's over."
"Is it gonna be a security gain?" he said, "Even if it's been such a long time under general conditions, it's been two years under the Ticaret Act."
He said, "And these old people don't have to panic, so they don't have to panic, they don't say I don't pay any company."
That's how the German media saw the whole story!
During a time when there was an increase in tension between Turkey and Germany, Turkey's first Energy Renewable Energy Areas (YEKA) was concerned about Germany's winning the German Siemens company.
The German media heard this development saying, "Alman Siemens won the case in Turkey."
DWelle Turkish, told the U.K.A. that her Siemens-Turkers-Kaliyon Consortium had won, said, "The Consortium will invest more than $1 billion in electricity."
"The fact that I am open to the creation of the power of megarate wind is that Turkey's first JEKA power is no longer unique" is said to have been taken out of the case when the number of companies that have competed from 8 to 2 today, against the Chinese and German Siemens Consortiums, and when the Chinese Mingyang Consortium started on 30th.
After the trial, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat, who made an explanation, found himself in urgent statements on relations between Turkey and Germany.
Ihale, the German company has won Siemens, and we can say that this is an important message for the official area and the world.
As we also look at the 200-year historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this will provide an important element in Turkey-Germany's relations.
I've heard a great deal of pride about the fact that the region of Turkey and the world's most reliable investment has come to the head of this issue.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, they meet a potential passenger
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia met with them on the first Thursday of Friday when they were about 147 pounds.
The World Box Council was held in separate rooms in Los Angeles' ESPN offices until the World Box Organization was in its corridor.
On the Wednesday of the showtime, together with the moon, the old world champion Adrien Bronner of four cycles, followed by Garcia's death, between the best five members of the list that were not monitored by the bike.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will be held at ESPN on Saturday night against Miguel Marriaga.
When the two were missing for photos, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, recorded that a potential competitor among combatants would be "greatly large".
Garcia, he reminded me "I'm an old chicken bike."
"I went high for Bronner (140 pounds) but I'm not that big.
I'm a little boy for 140.
I want to get into a light cycle.
He's got to go through a low cycle of 135 pounds, then we can fight.
That's what the interviewers want.
We'll give them that."
Lomachenko was involved.
"I'm sorry I need this fight."
The climate asked whether this should be in 'opportunity and watch; to set up another written history and fight against Lomachenko in a 135-pound event this year; and Garcia is interested in fighting the possibility of meeting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for a soft cycle address at the Forum on 23 September.
Garcia said, "The fight may be in 'opportunity and watch 'cause all parties want it." And then what channel would offer her the best financial package?
We're the main names.
No other name makes such a difference.
When they're ready...
Garcia Lomachenko said he appointed him "a muazzam fighter" and was able to join him on Saturday.
But Lomachenko, who was in a lot of trouble with Garcia, and he said that he thought that three cycles from Riverside seemed "very slow" and said, "I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked for it."
Garcia said she was a box after showing up in front of the room.
They both said they felt they were created for their own encounters.
"This is a fight to be done.
Another fight doesn't make so much concern and saying.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to meet you."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey.
There'll be a great fight."
Turkish restaurant from Russia to America
White Saray doesn't think about implementing measures to affect Moscow's red line constructions, but it can increase the ownership of these lines.
The reason for this is the increase in debt.
In contrast, Kremlin, who was concerned that the construction of the independent investment partners was planning to get rid of the projects, accelerated the construction of the bourgeois line.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which had built the Turkish Real Estate line that was planned to reach Turkey under Karadeniz, rushed to build on the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that in order to make more gas available to Europe, it also began to build a second bridge line parallel to the "aceley" of Turkey.
The new results of the Swedish evaluation test were opened
The most recent results of the evaluation tests by doctors based on a new medical age assessment in Sweden are that more than 80 percent of those enrolled in the test are older than 18 years of age, but not everyone is convinced that these tests are true.
The Swedish National Adli Tüp and Medical Administration (Rättsmedicineverket) started testing earlier this year.
Tests were designed to correct the age assessment over a period of time after the failure of some of the experts who claimed that the Swedish Immigration Network was not a part of their migration network.
So far, the Migration Network has sent a 680-year-old test, and the Adli Tüp and the Medical Department has now explained the end of the 2481-day period from mid-March to 31 December 2017.
The 80th (2002 rate) was judged to be over 18 or above, but at the age of 25, the trial was "probably over 18 and over."
At 432 years of age, he was probably under 18.
Tests were done only in the caves where the man's age was suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson from the Medical and Medical Department, the results have been over the past months.
He said to The Local, "We haven't seen a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are very high."
It does not mean that those who are judged to be older than the 18-year-olds are lying about the age of their masters.
In May, he explained the outcome of the 581 test, and he said that "it was shown that the infected were older or older than 18 years old" 442.
When Svenska Dagbladet reported the results of 581 years, 243 years of age revealed that he had entered this year at the age of 18.
A medical evaluation of the 20-year-old teeth ring and the design of the MRI plugs, and later analysis of these to dentists and radiologists, is carried out in some circles.
One of the suspects is Dr. Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who evaluated the biological nature of people who were working on it earlier or later.
"I have reasons to think about it and I think that this kind of measurement should not be used.
It's a lot of doubt to make decisions about biological life in this way.
If we can't say it at all, we shouldn't do it like that." Metro said to the newspaper.
What is more, the Court of Justice and the Medical Department defended the validity of Göransson's tests: "You can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is generally small.
The greatest risk is that the person under 18 is under 18 years of age, and in this case, the risk is about 10 percent."
Star Hamidye Camisi is opening up to worship today
The Star Hamidiye Camisi, held in 1885 by Abdühamit, is to be opened in worship today after the restaurant's work.
The District Director Mursel said that the restaurant work that began in March 2013 was completed and the truck was ready to be opened.
"Restauration work was conducted in two pockets."
The first part of the truck was the repair of the mother's building.
The second part was the environmental adjustment.
In the first part, about 16 million lira were spent around 11 million lira for environmental planning.
The arrows of the dove were first opened, and after they had been repaired, the outer walls and the entrances of the outer wall were enlarged.
There's been a health clinics.
There's a lot of money on what we see when we get in the truck.
It's a series of stars, and it's very rich in the way of writing.
There's a tough way here.
"And we're going to think it was done in the Osman and in 1885 at the beginning of the baroque movement."
THE WAY OF HAPPINESS
"The law of the German Emperor, found in the middle of the street."
There were some errors, he was re-cleaned and replaced.
It's really a very valuable and important piece.
There's a symmetrical coffee on both sides of the truck, and we say peace.
We know this is done by our great-grandfather, Abdühamit Han.
So we know how he did this with his own hands and how he was mounted here.
They're still standing here as original.
Siri said, as soon as the truck opened, President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan was expected to participate.
Pantic Idea on Boztepe
The Ukrainian press wrote that a 25-year-old Srp footballer who didn't enter the theater in Dinoma Kiev could be hired into a red club.
The country of Futbola wore Pantic, in Spain, Villareal, Cordoba, Ibar and Alaves forms, which began in the Red Star team of Serbia.
Pantic was signed by Dinamo Kiev during the last season.
West Virginia states that she will change her party
West Virginia, President of Democracy Jim Justice Pershembe evening, said he would change his meeting party with President Trump.
Vali Justice said, "You either go or you don't go, the Democrats left me."
"I'll tell you today with a lot of prayer and thought... I'll tell you today as the West Virgins, I can't help you as a Democrat anymore."
The meeting was covered with performances.
Justice added, "So I'll change my record tomorrow as a Community citizen."
"If I was a technical director, it's time for you to play a different game, I said."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia meeting.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and he didn't support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billion people in the world were elected in 2016.
Forbes indicates that he owns five herders of her father's farm.
It's about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the United Nations Congress released an explanation on Friday evening, "The Vali Justice's change of party is another job for the Democratic Party, which is more likely to prevent it from expanding our country than it is to increase its country."
When RNC woman spoke to Ronna McDaniel CBS, she said, "The story is only the last rejection of a party that doesn't lead to a positive, united message."
I'll do my best for Turkey.
The third Olympic, Turkey's record.
She was born in Cuba, but she appointed Turkey as her own holiday for the F.B.
In 2013 he became a Turkish citizen and wore the international form...
First it became a European champion, then the third Olympic...
Now one of Turkey's most important prizes at the World Championship for Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who fought 400 metres in the barrier, spoke to Sabah before the campaign to begin today.
They didn't want you when you were young that you didn't like their levels in Cuba.
You've developed what the coach is holding.
Then they called, but you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was being separated from the international team.
I could say I drew a line from what I've been living in since then.
Then I went to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbach Club.
I joined the National Team and it was because of Fenerbach.
They offered me an offer for the calendar.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I've lived a long time in my youth, but I've signed important successes in Rio and Amsterdam after the opportunities I have served me in Turkey.
I'm impatient to do my best at the World Athletic Championship and win a different reputation.
You were crying at a press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
When a question is raised about Turkey's going out with me, my childhood comes to mind, I'm leaving the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And of course people are coming to me in Turkey.
When I won a gold medal at the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt something like this when I was playing School March.
I couldn't keep my eyes.
I am very grateful to Turkey for allowing my dreams to be realized.
I'm so glad we belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you could have a Turkish lover before.
You're with a Turk right now, you're going to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what they're living in?
The greatest peace of being with a Turk is...
It's quiet when I'm dealing with pregnant women...
The Turkish girls are in contact.
You train your girlfriend's assistant at the same time.
You're with me all day long. Is that what you're talking about?
She eats more sweet than I do.
I don't mean to say it's really hard, but it's time for me to eat.
My coach Massimo Matrone is often in severe warnings, but I know these are for my own good.
How about your Turkish food? Does your boyfriend cook for you?
It makes Turkish women eat very good, but it makes my love better.
(Laughter) That's the first choice I ever had.
I WAS JUST A LITTLE TIPS.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He's got other guys in my place.
We met in Cuba after we won the medals for Turkey.
He showed me to the young sportsmen who were next to me and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
MY PAST: I grew up in a family of my own.
It's interesting what you're looking at in the competition...
I'm just using it for concentration.
When I look at it, I cut off my relationship with the world and hit both sides of the wall.
I'm just focusing on the exit line and I don't see anything else.
WHAT comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
In 2012, London Olympics won a gold medal at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33 years of age, why not?
TURKCELL DESTRUCTION
Mr. Ismail, Deputy Director General of Turkey, said that Yasmani Capello believed that he would succeed in London, "We sincerely believe that Yasman will best represent our country at this seminar."
We're going to make it possible for all our athletes to compete in London.
He said, "We will support Turkey's further development and greater success in our country."
Coe, Russia's "samimi" for the doping scandal
The world's athletic boss Sebastian Coe said that the doping scandal had been identified as Russia's own currency, but the country's track was not right to be re-accepted.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress, which was organized at the World Athletes Championship, that it was right to be banned from sports and that it was determined to fight his own good.
He said, "I'm sorry about all the athletes who took gold and silver from them."
In response to its assessment, the IAAF Congress adopted a vote in favour of the law following the finding of evidence of state-supported doping in Russia by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in March 2015.
The IAAF President Coe said to the delegates, "I think it's a very good idea today, I think it's a very good idea."
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased to do everything possible to ensure that the Russian Federation accepted itself, that it had spent the most exciting days and that the Federation had done everything possible to ensure that it was rebuilt."
Coe, Russia, said "me" before he accepted the criteria he accepted again.
Coe said, "I think it's a very creative day and I think it's been taken, but Congress is supporting the failure of the power of the mission to extend Russia's rights."
"We have to do everything to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The road guide has always wanted us to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system."
The 19th Russian athlete who meets the IAAF criteria will be competing in the World Athletic Championship on Friday, London.
On the day of the launch of the IAAF mission, Rune Andersen said that Russia had not yet met many criteria for the membership of its rights.
The IAAF Council told the delegates that the drug test was still insufficient and that legal trainers were still working freely.
Don't lie to ABD to 'YPG'
The U.S. Anchora Majesty explained that no tank was given to any part of the war in Syria.
The idea that hundreds of tanks and weapons were sent down to YPG was false.
The mission's main explanation of the wrong news about the floods in Syria was:
In the last few days, it has been claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the U.S.
The news is that some fundamental facts about the existence of Syria are beyond sight.
The U.S. didn't give any troops to fight Deasha in Syria.
A major part of the United States' military assistance in small arms and light weapons is to support the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The SAK is also fighting to clean up and relocate their homes from the sea.
TYDTA President Ermut: The real foreign investment is over last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said the entire investment last year was 55 percent after last month.
15 And Ermut, who realized that there was no decrease in investment due to FETÜ's entry into employment, said, "Maybe there would be more to it, two to it."
If there were no such conditions, if there were no regional developments, we could see more than the impact of the hurricane.
That's why we hope more for the year ahead.
It's gonna be a more bright year in the sense of real investment.
By the first five months, we're going up 11 percent by the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope it's more." He used his words.
Ermut pointed out that people around the world, if necessary, do not care about regional developments, but they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut continued his words, usually recalling that 75 percent of real investments came from Europe by 2010:
This number fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share grew from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, there were some problems between the Kurfez countries.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
But the problem between these two countries is that we're sorry, and it's going to make investors' decisions a little bit more complicated.
It's not just investment in Turkey, so we might be living a few moments.
Ermut later recalled that some events had occurred in Germany last week, but your government, particularly President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, has shown a clear and firm response to this situation.
When speaking to investors in countries with the worst political crisis, President Erdoğan's reaction was, "The problems are between governments, and there will certainly be no one among peoples."
Second, these people came and invested in the country.
It's no different from the Turkish companies for us.
They'll come to us when they're the least problems, we'll solve them.
Ermut, who said, "We will certainly not allow them to be rich." He said, "They will continue to support all investors with their peace.
Ermut says, "We can trust this in our time."
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we live as politicians will have no difficulty.
On the other hand, we will do what we can to increase the investment from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect investment environments.
"But we'll do what we're supposed to do at this point, and we'll do what we can to keep our investors and the middle of the investment will not be affected."
TYDTA President Ermut told TYDTA that Turkey was beginning to look more interested than China after the only narrow road strategy, but if problems in Körfez are solved, the biggest investment will be expected from Körfez.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, 'We've been in trouble because of these relationships, and because of this incident, we've got investments, we've run away'," Ermut, who used their words, said that they were the companies that came and followed.
Ermut, "The German companies are now close to 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio."
So the companies we've seen around the world are almost 10 percent of German companies.
Some of these are companies that are still investing in Turkey.
A person's going to increase his investment or something, and we're making it clear as a project.
He said, "The German companies are actually creating an important part of our daily work flow."
Ermut, who pointed out that all government institutions should be careful in the periods during which the original operations were carried out in Turkey, said that the matter was sensitive and could be affected by the least bad communication.
Ermut, pointing out that those who lived in the past two or three weeks were a good class, said:
It's always different with investors.
We've always seen this; economic relations always provide a new way for political developments.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and our important investor.
Because there's still a lot of investments in Turkey.
My election day in Germany, unfortunately, increases this kind of statement.
I think they're going to get a little bit further along the way, too.
In Saudi Arabia, he is also concerned about making a negative statement in both countries.
A netizen investment investor in Turkey is making investment in all the countries around the world.
As a result, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of uncertainty in the region, there have been some slowing down.
But we're still dealing with these investors.
My own experience, the investors may be waiting for a decision they can make faster.
'In a negative sense, I see uncertainty about the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and I'm leaving here.'
On the other hand, we have Swedish investors who still live in Turkey, who meet us on one side while we're doing our holiday here, and we're following all the procedures.
Then Ermutt, remembering that international investment in Turkey last year is worth $12.3 billion (ULY) "I definitely think we're going to spend it this year.
"Just how far we go, these regional developments will affect global uncertainty."
As he hoped that the effect would be more than normal, Ermut suggested that it might be a little more restrictive, indicating that it was increased by 11 percent in the first five months of age, indicating that it could protect, "If there is no bad development, then I believe we'll probably close better by the end of this year than last year."
Ermut, logistics, health, fintech, knowledge, petro-chemicals, soil, energy and imaginatives, gave information that new investments could continue to be made in the important part of the investment.
Ermut, who points out that in the months to come, there will be new investments, "May be an investment analogous in the future."
It's not a billion dollars, but I'm a big investment.
"There may be investments from countries if you're interested."
4 wine company surgery for 9 years: 55 surveillance
The team of the Anti-Frauds Board of Governors of Istanbul has found that, after the sale of the products sold by the 4 wine companies, TAPDK bands have been collected and marketed for new wines.
The oil teams indicated that due to the repeated use of the suspect's banners, the state lost 20 million 400 billion lire taxes.
The police teams organized the same operation today between the four wine companies Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdåg, Bursa, Fisheries, Manisa, Moon, Marine and Nevšehir and the 55 addresses of the factory and their warehouses.
During the operation, a total of 55 people were monitored, with 15 000 available wines being sold, 52 000 480 again used to obtain TAPDK banners, 12 000 890 to TAPDK banners, 3 banks and mermaids, 100 boxes of sexual jokes, 992 to run out of puro, 698 kinds of fake drinks and 100 litres of anazone.
55 people who were taken into custody were brought to the Anti-Fraud Office for Refugees in Vatan Cadesi.
The suspects are carrying out security operations.
The operation of their teams to their factory, warehouses and crews was under surveillance of police cameras.
It's shown that police teams have made calls in a warehouse to check out the available wine wines on the market.
All the mail collected from the used bottles was recorded in the police's search for TAPDK banners.
How will football rules affect Neymar's going to Paris?
The rules governing the unbounded cost of European football clubs will not prevent the transfer of world record from Neymar, Spain from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
The team of Prestigil Champions from the League of League teams, which is capable of managing the European game from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Justice Game Rules issued by UEFA in 2011 means that Neymar’s transfer to the PSG will have to be shown that he has financed the transfer of Neymar without continuing losses.
In Barcelona, he paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy Brazilian Serbs out of the contract, and he won't earn ten million dollars a year in Neymar.
Some of the financial ways Neymar goes to France are:
The team can certainly pay the money to PSG Neymar when it is taken from the Katarzyl family in front of the money, and it can add it to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend the money they're charged to get players, but they also have to go back to their sources with a record of success in football.
The FFP was created by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that after his success, the clubs who were responsible for the big debts were performing a lot of satisfaction and that if banks or owners were to withdraw their support, they would be at risk of failure.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor the damages rather than the debt of the slaves.
The change meant that the model used by Roman Abramovic was first used in Chelsea in 2003 (a potential club, a high cost to improve the team and a global brand) became more difficult.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period leading up to 2018, the clubs can face 30 million euros.
Although Platini has been disfellowshipped from the presidency in 2015, he still decides on his rejection of Alexander Cefer's absence from UEFA.
Andrea Traverso, who led the FFP at UEFA last week to Associated Press, said: "The FFP has certainly not died, and we will certainly strengthen its rules."
As much as PSG Neymar is going to pay the purchase material as a whole, it can be distributed in the contract period due to specific reasons.
A five-year agreement was signed by Neymar, so the transfer fee can be shown as a €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
In 2014, the first wave saw the application of the FFPs, PSGs and Abu Dhabis, which had the most difficult designers in Manchester City.
PSG was sentenced to a fine of 60 million euros later to 20 million euros (for that time 82 million dollars) and the Champions League team for the 2014-2015 season was normally ordered to limit it to 21 players in 25 instead.
UEFA, in the absence of a case against the clubs that might try to deceive financial editors by means of companies connected with the owners of the club.
Although a parent company may be sponsored by PSG, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a fair future if it is thought to exceed the standard market values of sponsorship.
This was the case when UEFA ruled in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority had been exposed to PSG sponsorship.
A part of Neymar's PSG winner was announced that Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organization Committee would be able to pay.
But PSG and Qatar 2022, they lied that Neymar would be a world Cup Ambassador and that such a move could easily be taken out by UEFA editors.
The actions applied to PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful against attempts to break the rules.
According to those in charge on Saturday, UEFA is not in a pre-trial meeting with Neymar on the transfer of Neymar.
They talked to The Associated Press as they couldn't talk about the PSG situation.
The latest published estimates show that PSG spent more than EUR 542.4 million in 2015-16.
The accounts of the past financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's progress to ensure that it is in line with sponsorship agreements, presents and form sales.
The column is waiting to increase by at least 30 percent after the signature is signed.
One of the biggest football players in Spain, who was apparently uncomfortable with one of them, tried to stop Neymar from leaving with the idea that the PSG had accepted the FFP.
La Liga, head of the League, Javier Tebas, Spain's newspaper AS, pointed out that Qatar has a clear possession of PSG, "This is an open 'maldoping' with the club and the state."
Arsene Wenger, the director of Arsenal, who owns his club, shares his concern about the financing of a government by La Liga.
On Friday, Wenger said, "This has completely changed the entire land of football in the last 15 years."
"Everything is possible once you have a club in one country.
It is very difficult to respect financial Fair Play because for a country such a great player may have different methods or different areas of interest to represent a country.
The 'tavan price' flag with which the security guards are located
According to TSB data, the security sector has been damaging since 2006.
In 2015, only 19 million TLs were burned in 2016.
Borsa is operating in Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and South Sigorta in Istanbul.
At a first six-month meeting in 2017, the TSB said that 11 years of traffic security damage reached 7.3 billion TLs, and that this year it was 2.3 billion TLs, and it was expected that it would go out to 125 per cent of the affected-primary area.
This year, the children who said the number would be arrested in 2012 and 2015, taking into account that other branches of the damage suffered in 2012 and 2015, "This means that we also increase the cost of the crime police by financing the bad driver."
He said, "In fact, 75 percent of the sector's foreign and our partners in the country have financed the bad driver in a sense."
Guys, it's like this:
We don't have to wait for traffic, but we don't show that we've been driving in the past 11 years.
He said, "We accept this too, but we are disappointed that we can carry it with other police officers in a safe environment."
The children who said that they were dramatic price increases when other traffic injuries were also reported to be in the darkness, "The traffic security increased by about 30 percent in 2012, and almost doubled in 2015, and we wrote the greatest damage in our history."
"Our wife was only 19 million TL by the end of 2016," he said.
The Children who are waiting for the next year's free rate to pass, "We'll reduce the price of a good driver in the field of freedom and apply high prices to a bad driver."
He said, "But the treasure looks at the general departure, the last word on the horizon when it's going to happen."
The Property Museum, which has been established in 2015 in order to show that a large proportion of the population of high-speed traffic security has been affected by a large proportion of the number of traffic accidents that have occurred since the 12th of Nisan, has been applying the maximum (tavan price) rates.
Therefore, the mandatory traffic security policy group to be organised has been identified in some of the annual categories identified as mandatory traffic security groups with regard to each vehicle group, numbering and traffic density in view of the number of accidents statistics.
On the other hand, a high rate of damage to traffic safety required by Tammuz has been experienced by the high frequency of traffic accidents or by the application of the "risk Safety Waters" application for vehicle groups.
The traffic security in the water will be shared between primary and dangerous insurance companies related to the police.
These security guards will be identified by the Prime Minister of the Museum.
In the first 6 months of traffic, children reported that their primary production decreased by 11.5 per cent in the first year of 2017 by 4.9 million and 8.6 million in the first month of traffic, while the number of police reached nearly 30 per cent in the first month of 2017 when inflation was observed.
The kids who said this year's traffic would still take their lives in other branches, "This can't be hurt with the cost of this weekend.
How much more can this damage be carried by the sector?"
The kids who say that all companies in the sector will have 9 billion TL and only 2.3 billion TL traffic damage will end in three years, saying, "What's the good driver financing? Why does my thousands of people finance the bad driver in Turkey?"
He said, "At this point we're trying to tell Hasine what we're saying."
After these developments, the Houses asked a question about the fact that foreigners did not come to a point of weight reduction in the Turkish security sector, "They haven't come to that point yet."
They're waiting to invest more in Turkey because it's 1.3 in Turkey when there are six police officers in the Netherlands.
"It's a place where Turkey really needs to grow," he continued:
So they're not out of here.
But every year, the company gets a lot of credit, but it's using it to make it bigger.
According to TSB data, while the primary production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, 12 to 23.1 billion TL over the same period over the first half of the year.
The boys said that the sector had predicted that it would not be finished by 15 percent of its total press production.
Social assistance for thousands of chronically ill people

The program, in many ways, also places a priority on being first in the world.
One of the 10 companies I'm going to invest is still German.
The President of Turkey's Investment Support and Recognition Agent Arda Ermut pointed out that the German companies in Turkey were considered to be a Turkish company.
Ermut used the phrase "There's no investor in relations with Germany who says, 'We're running out of trouble'."
Ermut, "Nearly 10 percent of our projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have an investment in Turkey.
"The Germans are creating an important part of our daily work flow."
Ermut suggested that Abraaj Group also set a good example of participating in Netlog's logistics company.
Abraaj Group said, "We have made a total investment in Turkey of $1 billion," indicating economic growth in Turkey.
Sir, the Last Osman

A century's transfer has been made!
Barcelona explained that Neymar transferred 222 million euros to Paris Saint-Germain against the euro.
The transfer progress of the football team in recent times has been made in official form.

According to the club’s online release, Bonservis was awarded 222 million euros and the world’s most paid football team was signed by Neymar, who was 25 years old at the age of 30 at the end of June 2022.
Neymar, who spoke after the sign, was very happy to be dressed in French representation, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and stealthiest teams."
I'm going to this club because I'm going to join my teammates and get as many cups as we want." He used their expressions.
PSG will pay Neymar $45 million for each season.
So the assets of the star player will have a body over 400 million avrons for the French representative.
Seafarers' fishing time has expired
The company of Izmir Grand City was unable to provide an agreement on a time-frame between the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) and the US.
On 12 December, the union member came out.
One month's strike ended at 15.00 today's after work was done.
According to the signed collective agreement, 12 percent of the money will be spent on insurance.
In addition to the Glerv Vorgi's property, which was acquired after the registration of the International Ship Sicilia, which was renewed by the IZDENZ, he was paid more than 25 per cent of the time he received for staff in his status as a member of the ship.

We also had friends who worked on the military's payroll.
And We have made them righteous in their hires, and We have made them righteous.
Nostalji, "Strength of Islamic America" and "Older Detective"
So for the days of the '80s, for the '80s', for the '90s' (the times when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the MTV) and for themselves, for 2001, before the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with greater things, this version of the story was nostalgic for all.
As a cultural product, it's not always a coincidence that our time is being taken to Facebook.
But as a matter of fact, it's like it's broken.
"The First Day of the Camp" was an unexpected success, and this was not just because of an absurd appearance (in it was a story about the origins of a box that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
As the main competitor (the role of middle-aged actors in the play of amateur children), it made it impossible to re-capture the past part of the game.
Now, adults are playing "That's After Year" more sensitive, and 90s are more sensitive to the wrong follow-up monologue about the film, like "Salean El," which is now played by adults.
At one point, it combines an Apple Powerbook with some unique patents and "many other things since 1991".
Most of the main stories are the same.
Mr. Showalter is no longer a writer, but he has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his fortune yet.
There is also another crazy plan that is now under way by George H. W. Bush (a very well-swelled address by Michael Ian Black) that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) has.
They always call the best part of the series.
It's particularly nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who's always at the top six steps in Matt Dillon's "Bears", who looks like Andy, the most popular kid in the old school.
There may be times of madness in this series that can give rise to this series (e.g. "Seven Up!" series) until I reach what I think is a reasonable outcome: "Islamic Slavic American: Ninety Years Later" that enables my friend's people to go to see the remains of the "Islamic Sikh American" film in the final stage.
Meanwhile, it calls for a different type of nostalgic nostalgic in the Amazon: "The Americans"'s "resurrection of the Cold War", the film "The Bomb of War" and even "Glow against the East" iconography.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, a comedian directed by Rhys Thomas, appear to have been on TV: a 1980's Romanian police drama that was fought for the real, atheistic and Marksist-Leninist path.
Leaders play by Kurt Gregor and idealist Yosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelieu Ulici, whose dialogues are performed by the English twice Channing Tatum (both chief) and by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a very bright idea.
But this isn't much more than an idea.
There are some nice, visual comedys (Americans watch football while the police watch TV and watch TV)
It's also a famous musical framework, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Savigny; it's a good instrument for "who knows" game.
But Mr. Detective calls himself so much like a fake propaganda drama that (including Reagan's mask of a killer) he plays like it most of the way he does.
He doesn't know how to cross six long sections and he's not fast enough to come in.
When Gregor and Josef continued to visit the size of two fat men who ate hamburger like always hungry in a lobby, they could make a better exercise if they were to speed up the "Old Detective" for a longer time.
He could turn the message into a message to a communist spy, anything in the Western culture that's going to eat in secret.
The creative Romanians were not wrong: we do this to our own past and even to them.
Traditionals of the father of FETÖ
The British Government has seen our family as the result of five years of experience.
The high government has recognized that this family has been closely associated with the English Government since the past and has been in large services.
The wise and careful way in which the English Government handles this ransom is to investigate everything carefully and carefully.
While trying to understand FETÖ, the organization of the Seeds is taken as a starting point, but the forgotten hand is an organization that has emerged in the imperialist era of FETÖ and has moved with the forces of the Soviet Union.
These are the Canadians who have to take the first move.
In the English language of his entry, he is the founder of the charity Mirza Gulām Ahmet Kadiyanī, the founder of Kadianīlik.
Kadian, born in Kadian, a small town in the Indian state of Pencap, said: "In 1888, God commanded him to take action against himself and create a different group."
In 1891, when Ahmed’s slave had died with a death like that of other prophets, he said, “God has sent him as a Messiah and a blessed one.”
Thus, he is the same person with the message that Muslims expect, and this is Mirza Gulām Ahmed Kādianī.
(Islamic Anciclopedia, TDV)
After the 1857 Sipahi strike, in India, where the entire English seclusion is under way, the author of the books that protect against Hindus and Christians under violence, Gulām Ahmed, who was thought to be founded by a completely holy sect, but who later came out of the CIA's support to the Communist and Mocadele Ministry of Justice in Erzurum, who defended Islam against the intreviation of Islam.
Like Gulām Ahmed, the most popular opinion of imperialists like Gülen is that "cihad" is only a struggle with its own soul and that if you can live a free life of religion, it is not a struggle for imperialism.
And even if you remember one step further, the pain in our history has gone down in a year when we've even gone through the attacks of the Allies: "It's not very dangerous to work on your country.
For between you and them are chains of iron.
Once they don't touch your wife or your daughter.
They're not connected to your mother. They're not connected.
The idea that gratitude and Christianity are united within itself, the idea that their own community will be the Savior of Islam, the idea that the struggle would mean only self-restraint struggle, as soon as it comes to the subject of war, is still similar to the FETÖ, and the form of the spread of Catholicism is generally in the field of education and civil society.
The number of congregations in the world's collective centres, which say over 2 million of 'Thabies', is estimated to be 23 countries that are registered as a representative of the Humanity First.
In addition, 36 patients in 12 countries, 650 in 55 countries, only 8 levels for Canadians in Africa; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and some 16,000 trains worldwide.
In view of the "first Muslim scientist" who received the Nobel Prize, Professor Abdulselam, Sir Zaferullah Han of the United Nations General Court of Justice, and the "Ilk Oscar Actor" Mahershala Ali is also a Canadian, we can see more clearly the depth of the world's recognition of the Canadians.
Let's note that the meetings we had with 30,000 people last week in England were also broadcast as a show of their brains.
One of the slogans is a short enough look at their history in order to understand that "Every one is happy and does not hate anyone" is actually what the Canadians want to say, "Love your fans/smokers."
In fact, it is possible to convey the exit points and motivations of events such as FETÜ or Tahir-Qadri, and in fact, all of these organizations are in support of public expression in order to serve the Sumerians.
"Song wish" out of the cargo
Because of pancreas cancer, Emily Pomeraz (50), who spent the last days in a hospital in Washington, D.C., asked for a restaurant's coffee and chocolate-related milkshake.
A woman's friend met Tommy's restaurant owner.
Tommy Fello, who worked at the same restaurant for 47 years, placed a bottle of beer and paid a fee of $123 (435 TL) and sent to a hospital 600 km away with a "fast delivery" charge.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To this day, Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, who lived in important projects such as the Ahmet Kul Building, Dia Mare in Istanbul, Bodrum Yalykavak, sold seven projects on Solse.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project developed by the Mimarii Chamoğlu Mimari is developed to benefit the most from the sea.

He's got a lot of space types ranging from 2+1 to 5+1 in Mare.
In this year, the company that will take two new chances in Myanmar and Bitez is preparing to sign two major projects in Topcap in 2018.
He transferred 753 million to the shipping companies.
The Peacemaker said that many programs were conducted outside the TRT where 6 000,760 personnel were working and that they paid for flights.
The representative of the CHP, "TRT 2016, has again paid national taxes to AKP companies."
He said, "That's my name."
The source of TRT's transfer to the manufacturing companies was shared with the data obtained from official documents.
The CHP replied in front of the eyes how TRT's resources were spent in the context of the Information Management Act.
The partner, who worked as a cameraman of 6,000 760 people in the TRT, said that despite all sorts of technical opportunities, 753 million TL 500 000 were transferred to foreign-based companies in 2016.
The representative of the CHP used the expression "this is an arrow."
The Warfare, "AKP's journalists and companies don't usually use TRT."
He said, "Millions are paid for things that are not followed or that are not taken away."
The Creator, who remembers that the money transferred to companies has been collected from public taxes, "the institution of 7,000 people has returned to the AKP's estate."
"What programs did these companies sign up for? "and they took this money?" he said.
TRT stated that the advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL when the company, staff wages and other drivers were included in the account.
The partner, "AKP's TRT, which becomes a voice, doesn't even have a commercial because he's not being watched."
The media are getting money from the TRT, making it out for AKP.
He said, "But the people are taking his load."
The CHP's Creator said: "TRT people pay 660 million TL a year; but all work is done outside."
TRT, 753,5 trillion people from the nation's border have been interviewed.
It's a string.
The other woman went out and apologized to her husband.
The case took place at a car park in Sokak, the University of York City, at about noon.
According to the report, from the 4th side of the park, he told the residents of the surrounding area that he saw down the stairs and health teams.
When the relief teams were opening fire in the area where they were found personally, they were waiting for health teams.
A psychologist and police officer named after the incident asked for an apology in front of N.G., his 34-year-old father, Yununus G., who spent about 1 hour of his physical efforts following his death.
While Yunus G's on the other side of the border of the border, some 100 people were watching him sit on the streets, and some of the residents recorded his cell phones.
It's going to be nice to remind your friends and neighbors of your message!
What time is prayer?
The message of the summit continues to be investigated on the sending of guests and friends to people who will benefit from today's fashion.
On that day when the Lord’s Prayer will be conducted by the faithful ones who will carry out their worship, the candles will be filled or opened to creation.
Here's the details of the Friday's and Friday's prayer on this special day, which is of great importance to our religion.
Do not be afraid. There is no sin in God's mercy.
Great cumadas.
Muhammad is my Lord and my Lord's Messenger.
You won't be disappointed in what you've hoped for.
You can't turn it back from you.
O Deva, who is tender-hearted and obedient, and who prays for his wares, and prays for his war booty.
Don't turn our hearts away from you.
With the light of Allah upon us is the Peace of the apostle.
Prayer is love, prayer is hate, prayer is hope.
Good Hope, Good Hope Full of Love...
May your love be like a tree planted by Peyg.
My Lord! Bestow on this day upon those who call upon Thee and who are thankful.
Let your beauty shine, and let not your face or your heart be troubled.

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at %0.25
The Bank of England is expected to explain that there will not be any change in income after the slow economic growth and inflation is reduced.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth would continue "slow" along with family income.
The Bank's decision-makers (MPC) in the Paralysal Political Committee used between 6 and 2 months to maintain the rates of 0.25; thus, this month required a smaller increase in support of slow economic growth.
In the three-month inflation report, the Bank raised its expectations of growth in 2017 to 1.7, in 2018, and warned that inflation would continue to increase by still approaching 3% in the morning.
However, in the few years ahead, he pointed out that it was necessary to track Brexit's inflation, and he said that debt assets could be more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the sustainable economic improvement package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The Bank said it would end the Global Funding Plan for Flexible Banks in the coming months, but in the plan it expected more than $115 billion (total $15 billion).
The bank said a few minutes after the decision was taken: "The central idea of the MPC is to continue slowly in the middle of the process of putting in a clear space (GSYH), but the fact that the internal real comets continue to carry on their weight."
In the case of Faizlers, he pointed out that it might be necessary to reduce inflation in monetary policy and that the market would be "a lot higher" than expected.
The markets still predict that the first increase will be in the third quarter of the coming year and another in 2020.
But the bank points out what every increase will be "step step" and "limited".
According to estimates in May, this year's and future years' declines in the bank's estimates are compared to 1,9 and 1,7 %.
In 2018, the Bank was expected to have 1,8.
Sterlin lost his value for the dollar after the news and for the euro.
Pound is $1.31 U.S. and $1.4 is $1.11.
The change decision came after GSYH's second cycle of %0,3 months after the last increase in expected increases in the number of expected increases, which was assumed to be 0.2 months ahead, according to GSYH's second cycle.
The increase is probably going to be %0.3 in the third cycle but the bank will start to show a slight increase by the end of the year.
When the bank says it's going to get worse before it's fixed, the latest inflation report, later inflation and the next four pay increases leave little joy to its people.
The Bank said that the monetary policy would not "stop" in a few years before us, but that at the end of the three-year period, it was expected to correct "the normal size" at the end of the budget.
At the end of the short term, the increase in demand for British assets will help support the economy by reducing some of its cost of savings.
The decision will be made one year after the fall in August last year after the EU referendum of shock took place.
The Bank expects that this will take four years to affect prices and the economy as a whole.
Before the bank's final decision, there was a demand for an increase in inflation pressure on the remaining peoples and an increase in the number of three policy makers by an increase of 0.5 per cent.
Inflation went back to the last month from %2.9 to 2.6, but the bank said it was expected and it would increase again in the months to come.
According to their %2 targets, the bank said that it was about "unpowered" pounds.
Andreco Mortgage Brokers, director of Korea, Andrew Montlake, said: "When the last fall in the task area is taken into account, the debt-payers' work and the closure of the year will become more acceptable once more mortgage markets.
The market; in the new mortgages, it looks very good for those who reach the end of their existing agreements, and many free options and low rates are becoming more popular than ever."
NHS will write HIV anti-HIV drugs to 10,000 people
In the High Court, patients will be able to access HIV prevention therapy once a month after a fight against drug financing in NHS.
In England, NHS reported that the risk of infection in high-risk people was shown to be around 86 percent, and that a pre-emergency vaccine (PREP) profile would be provided by up to 10,000 health services, which were expected to last 3 years.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the investigation following the approval of the Temyiz Court. In its decision, NHS was said to have the power to pay for Prep against the ideas of the local authorities.
With this event on Friday, NHS England's president Simon Stevens identified it as a 'new and serious' national Aids Trust (NAT) as a 'done point'.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the population, with more participation in the clinical team in England until Nisan 2018.
A number of HIV medicines that reduces the risk of HIV infection prior to prenatal pregnancy (PREP).
Tests showed that HIV transmission has decreased significantly among those at risk of infection among PrEP.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough medicines to prevent the spread of HIV infection in the body.
These drugs can be taken every day or without sex within two hours.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinically qualified participants will identify men, women, transsexual units and partners who are exposed to HIV situations by anti-retroviral therapy.
Those who live in England and have a practice doctor's record will also be able to register for potential participation in local sexual health clinics.
The programme will hold $10 million and has signed an agreement to provide this week with an offer to the NHS countries of England.
The test was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to target, conduct, and apply large-scale evidence.
Mr. Stevens said: 'This new and serious victim of HIV infection will be found in the hands of a wide-ranging and successful gang.
This is one of mankind's most important health problems, which is another kilometer in my 30-year progress."
The head of NAT (National Aids Trust) Deborah Gold said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If the target is correct when necessary and when under risk, it is likely that the HIV virus in England will be changed.
In the past few months, people who are at high risk of HIV will reach a new and powerful way of life that is actually controlled by the NHS in England by the NHS, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We're dealing with this feeling in a warm way."
Terrence Higgins Trust, Ian Green, said: 'First you have to try to use it quickly in the country and make sure that someone who is at risk of HIV is not left behind.
As the preEP test drug is now provided, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who carry the HIV risk."
Shadow People's Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PREP trial, and it's been late for months and then the government's report is slow.
The evidence shows how much this drug can be a factor in the end of this life-changing infection as part of our view of HIV prevention.
See, one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important to protect people who are infected with HIV and to end the spread of HIV in the community as soon as possible in the country.

The 24-year-old Melis Salihoğlu was found dead at home.
The Saliholu drove them down.
A two-secret investigation of deaths was initiated by the police who had been following him and who had been assessed as a suspect by the police.
'DEPRECATED WATER'
The first Prime Minister of Turkey and Ticharet was born in Washington, D.C., in 1966, the daughter of Umit Makbule, who was born in Washington, D.C., entered the Le Meridian Hotel in Etiller, on 1 August.
In his 19th letter, an ambulance and police team called on the authorities to inform a powerful tourist hotel administration of the body of Chillingaroğlu who had been in the room and who had not received any information from him for a while.
The health team reported that Jillingroğlu, who had suffered from a severe earthquake in the 19th letter, had lost his life.
The mother of the police said, "There was a depressed situation in those days."
31 December he arrived from Ankara to Istanbul.
I've got a tumor from my other daughter.
He said, "It was about my tortoise and my tortoise was affected by our disease."
The funeral is expected to be held in Ankara by Jillingroğlu, who is placed in the Court of Justice.
It's under investigation whether one of them was shot by one of them or whether he was shot.
'CHANNA KIEDI' INDEX
The other suspect death in Istanbul was in Sarajevo.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) was found dead in the house of Melis Salihoğlu, who was studying at the University of Car.
According to the figures, the young girl went home to school near the point where her daughter didn't receive any information from her father, and she couldn't get it from her cell phone.
Dad met her dead body at home.
Her family, neighbors, and friends were moved by the progress she had made in Melis's home, which was so much loved by her family and friends.
Melis Salihoğlu's family and neighbors were sentenced to death.
After Melis's friend in the social media, he said, "The bright sun was shooting at us."
Under our feet, we were in a good place when we ran into that small plastic bag with our best friend Jack and sister Eysan.
He shared his message "What was needed to die now."
Life of luxury: The final cat and smart design numbers have turned this little Earls Courts neighborhood into a home.
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who was responsible for the investigation, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to the Earls Court in 2014.
It's evidence of a new design from Queen Anne on the first side of a street and from Joanne's not collecting bubbles.
"I used to live in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my old boyfriend before," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something like my price.
I was shown an apartment at Earl Court and there were the same high ceilings.
I loved her and I offered her a present that day."
After the first meeting, 1000 ft of coal was renewed from the beginning.
At first, there was only one room and a complex plan, and you had to get through the kitchen to get to her bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an asterisk to make the best use of the gift ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my turn."
To this end, noting Hill's central monument and design studio Duck & Shed took Erfan Azadi out of a 12-ft table and not just a building to create a place where Joanne will live at the same time.
Tavan wasn't high enough to add two areas above, so he was making an entity you can stand inside.
He had to think creatively in order to solve the Erfan problem.
"It's very complicated."
We had to set them free so that they would not have to listen to one another.
This was not just a simple platform to build, but at the same time, the bricks would be so smooth that they would be at the right height according to the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement also enabled Erfan to get two full-time rooms on each other by bringing many more dramas.
The old guy from Retrouvius for the roof looks like a light light window, looking at the wonderful area of life below.
The golden furniture, silver wheels, and the old type suggests the style of all the design of the Serge Mouille lighting.
The use of windows plays a role in adding space, field and light.
The short corridors that are located on both sides make it look longer.
Factory for the window navigation related applets.
The antrede-like units provide Joanne's entire catalytic team with a storage area for her strength and strength.
The beauty of the sitting room that created a more wonderful area can close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Open doors are not new.
If he's free here, there's a door that can be lifted up in garage mode.
Erfan explains the door of the heavily powered MDF, "We used a lot of engineering here."
"So when you lift the door, it's really easy."
With the intelligent use of the area and the storage area, Joanne won a 16-metre more bedroom and an improved seating plan.
"At the end of the day, what is going to happen to you to sell my seating area, or it's determined the value of your property."
"As an orphan, a nurse will come in and make an account at least of my sitting area."
They were able to use the quality material that gave the area a look of luxury as they increased the area.
Arfan says, "It's things you touched, so it'll help you build a emotional bond at home."
"In the house, you don't like the lines on the wall.
This is important, but your hearts are not filled with pride."
This is proof that a space with a well-designed metric path can turn into something very wonderful from a standard thing.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to separate.

Photos of weddings for common couples
The actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world's home in Ortrie, where there was a lack of a relationship that existed for about four years.
The two of them, they said, "It was the most special moment of our life."
Two years later, he made a separate decision.
The brothers are fighting for $500 million for the state empire
Two brothers, four years after the Italian family was born, fought for one of Victoria's greatest wealth empires, worth more than $500 million.
The director of the former Carlton Football Club and a young brother, Colin De Lutis, in Toorak, is living at three gates away from Paul, who gave himself to the High Court.
Paul wanted to leave his family from work since 2014, but he continued to have serious arguments at the Supreme Court about separation.
With Anna, their mother and brothers, Smith Sokakaka, owned 38 property worth more than half a billion dollars from a store they owned in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family built Westco Jeans and raised him in a prison with a shopping center at 160 feet.
In 1999, it was sold to $85 million.
This money was invested, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento real estate areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and shopping centers in the bathroom.
In a contract with their loyal fathers, Colin (as defined by De Lutis's family as "a common power and a dominant person") is owned by three companies, while Paul is owned by one third.
One court file says that Colin's $316 million, and Paul's got $176 million worth of property.
It's about sharing power and money for Paul.
In his first sentence in 2015 he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with the best of the kingdoms I've ever known."
The first High Court case was held after a vehicle that failed so many.
The brothers are also fighting about who will control the work; Paul says Colin left himself out of work.
Colin's defending that this is not true, but he's guilty of taking over some of Paul's property.
Colin says in a word of assurance at the outset, he hopes to resolve the disagreement.
"My Italian sources will tell me that my family is the most important priority."
Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are increasing with hundreds of pages of written assurances, e-mails and Allan Myers, best lawyers such as QC, and best legal practitioners on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her husband, Luigi, had been a family of Italians and musicians who had been married since the end of the 1950s and had bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin's family sold their property to buy the Collingwood property, which opened up the family's first box of pants.
Colin says, "But in my last years, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old)" there he built Westco.
Anna De Lutis himself and Luigi, who died in 2012, say he hoped to leave his property in a friendly way to his sons.
"Louigi often told me that he never wanted my brothers to go to court."
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colin says he quit his job and paid Mark $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark "were satisfied with the conditions of the financial differences."
According to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried to pay attention to being an old AFL club management member.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers spent Friday.
He just said "I can't say anything more" because Colin was in court with a short message.
He wrote: "It is very sad that my brother Paul preferred to accuse me and to bring our family's name to court."
In mid-2016 Colin wrote that he was trying to meet his brother's requirements in a court of law.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want to get into an agreement." And he added, "I still hope."
It looks like it's been lost on Friday.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump's new special word is planning to cut off another's media name.
He tried the others and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do this.
If that's the case, it'll be the first.
Politico indicates that his new White Saray special calendar will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) and his boss with the hope of keeping more quiet.
A few little information from Dr. Josh Dawsey:
"When White Saray's new special character, John F. Kelly, came in contact with prominent people on the first day, President Donald Trump proposed to solve a basic problem about white Saray: the lack of bad news.
Kelly told people, whether on paper or with briefings, that knowledge should be based on itself, because the president could make better decisions when the information was given.
Kelly's knowledge is very meaningful, but the others tried to adjust Trump by controlling the media.
President Trump's relationship with television goes on ten years ago, and he's still in the White Saray, and he's still in good condition.
One former campaign speaker, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Aday Trump, regrettably didn't take place in the media in a fair way, it would be a big boost to show him that there was a fair place in media institutions."
From Politico, Tara Palmeri wrote at the time "According to the six campaign mission, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that his personal media society's private media society's sense of dignity was preserved."
Okay.
But it's funny that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time.
Maybe he knows something that we don't know about, like Trump's tweets, it's gonna be even more shocking if they don't have their own agents.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If the elements could get him out of danger several times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one prevented Trump from creating a constant argument.
Some of the problem was that White Saray was one of those who fought one another, that is, those who tried to communicate their own stories to Trump with materials (which could be trusted or untrustworthy) and those who put their own worlds ahead of their own.
In May, throughout this story, he reported on the way the speakers reported their way of conveying information strategically.
One example of this was told by Dr. Shane Goldmacher:
"The existing and former Trump officials say that they have treated the poor who are under the pressure of Trump, especially those who have been severely affected by the disturbances and who have managed to find out where they are from.
At the end of the day, someone's chief Internet prosecutor, Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, gave Katie Walsh a printed copy of an article that accused him of being "a source behind a series of divisions" in White Saray.
It was not important that Johnson should have been law-enforced on Twitter for a certain reason or that he had no evidence or that he had committed an organized crime in the past and that he had returned from it.
He read the Trump article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmaker, who was then a private speaker, Reince Priebus and White Saray, added that Rob Porter "was trying to establish a system that managed and documented by Trump's acquisitions."
How did this work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll come out as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still struggling for his own support and his assistants are still fighting for the spirit.
These constant factors will make Kelly very difficult.
Krypto FETÖ" was the main template
Izmir Community Attorney General Verkant Karakaya has completed his questioning about the fact that the "Serious" code known as the "Serial Force Force Commander is the FETÖ of the National City Commissioner in the field of "Missionary Gender Survey" has begun to claim that he is the FETÖ."
In India, instead of being a member of the General Assembly, it was suggested that the crypto body of the Order should be encrypted and that it should play an active role in the fight against FETÜ.
In a decision that was signed on 15th of December, in accordance with the order of the Minister for Labour, the Commission decided that he was attempting to pass on the order of the Navy, and that he had given a fight against FETÖ since the first day of his entry into the camp.
In a follow-up decision by Karakaya, the following words were used: "The owner, the owner of the crypto remote service group, has agreed to work on the crew's team's team's team of personnel under the special template and 64 basic criteria, based on the system established under the 209 criteria."
In the case of a case of an open, private and confidential nature, it was decided that, in the end, there is no evidence of an active terrorist organization, such as the fact that a private and confidential group has been investigated and that it is not possible to be evaluated in the sense that it is not possible for us to assess the suspect of a terrorist organization, which is a major factor in this regard.
The Supreme Judge was convicted of his crimes before.
After that, it became clear that the FETÖs were still there and that the alleged crime was a compass.
The former Air Pilot Kurmay Colonel Hakan Dinch, who was in his complaint by the editor, turned his complaint into an information note form, an old Adana Ingredient 10.
Tanker Os Commander Air Pilot Lieutenant General Bekir Ercan Van, former President of the General Assembly, former President of the General Assembly who took office in the case of the inquiry, President of the former President General Mustafa Ossoy, former Chief Chief of Staff, former Chief of the Navy, authorized the attack, was charged with the removal of the former Chief of the Sea, former Chief of Justice Akif Us and former Chief of the High Commissioner of the Serdar Chamic, who had been found to be a witness to the Master of the River.
Some of the members of the group that was also found by the FETÖ Fair, Tuncay Opcín, came out to meet the Mayor with their social media shares before and after 15th of December.
The passengers have gone too far, they're back to 'rich places'
Some of the richest owners of the West Midlands are fighting again with the most powerful passengers who have been captured by the Council to recover their property.
The passengers parked their 20 standard caravans outside a region known as the 'rich House', which is far away from Solihull's time.
The Consein, they returned after they were fired in May, with horses, babies and a full truck.
A group of wise men found a hole in the defense and broke into a passage from a section that had been left unscathed.
The people were angry, saying it was 'no use in the solution of the problem'. Solihull's Council was short-lived.
A homeless resident said, "The people who passed through the street were sent out from Bentley Heath, and they came there on Friday night.
The Council should be ashamed of its actions because these are useless to solve the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were sent back, and now they're back.
It's more than last night, and it'll probably be more today."
He added: 'Birmingham knows how this will happen with the long distance decisions taken to protect the parks.
I, I live in Streetsbrook's street and I'm not happy to continue paying my tax when the council can't stop it."
A local priest who didn't want to give his name said: 'As a joke, we've seen that the last group of passengers is still separated, we've been banned by a new group.
The numbers were increasing this time, and a horse was burning in the park.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said: 'We realize you're an unauthorized camp between Streetsbrook Street, we're starting the legal proceedings to send them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that the police report any anti-social or criminal behaviour between a number of regions, where possible.
This will help us to get the court's status in the middle of the trial."

They blew up at their stations.
There were thousands of cars destroyed with the storm and the storm that we had been in Istanbul on Friday.
While most of the drivers reported from the airport to be contacted by the insurance companies, drivers who have not reported to date have also entered the hole for the report.
Drivers who are not in my notice today, who are in a state of chaos, have come to the station for a report on the last day of the notification.
Today's Last Day
The drivers drew pictures of their vehicles to the task force to detect the damages of their vehicles.
The vehicle's damaged drivers later reported to the task force.

Heavens that are walled by the sea do not breathe
The CHP MEclis Member Nadir Ataman, who was in the wake of a depressive warning about high-ranking structures in the yard, wrote: "The Danish knowledge report says that these structures will not be subjected to depression by 6 violence."
The healthy rock indicates that the rocks are less than 25 to 30 meters below this level.
Estanbul Atakóy left the high-walled hotels and residences between the sea and the Black Sea.
Mr Nadir Ataman, a member of the Chechnya University of Bachelorship of the CHP, responded to AVM, hotel and residence projects with a high level of attendance.
Father, who took note of the winding up of the buildings in Sahel, said, "Those who planned for the wind 80 years ago have created the Ataturk Orman for Florya.
Eightty years later, as a civil understanding point came to an end, the heavenly bodies changed and changed their language.
He said, "There's no breathing in the future."
The father, who said that the roof of the building was changing the roof of the building like a wall, continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees Fahrenheit [- 10 ° C] for those who are saved."
These buildings have to be constructed according to windmills.
But our skyscrapers are climbing over Istanbul's wind corridors.
He can't get into the windshield.
These arrangements are disrupting the natural environment of life.
The Father said that these heavenly creatures, who were harming the environment and the human health, would also destroy the link between the people of Bakrkoy and the sea, would follow the Law on the matter and go to court.
It's possible without surgery when you turn your hands around.

Because of these two non-operative ways of turning brain disease, patients can return to their social and work life in a shorter period of time.
Dr. Mert Atak stated that there were diseases, infections, seizures, and colds among the patient's symptoms that caused him to break his hair and body while living without movement.
In Italy, STKs strengthens their approach to rescue boats
Italy warned the STKs that the rescue operation in Akdenis would not be allowed to continue if they did not follow new rules affecting their operations.
In a report to La Stampa by Mrs. Marco Minniti, the Toronto newspaper said, "If the STKs don't follow the new line, it will be difficult to see how they continue to show their activity."
The warning of Minniti, the Italian authorities, came one day after the suspect that he had cooperated with human refugees in order to facilitate a ship operated by the German Aid Agency, Mr. Jugend Retett.
The aid facility, which was only a year active, refused to comment on the content of the specific allegations directed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In an explanation on social media, the organization said: "The saving of human life is our most important priority, and it will be ours, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the area of call and rescue."
"We can only make an assessment of the crimes to be committed now that we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been watching Jugend Rettet's boat from July.
The crew suspects that they have been transferred directly by human refugees to the ship and that they have allowed them to flee on board again with the boats of refugees.
According to the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place when Libya's owner opened 1.3 miles, according to the idea.
It is not under the authority of the Italian security authority who has been observing rescue operations in the region for a number of other reasons.
According to the letter, there was to be an Italian police memory that was clearly under the control of such ships as Yuvetta.
Only three of the nine STKs that took place in the search and rescue operations have agreed to follow the line so far: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain Pro-Activiva Open Arms.
On the last Saturday, he appreciated that new rules can be adopted without need but because he said there would be no "severe change or an angel" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is Nobel Prize-winning Doctors (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the small drop in the number of immigrants who came to Italy after their rescue last week showed that their efforts to strengthen Libya's moral security and their cooperation with local whales had borne fruit.
He said, "We started to see the light at the end of the tunnel in those days."
This month, Libyan whales have explained plans for a reduction in the number of immigrants leaving Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali to take the lead in meeting more about economic development initiatives.
Last minute's break!
Russia's president, Moscow, has been drinking a new vote every year as he has been celebrating "the day of the anti-parous alliances" in Moscow.
A Russian TV that was involved in the activity and that was too much alcohol, a Russian TV broadcast in the Gorki Park, attacked Nikita Ravozjayev's lawyer.
He warned the man who, once and for all, knew about the progress of the day in the living world, who once lied and said, "We'll rape Ukraine." He called him "Please stop."
The man who had been convicted of being an ex-conspirator had thrown a heavy spell on his client's notice.
He tried to get away from the man.
He watched millions of people live in the open.
Economic Coordinating Setup
The Economic Coordinating Body (ECK) was convened at the Chairman of the Chemistry, Vice-President responsible for the economy.
Following a change in government cabinet, the first ECC meeting held in the chairmanship of the Chemistry began at 18.30 p.m. in Çankaya Kushku.
At the meeting, Turkey's macroeconomic appearance will be taken.
At the meeting of the President of Switzerland, Malie Bajani Naci Egübal, Science, Science, Science and Technology Bajak was attended by Mr Faruk Personal, Labour and Social Security Bachelor Júlude Sarjeorek, Gümrik and Ticaret Bülent Tikaret Büllent Tüfung, President Lömfy Elvan, President of the Central Bank and related bureaucrats.
It can be saved in 45 minutes from the fall.
Dr. Ogz Karaemino, who is concerned about the need for only 5 percent of patients to be treated, says, "The patient's treatment is the first step towards rest and medical treatment," according to the patient's treatment.
The Ouguje Karaeminos are warned that intervention methods (such as epidural injections, radiofrequency techniques, discontinuation) should be used in the patient's patient group, "If all of these methods are not achieved, then they will become necessary" if they indicate that they are not successful.
Karaeminos, who are at least at risk in our day, explains that it is possible to survive in 45 minutes from the hospital's illness by reducing the risks of patients who fail to respond to the intervention procedures.
Although there are very good results from open surgery with microscopic surgery, after surgery a long period of improvement can be compared with some complications such as anxiety, memory loss and infection.
Microscopic urea is often identified as a 'capital surgery' but microscopic cerrachi is also used with the same approach as open cerrahi.
These risks arise because of the protection of around-the-clock docs in the fully-closed valve operation.
It's only 45 minutes from the operation that's completely shut down.
In the work of the Special Commission
In the Commission, CHP members will take their place in the House of Lords, High Schools, High Schools, United Nations Children's Fund and the High School of Discipline.
Commission of Berberogulu on 4 October 14th.
He will also follow the procedures of the Court of First Instance and the Court of First Instance with regard to the case in the District Court.
In his letter to the Secretary General of the CHP, Mr Okyyy, and the Assistant President, Mr. Bolent Quickan, in his mission to sign, "It is not lawful for you to take orders from any place without the law to be independent and impartial."
"Our country has not demanded any special status in the role of Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, but has sought to protect his belief in the independence and impartiality of his country," it was said.
The trial was conducted prior to the application of political orders rather than the court's judgment.
In writing, the Court of First Instance ruled that despite the wrongful decisions of the peoples of the Anayasa Court, it had been declared a clear evidence that the court had been given a decision to arrest without having been terminated, and that it had been decided under the influence of the Court.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for e-mailing Conrad Roy.
A woman from Massachusetts, her boyfriend, was sentenced to two years in prison for being forced to text and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now in her early 20 ’ s, will be sentenced to 15 months in prison and five years in prison.
On September 13, 2014, Carter was convicted of killing Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on his own.
Mr. Roy's father spoke on Thursday morning: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free to open up his career.
At least 20 years of imprisonment, he defended himself and Mr. Roy's mental illness.
Carter, who wore a red pants and cream-colored blue shirt, was wearing old eyes when he was being punished, his hands were beautiful and his eyes were on the ground.
The prosecutor said to the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life in order to improve himself.
He didn't accept his responsibility."
"He didn't show any regret."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation for him to regret everything."
What is more, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he didn't see "that he had any significant effect on the actions of age, disability, and even mental illness."
A prosecutor, Mr. Roy's mother, read a statement by Lynn Roy: "I don't have a day to swear for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to feel proud of me and how I am above all things, and I am trying to be with his sisters forever."
Mr. Roy's sister Camdyn Roy made the statement that the fact that he's never going to join his brother's wedding or that he's never going to get his kids.
He said, "It's always a pain in my life that you've been with me every day since I was born."
It looks like there's no Moscowese law guilty of telling a person to testify. It looks like it's gonna make the case worse.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he died of carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case was of national interest when Carter's brief messages suggested that he ended his own life.
And when she had prayed with her family, she said: "I do not know what you are doing."
He wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You'll be free and happy to open up the generator you need to do."
Judge Moniz told me that he wanted Carter to take care of Mr. Roy's death.
The case has passed legal proceedings.
There was Amanda Knox, who was found guilty of killing a friend of the British room in Italy two years before he was found guilty of killing Carter in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published a letter saying, "Michelle Carter deserves my understanding and help, not the prison."

SABAH's menace saved your leg
Beverger's disease, which has been around since the dawn of life, has been a disorder experienced by men, but in our day, women have become more and more frequently seen.
One of these women is 36-year-old Methap Dur.
The pain that began two years ago has been chronicled on the foot.
The young woman who was forced to walk went to the hospital to face the risk of losing her leg.
A friend suggested to Prof. Joseph Kalko.
The news "Azerbaijan Olaganist Haller saved his life" was posted in Sabah.
That's what Dursun, who went to Kalko, came into the middle of fighting Burger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took her young woman to an emergency operation.
Just a short time later, Dursun, who has been cured of his disease, now sees oxygen treatment.
Audi 850,000 Diabetes Switched Against Automotive Constructors
One day before Audi's hearing, he said BMW would try to increase software by more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's executive director, BMW's central (considered to be legal or restrictive) included Münni, said that the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than its investment restrictions" by hitting European cities.
On Saturday, the residents said that the three million Mercedes vehicle in Europe would change to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms were identified as calling back these charges.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help prevent carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are diagnosed with cancer, and it can be my stomach.
Automotive companies also increase the property of the equipment they need to wear in order to neutralize the damage caused by diesel vehicles and make it difficult for cars to stay affordable.
The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been charged with carrying out powerful car companies and monitoring the orders of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen in normal driving procedures in order to adjust their emissions during a time of self-testing, which conceals the use of a known device as a misleading device.
Many Volkswagen administrations were accused in the U.S. and others under both of the Atlantic.
Last month, Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany, the former chief of thermodynamics.
Former Director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is not protected from an Italian and is therefore not a criminal offence and can be tried in the United States of America.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was led to a German criminal investigation including Volkswagen; after the authorities charged Audi with a system to rescue him from European emission regulations, the United States expanded its central investigation.
The question of Audi may be difficult for Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer has a higher salary in Volkswagen's heart.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Turkish Norwegian Prime Minister Prof. Dr. Joseph Thank You Children, announced that no fishing would take place in less than two metres deep.
Every year thousands of people face the risk of falling intoundated water by falling and dying.
The size fractures occur at the most frequently 5 or 6 levels.
The characteristic of fractures at this level does not affect the nerves surrounding the arms and legs.
Prof. Dr. Chagwars, "The most valuable area of concern in these cases is cut off by a broken brain or depressed by a complex function."
He said, "The first aid to the victims of crime is the wrong one, but it does not help to increase the damage in the disasters, nor can it lead to death."
Fishing for water takes place in the fourth cycle when they are injured.
The average age of the wounded is 20-29 and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. Chagwar, "You shouldn't be fishing for water that's not in sight."
He said, "If you're a good guy, you're gonna have a serious injury."
Professor Dr. Choygar also reminded:
The damage caused by fishing may occur at different levels in arms and legs, depending on the degree of care in which it is likely to cause injury while fishing.
You may know my face, but it can only be a fraud.
There may be a hot spot that looks like you're in there.
In the United States and Australia, there was a 70 percent reduction in catchment of fresh water in lakes due to the alerts placed on the shores of the sea.
Professor Dr. Chagwar, "Despite the 28-year-old sea share in Turkey, there is no single warning table outside Istanbul."
He said: "The life-cycle map of these types of disasters must be provided in the fields of health management, schools and social awareness every year or information panels in the fields or in the waters under the social awareness project."
TURK Nörührerji Sührerzi Spinal and Peripheral Sinir Cerrahisi Group President Dr. Kadir Kotil suggested that these should be done in the event of an injury:
It's gotta be 112 for the first time in the case.
The size must be fixed, it must not be moved, it must be measured with a strong grip.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be put on the side of the patient's side for a runaway water drain.
You shouldn't be taken from your bones to wash the water.
Do not try to repair the damage to the patient's neck.
The bees may have been broken.
However, if pregnancy has not yet been diagnosed, it may result in an inappropriate position to be given during the first aid and patient's transfer, stressing and cutting of broken bones.
Under the threat of climate change, the Provence Valley
He turned into a symbol of Provence in South France, but there's a warning that he's under threat of climate change.
Lavanta, cancer-like insects, and disease-like bugs, and this situation causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution to the situation with a major headache.
The Provence Central Research Institute at CRIEPPAM said: "The impact of climate change, which has in recent years resulted in a much smaller and more recent change in the environment, has been at risk in Provence.
That's what's going on in the bathroom.
There's also a small angiosophageal bug that's got a microbacterium that's damaged, and it's much worse in very rough weather."
And a lot of things are dangerous.
The perfume and cosmetics that attract the fans are also following a silhouette of the lavata.
Eric Chaisse said: "We have smaller, less developed or never weak heads when there are several large plants with very long roots.
So we've got less basic wet pieces."
Among the solutions that have been taken, it involves facilitating the distribution of water and the removal of soil, but it also includes the development of more stable species of fish and water mix.
The journalist's murder is drawing under the threat of growing in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodace's staff usually meet to investigate the latest cargo, missing members and drug wars that have been removed by organized crime in the state of Sinaloa.
But today they have come together to talk about their security in the shadow of their own tragedies.
He told them that it was important for them to change their routines.
Two important journalists see what they feel more secure: whether to bring their children and themselves into the office of a hand bomb target in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard front of the room: the feeling, the inseparable, the pious.
They want to make a name for each column; there is no need for a proof, and sufficient are the angels and the men of understanding.
Drug addicts, politicians, business people, government or cartels are suspected of interfering with a list of people who are at risk to write the case of Mexico.
There are no paedos in the country, and there are more journalists than that: According to the Security Committee, President Enrique Pena Nieto died at least 25 people since his mission was launched in 2012; 589 were attacked and threatened by the federal security, and this year the mother died of at least seven children.
Among the last of the dead are writers and inspirational sources of works, the founder of Riodace, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez writes in one of his many books on drug violence: "Living and being a journalist in Mexico is the biggest mistake."
His absence is felt from the ground, but his presence everywhere, a large photo showing Valdez's middle-hand hand is taken at the head of Riodace's building with the word "Justice" at the head of the building; two 30's delegates, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing shirts showing his smile, a bright face, and a Panama hat.
She works two months before her death; she talks about partner traumas, kisses, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal case has been created in 2010, the Journalists have only attacked two of them according to the Security Committee.
Every year, thousands of deaths are committed by drug addicts, as is the case with organized crime.
In Riodace, although their hearts are broken, they insist on changing the violence in Sinaloa even though the earth is now more deceptive.
Ibarra says that it's very small to find security without knowing about the killers, without knowing about them.
"It's so stupid to spend my time on this job."
"You don't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
On May 15th, Valdez left the Riodace office in Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla could only last a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times in the name of the newspaper that was originally translated as the Tenth River.
The armed man ran away from his car and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown children were left.
What they said at Culiacan is on free movement.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
In the past year, Guzman was one of the most bloodiest war zones in the country when he was arrested and taken to the U.S. in October.
Let one or more people be shot and killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa or filled with more than two houses with bigger mosals for living.
For one minute, just forget to check the value of the folder gates and the drug Christy routes to the U.S.
Despite this, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Riodace's firm partner and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60), was released from the charge of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors are involved in murder.
The first was a report by the leader of one of the rival cartel groups fighting Guzman's sons in a February campaign with Damaso Lopez.
This letter may have made the boys angry; they probably bought every piece of paper from the press and sold it to newspapers.
The second mistake was that after the same story was handed over to another newspaper, Valdez was forced to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was an episode outside of Mexico and the country and was seen as a turning point in human violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been alive for a long time, and they've been expecting friends and colleagues to be there all the time.
He was an experienced worker in Noroeste in 2013 when Riodace was involved in selling 50 cents of money to his five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to make journalism without changing the issue of drugs," Bojorquez said.
In time, he won newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, and true news and increased advertising with sales.
Without fear of any danger, the delegates were eager to publish their own life-threatening research, and the readers were able to make a public reading of the stories that no one could dare to tell.
Riodace, eight years after his establishment, won the award for the prestigious Maria Moores Cabot for the news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the International Committee of the Journalists because he showed that he stopped following where the story of the Mexican drug user stood.
He admitted that he was scared.
During CPJ's awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In a report on Rompevinto TV, the drug escape in Sinaloa said "is a way of life."
"You must accept your responsibility as a journalist, or you will play this or stupid.
I don't want him to be asked what you were doing about death so much... why didn't you tell me what happened?
Riodace's personality misses Valdez, and he's teaching his friends who like to laugh at him, laugh at him, and give him advice about how to live...
They trusted his routine.
He always put his hat on.
El Guayabo was at the front desk and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routine fallen?
His death made it necessary for them to question their own destiny as to how they would best do what they would do and live.
"If you meet their wives and their children, and their clean works, and their secret jets, which they used to use as a means of transporting drugs, it does not matter to them."
Bojorquez said, "These things were too restrictive."
As a result, even in the best of times, he had a high degree of osteoporosis and did not protect himself.
Trusting their own wishes.
If bad dreams come, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, the author of Riodace's work, said, "It's an incredible feeling... and what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules are not valid in Sinaloa; just like Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and a vicious circle of refugees, weak institutions and street government officials who do not own houses in other countries...
The earth is changing continually.
No cell phone is allowed in the room where Riodace's staff met for security education; earlier, only censorship software sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers out there wanted to save their memory from the heat of 104 degrees (40 centimetres) in the shade of a tree.
Riodoce was appointed by the government to protect the office located in a four-bedroom building in a middle class of Culiacan.
Half a century ago, some of the delegates were surprised to see that these members said that they were not trusted because they were not with the police in 50.
It's been months since the authorities took control of the drug chains in the mountains.
This week, Riodace has three mother stories.
The former boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother, had a murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a light of government spending on the currency's government.
And there was a block from the prosecution that Culiacan had to get rid of a group in the most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was escaped or how it was, so when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew it, it was possible that the restaurant and the drug dealers were both under the supervision of the authorities.
A journalist, an official record, learned that the restaurant is registered under the name of a member of an official of the Organizational Translation Party (PRI) in my administration, who is in charge of almost every last century's policy.
In recent times many PRI officials have been accused of misconduct on a case-by-case basis.
Villareal, the lawyer, asked one of the sons of El Chapo Guzman to write about the events that had happened earlier in a military press.
Only months ago, they were reading about Valdez looking at the bottom of Valdez for the best source of information about escape.
"El Flaco," said Villareal (46), "we already knew what was going on before."
"All our channels of communication with our sources are now cut off."
Staff are re-used as a warehouse for posters and removals protesting Valdez's official murder to activists on behalf of the press.
The lawyer, Miriam Ramirez, got a couple of pankarts and went to the local prosecutor's office for another journalist's show tomorrow morning.
Salvador Adame died three days after Valdez was killed in the eastern country of Michigan.
He found a wrong body, and according to DNA tests, official officials say it's him.
At the country's press, journalists expressed their thoughts in a higher voice by writing "Help to the Press" to the media.
Today, Bjorkquez, far from Washington, Valdez, is trying to provide international support for justice.
On the morning of Valdez's death, Ramirez accused the press of having sex with the Sinaloa government on the morning of his murder and killing them for telling them the truth.
After that day, he asked for another assignment, thinking that his lawyer had betrayed his innocence.
Valdez continues to say that journalists in Mexico have been "turned away" by official officials, and by an uninterested crowd.
In his last book entitled "Narko-Parity" he wrote that journalists were being killed by the security forces involved in cooperation with politicians and organized crime.
The Media Watch Group, Article 19, has linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
Ramirez said, "You'll die in Mexico because they want to stop you."
The murders have clearly caused a cold shower effect.
No one's blog writer Maria Elizabeth Macias has forgotten her death in Tamaulipas' northern border country.
The body found it together with a note signed by the Zetas folder, "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and an earring with a broken head.
After the murder of the former Miroslava Breach in Chihuahua, the northern border state chose to close some publications like El Norte.
After their rulers were killed in 2004, others continue to act as El Mana did from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez, quoted the main head of the front page, as saying, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own countries, even from the country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find a job in prison, and they're still waiting for a dangerous road.
Sometimes, three months after they left Veracruz, they are taken along with four women in 2015 as photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was held in an apartment in Mexico City.
A day-to-day dance with these high-risk decisions for those who stay back and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to sing, says he's afraid of making a drug deal.
He said, "Mexico is going to hell, and I'm stuck with it."
A recent comet, half-night, while the final number was being completed, while Riodace's writing managers were sitting outside the office sitting on my desk and drinking beer, and they started playing their phones.
A series of armed conflicts involving security forces took place near Mazatlan, a place on the coast of one of the Tatilian continents, and resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to rage as promised in a series of folder messages.
I think they put the news on Riodace's website through cell phones.
The first page would be in a state of change the next day.
The sirens started walking around, and there's another weapon around here.
Bojorquez quickly checked to see if the police members of the bojorquez were being targeted.
If they were scared, they wouldn't even show up.
The only reporters in the newspaper were under the lead portrait, his middle finger was stretched to see all Sinaloa, and Riodace's frame was following his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the day Javier was killed, the stager wanted me to send him out to get me out of the street?"
He used kuffelage to escape his enemies.
It looks like a temple at first sight, but it's like a terrible dance.
Researchers have now explained that the very best way of protecting the original findings of an incredible creature from a Canadian forest is now to be found by scientists as ‘Mona Lisa’.
It was so well protected that they could understand that the money prize was red coffee and they could say it's a hard time.
The report in Current Biology identified this as 'one of the best protected and best dinosaur species in the world'.
Fossil is a new type of nodozore that was discovered 110 million years ago by the Cretase Dynaemi.
The storyboard was well-founded, and the researchers who identified it as 'real miracle' were surprised.
It's the best fossil ever found in its own type, according to reports in National Geographic.
Shawn Funk was found on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millionion Madeni near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
He hit something that looks weird on the wall, and he decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of land was used to extract the wild animal.
After such a long work, the result is now ready to be settled.
"If you cut your eyes a little bit, you can believe you're almost asleep."
'As one of the best and best protected dinosaurs in science history, the dinosaurs will become Mona Lisa.'
Researchers have found that this plant is facing a serious threat to the diet of the dinosaurs that it is likely to eat.
He used his red and white envelope to protect himself from very heavy dinosaur predators and used a protective technique known as anti-pollution, which has been used by many of our animals for many days.
The scientists say that the greater dinosaurs have been kidnapped by them, and they say that they have made it more likely to interfere with their environment and to defeat their enemies.
Our 110 million-year-old nodozore family was born in May for the first time and is currently held at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have already completed their work and have given over 7,000 hours of time to bring it out. The museum was named Mark Mitchell, one of the museum's most active groups.
The protection of the species has made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international humanities to document their appearance and body's cross-sections with money.
The animals have discovered that it is a way of protecting the world and that the upper part of your creation is more fragile than the lower part of your body.
Despite the spread of anti-emergency, it's amazing because Borealopetta's size is much more than the anti-mortem animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur has seen enough pressure from eating dinosaurs, and that my husband likes to face it as a way of life.
But the most popular animals using anti-smokers (e.g. clothes, zebras or armadillos) are much smaller and more obvious to be a horse, which means it has faced a serious difficulty in staying alive.
Brown said, "Devasa shows how dangerous dinosaurs in Kretase can be from a heavy-duty animal."
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in their money also revealed that they are the red coffee of the dinosaur.
To find out what you're eating at the last meal, scientists continue to pollinate the animal for those who've been on their way to life.
They believe that when dinosaurs die, they fall into a lake and are driven into the sea, and they hang on the surface of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today and probably more oceans and oceans were scattered into the interior than it is now.
Brown said, "Nodozor, it's totally money-contained and protected, but at the same time, it's really worth considering that the animal's original form has been protected in three ways."
'So, what the animal looks like in Kretase early today is exactly the same.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it. If you're a little short of your eyes, you can believe you're almost asleep."
Crete, it was the time when the giant dinosaurs who were standing on two feet traveled to York.
Although they were all kings, Tyranosaurus rex lived millions of years after the cruel dinosaur that might have been possessed by their wonderful fathers.
Among these are Acrocanthousus, who is a 6-toned animal at 38 ft (11.5m) length.
The latest findings believe that scientists who took place in Current Biology's history believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after her death and buried in the grave.
We were created on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when Suncor Millionion Madeni, near Fort McMurray in North Canada, was discovered on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, the best-deserved and best-founded red dinosaur is as expensive as this and its remains.
As an average of 18 ft (five meters) and 3,000 pounds (1300 kg) in a weight.
It's 20 inches long, 2 inches out of the mouth.
Researchers believe that it is now in the West Canadian area of the ocean that has been driven by this massive fire supply.
But the dinosaur's table under the sea was perfectly detailed.
The fossil remains of this particular type have been so well protected that parts of the body are still covering the entire surface of the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, at this point a debate "is not enough to win the piano.
The more I look at him, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized root parts still cover the entire root branches that are located at the point in the dinosor’s head.
The right leg hangs on its own, it's five fingers straight up.
I can pay the money on the foot."
Don't be out of your mouth when I say "I'm white."
If I have white teeth and an aesthetic smile, everyone's soul.
While people follow various ways to redefine their teeth, he cautions that oral laser applications should be kept away from products sold on the market or on the Internet.
"The whitening of teeth, with chemical substances applied by dentists or with porcelain surfaces attached to the surface as a stick to the surface of teeth," says Nukhet Berk, pointing out that these products sold can draw the surface of the mine so that it will no longer turn back."
Berk, who has recorded that many diseases are prevented by dental care and that the use of dental and dental applications is important for the health of teeth and teeth, and that it is important to provide the following information:
The teeth of young people are usually white as long as there are no defects or genetic factors in their teeth.
For years, teeth are more colored because of the frequency of aging, the drawing of teeth, and the use of cigarettes, pastry or toothpaste.
The whitening of the teeth can be done with chemical substances used by dentists or with porcelain surfaces that are applied to minimum or never conveyed on their teeth.
The teeth should never be whitewashed with products sold on the market or on the Internet.
Because these materials draw the mine face, and they paint teeth so I won't turn again.
As of 2011, the Department of Health provides the elderly, disabled and bedridden guests with "Home Dish and Oral Health Service".
In the wake of the 24-year-old Red Dungor, 65 years old, who was sentenced to bed in the wake of the night's wake, said, "This service has been informed by my wife's intelligence."
We've been looking for the Bebels. They're here in time.
He said, "I don't care about my teeth unless it's because of this service."
"My mother lives in bed for 7.5 years because of age."
When I came to Belgium, I saw the news of this service, and I called immediately.
We've been taking this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the words "very happy."
There is no need for health insurance for a service that is completely free of charge.
The "one" thing to do in the Turkish army
My dear students were particularly interested in the opening of the Marine Forces at the U.S. High Military Meeting last day.
It was brought, not to the command of the Force, but to the protection.
It's an application we've never seen before.
So how did this happen?
The Force Commander has completed his term of office in the Oramiral Büllent Boston, which would already be settled...
And it happened.
Now the command order came to the Veysel Kosele, which is the only airport.
In the past, Veysel Pasha, who had the power of the compass and had been arrested for a time, had to be the commander of the normal order.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you very clearly, if we start at the highest point in the Navy, the command numbers 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not cleared.
In this case, there was only one airspace in the Navy.
He had to bring the empty bag to him: the two-numbered Commander of the Coordinating Army.
So what happened next?
Colonel Adnan Ozbal, who was in the sixth grade, was shot by that mamaha government.
Now look at this table!
The Oramiral Veysel Kössel is there, but he's got a more routine command instead!
It's a big one. It's on your team's orders.
What's gonna happen after this?
There's no way to do it on the orders of a superhero who's got nothing to do with a corgeneral.
He doesn't get orders from him, he doesn't.
In this case, the VMS will not be involved in this activating situation, and if it is not loved by eve, it will be used today or tomorrow.
And this is a message from the government which has already been conveyed to him: Peace be to you!
After I wrote this letter yesterday, the news he used in his hours was published, but the situation hasn't been officially explained yet.
Now let's see what's going on!
The government has been opposed to this or that is why it has not wanted, forced its use, and replaced its command with a six-way curator and has challenged our army's future understanding of "Cadem".
There's a lot of politics in the business, and we don't know what's behind it.
Maybe we'll always learn together if someone's about to tell us!
My favorite lessons, I've been trying to tell you a very short story above, especially about the fact that it's important for the Turkish army.
It's not just routine.
For example, it's more important than completing the Harp School in 10th grade.
It's more important than it's to clean it out of the first order.
We've been living at the School Hall for some of the summaries of this incident.
The Garp Chief Command is empty...
He's got two hours on his list.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
We arrived in 1922, our troops will make a great effort to defeat the Greek army.
There are valuable names waiting for him to join the army.
One Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He's being offered military command, but he says, "I can't go to his command."
Another name is Jacob Ševki Pasha.
Ataturk's class at the Harp Academy...
He loved, appreciated, called "Hocam" a valuable and valuable commander who took place in various wars.
In 1919 he was arrested by the military and civilian Turks along with their lights and drove from England to Malta.
When he gets back there, he doesn't want to be a military commander, and he says the same thing, "The West Commandant is free from me, I don't take orders from him."
But Attürk thanks him very much and accepts the command of one of our two troops, Jacob Šivki Pasha.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A very spoken, regular soldier.
A command of war in Iraq, Kafkas, Iran, and all kinds of tanks.
He's also kidnapped by the British to Malta, and he's from there to Ankara.
When the military command is offered to himself, Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same thing: "I will not fight at the order of Ishmet, which is beyond me."
But he's convinced...
But let's see, after the mission has begun, the Garp Cefessian commander, who entered his command, has been constantly arguing with Ismet Pasha, he's taking the case out of the army...
And it's just a short time before the big deal, it's taken out of the job and it's loved to grow up, and instead it's brought to Nurettin Pass.
And then Ali Ihsan doesn't make any difference between the holiday with Fathertrick.
The issue is not only in war but also in unity.
Of course he has to go out.
This is the last example of the World Cup.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question "Who are the guys?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell disappeared.
A day after she came to New York City, she sat at the bed of the local Airbnb of St. Louis and started to visit Facebook on her phone.
It's like someone from high school shared it.
He said, "The police killed a child when he was 18 years old and he's still sleeping in the street."
She was surprised to discover that someone else didn't share this information when she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
@TheePharoah takama was re-tweeted in her inhalation as a user called takama.
The rapist from St. Louis was tweeted as Michael Brown's death alive, killed by an unarmed black man at 18 years of age by a white police officer at Ferguson Missouri.
There he shared a picture of Brown's serially lifeless body in the distance for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is crazy."
But death wasn't new to him or my people.
He left his phone on his way back to tweets about people's meeting in Canfield Drive the same night.
There were photos of a man who had a gunman who claimed to be the father of the police, and Brown's father, "The Ferguson police killed my gun-free son a little ago!"
A police officer watched a live crowd standing in front of a protestant with a dog lying in front of him.
In another video, another police officer said, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "This isn't crazy."
"It's not a kind of murder we're dealing with. It's not a typical murder."
That's what I felt like.
I was angry and crying."
He's got a return ticket, and he's gone home the next day.
He took his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go with him the next morning to Ferguson.
Ferrell and Ferguson will come to the movies three years after that on August 11th, a new documentary called "The Streets Who?".
This is a story that tells of people living in that community whose lives are filled with promises of survival and of protest, love and loss, power and life.
When Ferrell wore a flowering dress and drove his car back to Ferguson along with his daughter, they went back to talk about "the experiences of the politicians and the circumstances of the blacks" that they had done earlier that morning.
He said, "Do you remember what I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not true.
I couldn't afford it." Ferrell said later.
"Those who are here today... are the end of the past.
You need to know, see, and get into it.
Only in the area of activism and organisation should we not make good progress at the same time know what we need to do in order to free ourselves.
If I'm lucky for him, as long as I'm able to live up to an experience I can't personally experiment with, there won't be any difference between a black woman and a child.
I feel like I'm going to do something bad to him to protect him from these."
When they arrived at Ferguson, they were first in the South Florissant Road to a new camp for activists who were waiting to talk about the case of Darren Wilson, who was in front of the police center and who was waiting for him to be found guilty.
There Ferrell and her daughter contacted local workers who were preparing a packaged meal.
The bags were ready, and they helped get them to the protest.
It was slowly forming a new type of action for Ferrell.
While studying at Missouri State University, the Minority Students were the Head of the Federation of Hemispheres and the hunger for justice and health justice in the black community, he said, "My activity turned completely after August 9th."
"I had no experience in organizing you.
He has come from his own self."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film managers at the show one night.
The Follyan said that he wanted to know the point of Lucas Alvarado-Farar.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to prove it or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This doubt was usually indicated by a person in a state of countless whites; to come to a group and make sure that his pain and life were out of him...
As Folayan explained in a nearby report, "We have heard that the voices of the people born in Ferguson do not match, and we have decided to do differently."
The filmman has already contacted Damon Davis, the co-director of the area known for acting in connection with the death penalty.
His participation attracted Ferrell to the project, and he watched it in the following years after Brown's attack by the "Socks Who" team.
David said: "It is not the truth that a man can speak to us or speak to us; we are the ones who speak."
"This is what matters to me, how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented."
Folaan, "Even if it isn't to focus on Ferrell's experiences, he showed that his action was "not about a leader, not about the coming of my community," he said, as he said.
As a result, "Who's Soccer?," she's pointing out the personal ways of Ferrell's life, such as his love and his marriage to his wife.
Ferrell, smiling at his first meeting, said, "I felt like a ghost."
"I just realized that there could be a lot of empathy when I did this and when I was raising black people."
Besides, Ferrell's story, black women's role in the Black Lives Matter movement is improving and refocusing.
In 2012, after the death of Black Young Trayvon Martin, #BlackLivesMatter, they identify themselves as homosexuals from three social media sources.
"Ferrell," said Ferrell, "and this is because we are constantly fighting in many fields.
Black women have to carry all their weight."
And it was said, "The movement is indeed followed by black women and many black women."
Besides, Ferrell insists on "when there's nothing in a random type of action" and his identity is not selected by reason of it.
He says, "He was the one who spent this energy."
"It's not a coincidence that he's in front of the streets, because as a black woman, you're going to lose a lot of life in these cuts.
You can feel his energy from the screen."
At the same time, news cameras in Ferguson have already gone, but there are disturbing social connections between the police.
I've been watching Ferrell for more than two and a half years.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area I call my home is known as "karmasha".
Still, Ferguson's going to the streets is holding the song that he wrote to his memory three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our prisoners."
Kyrie Irving: The world isn't beautiful!
Irving, speaking to NBC Sports, "The world isn't boring."
It's the world.
They treat people with such fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the world all right?
Or is he turning around in a sloppy way?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our face.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "I believed I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was a mess and gone.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they sent back.
He's not coming back!
The information they've given us is very unsatisfied.
It's real here.
You just need to call for this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is right, is fighting with 24.4. and 5.9 assistants in the form of Cleveland Cavaliers.
A remarkable Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room in New York Friedman Gallery there are a number of faces with white, black and brown on top of the cables on the table, almost all of them look alike to one another.
This 30-port artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg was created by Chelsea Manning's earpieces and cut hair.
After undermining diplomatic messages about him with the WikiLeaks website, former historian Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison, sent his hair cut off from the Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new surgeon, which was opened in August 2, is a parallel.
This is an example of a three-day trial between a trans-wife who was convicted by Barack Obama and a former president of Manning, who was sentenced to three days in prison for his work with Dewey-Hagborg, which is linked to computer science and art science.
Deway-Hagborg, who created 30 ports using DNA algorithmic analysis from Manning, and using this gene data, not only makes it possible to process DNA data (there are many ways to process it and determinations come from it) but also has its own identity at the same time, perhaps in a slightly brain way.
Bradley Edward, who was born as a woman but who was more likely to be known as a woman, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 for being a computer liar and a thief.
The picture was taken from the prison under pressure, so there was only one photo: it was a dark, dark piece of paper that Manning, who was sitting on the driver's seat, was apparently wearing.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg succeeded in the project in 2012 with the long-term success of the More Garip Frontiers.
In this, the artist has produced a long DNA portrait of what these people can look like and what they can see.
He got an e-mail from Paper Magazine right now.
"They were reporting with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison and asked for a kind of portrait that could co-exist on this letter," Deway-Hagborg explained, in front of the press.
There was no visit during this period, no photo taken, so they arrived at Chelsea and asked if they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his prisoner, within two years, became friends of the unexpected writer and friend of the letter.
Even Shoili Kanungo, who was illustrated by the other Chelsea's punishment and his personal experience, drew up a well-founded Printed Picture book, which he imagined would come as a person.
Obama's quest for Manning's degree after the book actually went to the market a few days later was a happy news event in a military prison in Kansas after seven years without pain.
While Donald Trump has new, far-reaching and powerful ways to hide his own short-term divides that he wants to make war on the government and on the trans-sexual forces, there is something that can be tweeted about, and there's something that's now open about this story.
When all of this was asked about a strange time, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events are happening for some reason."
A artist who wrote on the wall of the cave, who received Manning's large-scale signature under it (which was put in the heart of the "i" character in the region), called for the final "automatic details" of the sex, race, sex and culture.
He's got a mitochondrial DNA sequence on the wall: many C's, G'lers and A's written by the arrow...
He wanted to tell us how amazing we are as we are all, including 200 letters (or nuclear nucleic acids according to the sociophysics of the artist) as we are all, at least biological creation.
"What I hope people can get out of this is not how obvious and objective is the fact that we are our genes and the genetic data are going to be lost." Dewey-Hagborg, who was in charge of the 2007 video work on Tallit Memorial.
"The DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
A page from the short line that passed the word in the last piece of space in a single room.
This is where Manning, King Kong fashion, U.S.A., is shown when he comes out of the U.S. Discipline Center.
"They've stopped your conversation, they're winning."
"Don't give up on her request."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"I'm still talking about it while my lungs are growing."
Manning hasn't seen history as a person yet, but when he sees it (as if it's a very prelude to the book of karikature) he sees it, he will welcome the masks of his own genetics gathered in the middle of the room as a group of protestors.
As is the case in history, it was done especially by Manning's 5"2" "Manning's."
Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits, "I put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be taken as a collective action with Chelsea, which was like a movement behind his liberation."
The Northwestern Education Mission and Oxford University are being interviewed by the Ministry of Crime.
The police said that after a man's death was found in a luxury apartment in Chicago, a suspect was found at the NorthWestern University of Education and the Oxford University began flying abroad for his work.
Cook's government records; on Tuesday, Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau was arrested for the first time without security against the murder of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56).
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died many times after he was shot.
In a warning published by the Chicago Police Department on 27 December, he said there was a body.
Members got a phone, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found his victim in the body with a lot of brains.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead on the scene, and the police were investigating the kidnapping of detectives as a murder.
Lathem has been active in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, a senior assistant to the university, said that Lathem's office was authorized and that he was allowed to enter colleges in the Northwestern University.
Cubbage said, "This is a crime scene under investigation by the necessary authorities and the Northwestern University. "
Warren is an asset assistant to Oxford University.
When a spokesman from the University and Somerville University sent an e-mail to her, she said, "We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way they need."
She also said that Warren's workmates were shocked and wanted to be obedient.
Mr. Anthony Guglielmi from the Chicago Police Department said he strongly complained about the authorities' submission to the suspects.
Guglielmi said, "The police have an idea where they're at, but our efforts are underway."
Guglielmi said she was helping to find suspects from local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said from the Grand Plaza building manager who had received a secret message that something was coming up in another 1008 area.
The police identified the case as a very dangerous place.
Guglielmi said she didn't know if she was on 27 December.
Lathem and Warren said they were in the security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that my teacher has a connection with Latham."
A statement on the administration of the capital of Grand Plaza stated: "The police are still working on the time schedule and history of the victim and are investigating a number of concerns about whether a family might be involved."
Italy, put his hand on the German ship
The Italian police explained that they held their hand in the House of Lampedusa, a ship called Yuventa, which was located in the search and rescue operations in your Central Akden.
The police who shared the records of the phone talks that were important to the two members also reported that this operation was carried out during the polls launched in October 2016 under the Trapani Debt.
"They've also been active on the illegal move in Libya-Italia," says Jugend Retett's members, at least three times, have brought refugees to Italy who have been taken from the boats of Libyan human beings.
The prosecution of Jugend Retett's wanted members, including those who worked with some people from Libya's Sahel Security.
In its explanation of this, it was stated that the people of the past would continue to save human life and that they would appreciate what they were being accused of.
The Italian Sahel Security and the European Union (EU) mission is also responsible for the chain of ships, and the civilian community of about 9 countries is also responsible for the call for refugees in Akdeniz.
The Italian government has prepared a 13-State code of conduct document to comply with these institutions and has called for it to be signed.
Last minute: Bally's 5 bombs were fired by the attack on the Great Britain.
After an attack by the President of the City of Great Britain, he was released by the police under police surveillance by the five bombs of the former police officer Mahfuz Banny, who had been arrested by the TCDD.
According to the news, a number of police and Céveik's forces have collaborated with the Belatie teams.
Russian Vice-President Mutko: "We'll finish the WADA road map in the short run"
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that the application of the remaining World Anti-Doping (WADA) criteria would not take long to re-work the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) as a last resort.
"In the implementation of the road map criteria, a certain environment has been completed, with the cooperation of RUSADA, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping) and the right to plan and test.
The WADA road map has been updated in this connection," Mutko said on Friday.
The president, recently published on the organization's website, appreciated the second part of the WADA Road Map, which described the criteria for reworking the RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this doesn't include anything that will bother Russia.
"Everything is heard, everything will be applied.
The outcome will be served to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
What is there is a criterion in the list; Russia's anti-doping authorities, who have been approved by WADA, and Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, are reporting on the consequences of the state-supported doping that has been reported in the Russian sports.
Mutko said, "When our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we're also conducting a questionnaire.
It's all applied.
But there's no government program, and we won't accept anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were repeated by Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
The Russian public body Smirnov, who spoke to RSport at early hours of the day, accepted the past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains the position and adjustments.
No one thinks it's necessary to accept the report." Smirnov added.
RUSADA was commissioned by WADA to conduct doping checks within Russia in the morning of the doping scandal in March 2005.
What is more, international scientists and U.S. Anti-Doping (UKAD) were allowed to plan and coordinate this test under the supervision of the United Kingdom.
In the meantime, after a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli Rusada said "progressed in the right direction" to resume work.
He's seen 100 million people!
In a short time, the video "Come to Share" that was heard by the Department's transfer of Negredo reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
Videos related to the dialogues between Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo were also shared with important newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
Galactary President won't be empty
Galatasarian former President Faruk Suren, Mircea Lucescu, has made Dursun Özbek a hard language to convince Bukreš and the transfer of India to Ankara.
Here are some of the special statements made by another person for the SABAH reading:
Lucescu-Ozbek's meeting, "We ended up when we left."
Galatarians won't go empty, nor will their hands return empty.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasairi is not going to football.
The footballer's coming to the President's feet.
Of course, if they know him, he'll kiss his hand.
But whoever's playing, the boss won't go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player that Osmanlispor took to $300,000...
It's not 7.5 million. It's gonna be 9 million bonus!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're gonna play and 7.5 will be 9.
I don't want to touch you.
But it's in the middle.
G.Saray's going back to heroin.
It's not just football. It's all wrong.
And he who will change it is the Divine One and the General One.
But as I understand it, the members are happy!
Start-ups to help your company avoid one of Uber's next
Amy Errett wanted to measure his happiness at the start-up, but the polls couldn't work.
The answers were usually unknown, unhelpful, or even worse.
If it were anonymity, some foreign workers wouldn't have been confident for a while.
In San Francisco, Errett, managing a 75-person e-commerce company in Madison Reed, says "It was never a habit or objectivity."
And he called out for help.
A new kind of human resources are coming up to make sure that they understand how those who work for companies feel.
These are; they produce a software to measure the activities of specific purpose workers, which allows companies to make extensive selection surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymous and complaint aid lines to workers, and in some cases allow managers to report weaknesses to the direct management establishment.
The company's founder, Jim Barnett, who measured the activity of software analysis tools by companies, said to Redwood City start-up, "There are now tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company Fitbit?"
Erreftt tells Glint what his employees thought and felt better after three years.
The specific groups are represented by a hot map showing which parts of the company are most concerned about and which management is less interested; thus, they can be saved.
They start to understand that companies need to have information about the culture of their employees to be next Uber; Uber has been in a scandal since they clearly described the media that has been condemned in a blog published by an ex-worker.
For start-ups like Glint, this watch is a very difficult job opportunity.
The financial technology content can be at $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
The attention and activity of the company to Denver Colorado, a central start-up Converter, which helps identify the wrong behaviors of companies, has increased between Uber's inconsistencies this year.
There's a client close to around 600 in Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber was soon registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Conversion allows companies to make their own personalized "best" losses, to collect real-time secrets, and to draw out the hot maps of problem areas.
It also refers to an anonymity line that allows workers to report wrong behaviours.
If the chief is charged, the complaints are coming directly to the administration.
Coversent's founder and vice-president Patrick Quinlan said, "The camouflage editors have been arrested."
Quinlan said: If a company, or a company, treats its employees badly or does not act ethically, editors may even deal with the consequences of fraud, fraud or cases.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant prisoner who has worked more than 25,000 in 500 locations, uses over a year to provide access to the company centre with information about the first and most procedures.
When he wanted to report a previous problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail at the company's center, he was in a formal complaint and expected to be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief lawyer, James Vitrano, said that most of these were disturbing and disturbing experiments, and that it was not a good way to follow up on the charges.
But problems with the use of the company Convercent can now be identified and solved more quickly by officials (such as individuals, tax or unfair pay applications) who have previously been in office, city or state-of-the-art positions.
Vitrano, who managed the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday, said: "I can get closer to this whole experiment, with a 360-degree look."
"In addition, we're protecting our consciences against business cases."
In 2002 the accounting firm Arthur Andersen took matters into account more seriously in 2002 after the collapse of the ethical values from the Enron scandal, which resulted in companies acting, value and employee relations, says Quinlan.
But after "social media came to them" they realized that companies could not prevent their inputs from being viral.
"Before technology was used to control the brain, people used it as a strategy of hope."
Both Glint and the Converter software are presented as a service and are receiving reimbursed fees for the use of their products.
This is a work model and an opportunity for investors to support both start-up ventures.
Converter; Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital received $10 million in cash from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and out of the total amount of $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in June and spent $60 million on total funding.
These investments are not surprising when attention is paid to the nature, culture and risk factors of companies.
Artan's studies in the mass show that those who work today expect more than they used to do.
High wages and interesting projects such as Silicon Vadici are just minimal needs.
The workers want to feel that they are accepted, appreciated, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
LinkedIn's global benefits and experience with Glint, Vice-President Nina McQueen said: "When people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they are hearing their voices and they are satisfied with what they've done, so they're more likely to be successful."
Investors earn profits when their own portfolio companies do good work; companies, employees, and companies feel good when they do.
It's not surprising if the third party's analysis tools encourage people to increase their content and sense of identity, and they're not surprised to find support.
It's important that we have data about our work, according to cultural experts.
But the data doesn't work if the company's agents don't move.
In fact, a company can create a waiter if I want to inform its employees that my change is coming.
And if the waiter doesn't come fast enough or never comes, he can get depressed and feel like he's gone.
Russell Raath, who saw the transaction management firm, who had a negotiating manager at Kotter International and who had made a lot of confidence in the company's data collection, said, "If you want 4,000 fronts, you must be ready to speak 4,000."
'Cause if you don't follow them, they'll think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And why should I care if you don't care?"
According to Errett, when a problem was reported at Glint on the same day, Madison Reed, who did the monthly polls.
And after I collected back from workers who had been speeded up by the decision-making mechanism and the quality of communication, various teams in the company were able to reorganise and add communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new information about its employees and long-term hope that this will turn into more jobs in this kind of industry, knowing that it's going to be a high number of employees.
Vitrona said, "If you don't have to create a secret culture, you'll lose people."
And if you lose people, you will lose your customers.
And when you lose your clients, you lose your company."
The removal of NCAA's two trainings every day means a long day for Bruns.
It's 11 o'clock at night and they're dressed to speak on a new trainer's side of a team of football players from the UCLA.
Some of these forms are wrapped on top of the surface, and they're in the middle of the early hours of the first day's work in the field of education.
These empty minutes for an important part of the team are creating a mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, he will return to his registered players' homes and work on his final tests before he returns to the Waterman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30 a.m.
Bruins said before he returned to the market, Jim Mora said, "The next three days, it's a pain for these people."
On the day of NCAA, which was set up to remove the burden on players, it actually extended its days to at least one Friday until the end of the day.
So UCLA's first three training courses were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to bring players into line with the heavy program.
The fact that there are no two trainings a day is more than one trainer a day; Bruins is getting closer one week after the start of the camp, and he's taking the first time training during the sixth season of Mora's school in Westwood.
In September, Texas A&M plans to train 18 trainers until August 20 before starting their formal game preparations for the openings against the A&M.
Mora said that while new words were added to the player's work programme, NCAA supported the legal change.
Mora said: "We will surely bring upon them a burden for three or four days. This is very difficult."
And they've been through this lately; they're working, beautiful kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to the comer market, and it'll be really great."
The UCLA will stop its trainers at the end of the camp; it's not easy to think of the luxury hotel Luckin Center, which is located on the edge of the parking lot and which is in the back of the building and which is behind it.
Bruins' players are planning to get married this week at the hotel, but Mora admits that during the season these rooms may be a problem.
Mora said, "We'll be happy."
"It's not very easy to think that you're going to rent a room and sit there and take a training to video.
If there's a video recording of a training, it's still a good thing.
But we'll be safe there and we'll be safe in 8 park area above.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Increases the power of storytelling for Facebook fake messages
Facebook's third party will send out more potential fake articles to confirm the story to confirmers and show their findings under the original share; the world's largest translator social network tried to fight with what was called a fake news day.
In an explanation made on the company's website, she said that she would use updated machine learning to test the facts and send them to the reporters, and that this would potentially show the results of her story verification under the original article.
Facebook is supposed to be one of the main points of the news that many people know as false news that they think the US presidential election 2016 has affected.
In May, before the French electorate's election, the issue of false news was raised and Germany became a major political head in Europe in support of its decision-making plan on the rapid elimination of its hate-based social media networks before the elections in May.
On Friday, Facebook, Germany, said that a new history-based verification test would begin in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, Facebook news media manager Sara Su said: "The third party wants more resources for what people read and share in order to see which stories they have shared from the third party to confirm the story."
He added that Facebook will continue to test its "indicative article" feature and will work on other changes in the media to reduce misinformation.
Creating a line of novels: The story of a Kale in England
In the past, little Scotney Castle took place in a Squeeze music club and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, a line inspired by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man who was a hairdresser and a historian, witnessed a 700-year-old story from a quiet sitting in Kent's Bewl Lake.
"I find it very nice to look at the manuscript of a man who died 300 years ago."
"How personal is holding this letter in my hand?"
A Kale from the Edward River to the Middle East in England is a different artist from Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book to support Rhodes' archives: He also wrote the Dead People's Dreams and Other Stories in 2014, a project that was inspired by the stories in the British Library, which he had not expected.
"My eyes were filled with tears from a letter written in 1700 by a second agent working for the King James's side."
"This was his face!
And the letters are always laughing because you picked up a fire for the light.
For someone who's been here 300 years, this smell feels like he's a bear.
Oh, I love the archives."
As an old paper lover, it seems good to receive support from the National Trust and the British Health Council and be able to spend almost four months on a calendar ( "If I have to be honest, I've got a little too much heat.")
He spent his days in turning to Victoria, discovering his "new" rock, researching archives, and working many of the treasures and antiques that have been built on the walls of his property, as well as on people who have lived centuries ago.
He talked to the poets, the speakers, and sometimes the artists who worked on illustrations of the book, talking about the land and the remains of the old calendar.
And then the evenings were "drinking and writing."
National Trust is completely available, but the last heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006 is not known according to Scottney's detailed history.
And when Rhodes came ten years later, he started taking the personal archive, which he also describes: "The hundreds of years of aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it between the ceilings."
The journals, letters from the days of the British Empire, and maps indicating the boundaries of who you are: "You think the land disputes will be difficult." Rhodes says, "but there was a small tree that fought over the two families.
Let me go, people!"
The Laborer, who left the newly built street on the participation of the Civil Isia in 1381, uses some of the stories in the collection as a starting point for making the street more extensive access to English history.
"There's a record of Kent and Sussex appearing on the map in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The great Isia started in this circle, and I thought it might be a good starting point.
Maybe these two can be connected?"
Other stories are often related to the history of the calendar, such as the story of Darrell's family who kept a 7-year-old widow during the English Peace.
Or 18th-century runner Arthur Darrell, who was thought to have filled his own grave with stones, took the place of The Smuggler.
Darrells said to Rhodes' most obvious Scottney family: "These guys looked like they were in trouble, they were always in debt and they were spending money for things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have resolved their debt crises by marrying wealthy women, and I imagine them as a group of people who are worthy of marriage to women's heirs."
Rhodes is in the process of writing other texts.
In Finn's life, in the early 20th century, he completed a two-week work on a line for a novel about Elevenmäki, which was once again adopted by nature.
But Scotney's got a different place in his mind.
He says, "I'm sorry I broke up."
"Sanki: "Oh, now I have to face the real life that's going to happen and be cursed."
Meral Akshener's attitude to 'Maho'
The National Movement Party has made a written statement on the concept of social media and the use of MHP in recent days.
By using the expression "he's gone to MHP" from the mainstream, social media, and "some ancient drummers" to MHP, he went on to "play and events to prevent him from operating under the MHP box after 12 September. "
Grandfather said to them:
"Turkey's history is so weak that it doesn't remind you of the history of the Turkish people, it doesn't appeal to the Turkish people."
"And now they've gone out "The MHP Kocaeli has used 410 members and 215 members of the MHP Bursa National Park."
250 users, such as 300 users, are being misdirected by unsubstantiated messages.
He's been lying in his paper columns, he's been lying.
This number doesn't mean that the number of patients in the places that we've been talking about is not going to go through the hands of a hand.
The Great Catacomb, who was in the use of "word" and "word," said that he was trying to misdirect and manage the problem.
The mayor said, "It's going to reverse propaganda and campaigns in the MHP region."
The MHP Secretary-General, who requested that MHP be an important and irrevocable actor of Turkey's policy, said about users:
The former Marchists are not able to destroy the place that the MPP has been doing in the Turkish country.
All processes performed are in an account that is in the back of the applied source management methods.
Because politics and the media have blinded their eyes to the MHP base.
While we are with each other, there is no meaning in our view to those who do good work and show no gratitude.
What's wrong with those who don't use their lives to account for our party?
They have not touched MHP well in their lives, they have not shared our memories, they don't understand our countries, they don't fight, they've always been married, they've got to find another job.
It's an effort to find out where there's unity, conflict and travel relations between those who don't touch the unity and the whole of the National Movement Party.
And he will surely turn his back and strike his master.
The National Movement is the last cat on the foot of the Turkish people, despite the heavy hits.
In his explanation, "political dignitaries", "political gatekeepers" -- "Millions are not free."
He said, "No matter what it is, outside the ocean, the springs that flow from the ocean will not reach their goal."
The MHP, who used the expression "the suspect ghosts are going to go crazy and go mad," was one of the leaders of the MPP's parties and terrorist organizations in his statement, saying, "They will not be able to operate on their own terms from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Persians, from the PKK to the PK," who will not be able to do anything."
We've brought up new tactics and games for those who plan for Turkey without MHP, MHP and MHP without Turkey; MHP without government, we've been fighting for the end of those who want MHP without MHP Meclis.
Now we're gonna break the games, we're gonna destroy the players.
He used the words "MHP's patent" by using Meral Akshener, who said, "It's obvious how I'm going to take the Maho people to Germany, like an old Christmas movie, how I'm going to leave Istanbul on a mountain floor after I'm driving to Germany, and what I'm going to tell you is that I'm going to take you back to my flight."
That's their problem, but they're the new people that we're going to leave these hotels alone.
Signed by Kjaer Sevilla
He signed an official agreement with Kjaer, who was transferred to Sevilla from the Sari-Laciverter team to the Sevilla Betelle and was the most paid defence transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will wear 4 numbers in Seville.
It's easier for baby families than THY.
According to an explanation made by the THY Press Office, the international air carrier who is working to improve its flight experience and its approval is continuing to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In fact, between 0-2 years of age and 2 years of age, children and their families began to use the "baby travel kite" prepared by injecting the needs of their families.
In a special box of kits prepared with a specially designed bag; under-change cover, the single-use mother's front, breast cream, baby lotion and shampoo, the newly-made soft palmmented and blue pedi.
Paraben, alcohol, and non-ferrous chemicals were produced in the presence of the characteristics of the baby’s brain.
Washington, Green Card, Switches the Rules
According to media transmission, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that would change the Green Card rules.
Lawmakers propose that 50,000 rates be reduced per year, more stringent rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family administration visas.
The new rules were offered by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The law will be discussed on both sides of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase money and generate billions of dollars for tax professionals and will change the way Green Card is given to other U.S. citizens.
The law will reduce the prison traffic and replace the existing regime.
This new procedure will benefit English-speaking people, the financial resources available to them and those with the skills that will benefit us in our economy."
Authors included the Phenerbach-Sturm Graz game
I haven't found it in two seasons, I can't see it.
It was a "mangal heart" team that Cocaman was involved in the loss of pain, and he was on his way to make a deal with us.
We can bring it into play, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that's been working for a long time.
The first game he identified, but yesterday's adjectives were on his own line; now the commander of the Fenerbahce area, Valbuena.
There was an old problem when it was transferred, but Kocaman's words had an "excessive character."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atom's wife to Rizya Chalambay.
If it ends, it'll be the closest way to the French player.
He was everywhere, and he attended all his passports, took responsibility for everything, and pulled down one hand with a short hand.
Alper's first play, his second fort position, left the Sturm Graz team "fucked" in the long term.
He always called for a hard wall to pass through the garden without throwing a corner.
They're judges of the group, but they're not producing an active passport in a variety of criminal cases.
This view can lead to the "need for" but we're against a game that doesn't fit into the position of the single centrforon.
Either the team didn't trust a young player or it had to be a little bit further developed.
After the score 1-1, they couldn't take advantage of two net opportunities.
It was important to get through the race, but it was better at night to take this side of the player's fight for "gol" on this side.
One or two new transfers will probably come up to the market.
But the truth is, the biggest need for Fenerbach is for the 12th...
We're in the shade of a very bright and wonderful season with this kind of game that's taking the hearts of the first-person teams trying to play.
Poor Kocaman's machine is putting up his corn, and he needs a little more time.
They're in good condition as a physical quality.
The quality of the game will also grow.
You see that all footballers on the site are more likely to get better.
There's a lot of work to do for a new page tonight.
The height of the sex robots is real and we need to be worried
In fact, a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector is coming up in 2017 when you think you can't handle it anymore.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
In the past five and a half years, the Sorumlu Robot Sciences Foundation (FRR) has published a report on the progress of the sex robots in the next five to ten years.
We have to take their rise seriously, according to Professor Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield, who is a leading professor of robot science and engineering and the founder of the FRR.
The customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the bird and the type of the tree.
Mr. Sharkey said about the release of the new report: "People laugh short but companies really love and we'll see them more."
Modern sex babies are turned into robots that have a hot silicone, which is touched by the likes of which they can breathe, especially by artificial intelligence.
Users can also choose everything from the color of the robot's eye, meme-shaped shape and the type of pattern or color of everything, and select their robots to conform to their own blood.
But it takes a lot of robotic "persons" to show a Stepford girl so much that it gets even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies were converted into silicon-like robots.
For example, RealBotix allows users to personalize (e.g., attract) their own robots according to their characteristics.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots with "Free Farrah" and "Main Wendy" who are developed by the True Company, who come with pre-programmed personalities, who follow the trendy "Fryit Farrah" and "mackery" personality.
True Company's website adds: "Roxxxy Gold has a person who wakes up as soon as possible for your identity."
So whatever you love him, whatever you don't like him, he doesn't like him.
And there's a spirit in the day like real people.
He can be asleep, he can be willing to talk, or he can be "in perfect mode."
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only is true human relations replaced by true human relations, but more than obedient women are the personality traits of women, the most thought-incidental calls that are near Friit Farah.
On the Web site, True Company looks like Roxxxy as a vibrator, but it's for men.
"If a woman can be a vibrator, why don't men be Roxxxy?" says the website.
What's the point is that these sex robots aren't just a fetish or sex players.
Their presence and subsequent complexity indicate more darkness and deepness in our culture, and do not be lured back into a sexual desire by the idea of an optional supplement to sexual equality.
Many men will naturally not find their sex robots, and the FRR is now located on the outer corners of the mining culture.
But those who miss airplanes can be highly educated about how we live.
And many people are not so weird or attacked as to give them the right to be free.
It's not very likely that there's someone else who's involved in sexual assault on women in white Saray when women's rights are threatened in the world.
The Handmaid's Tale TV series's most impressive side of the screen, not all the details, scientific bodies or play-eyes, but how real it felt.
It's a real change for the Gilead community, but it doesn't feel like it's a big change now.
To create more physical similarity for real women (of course, in the space of porn movies) to the extent that these sex robots can as technologically possible.
They want the Creator to feel human beings as they touch them, and their actions are a real body.
But when it comes to their "persons", robots cannot represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There are no activities or past stories, there's nothing that's gonna put their independence in the middle or ruin their whole fantasy of slavery.
In other words, they are the favored slaves.
Or based on 2017: careers.
The U.S. Army's attack on the convoy: dead and wounded...
When Afghanistan's president, Kabili's military forces were targeted by foreign forces active in the country, organized in Karabakh.
1 NATO soldiers and 3 civilians were found to be injured in the explosion of their lives, 5 of the wounded were wounded and 1 were a translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement by NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), NATO forces indicated that during a joint mission with the Afghan National Army, the incineration of the household bomber in the construction of a house bomber was incapacitated.
The injured person's Bagram Air Force has been found under treatment at the U.S. Army Hospital.
There's no risk of the lives of the wounded.
It's on the ground. It's said that the bomber is a Taliban man.
The big nightmare of Trump?
Displaying Mitt Romney as a symbol of a right
The micro-sized families division of the political division of the U.S. electoral division became the reality of the Trump period.
The Christmas and Christmas season was filled with newspapers in the U.S., how to cope with the storm of neighbors who voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow our own filter balloons into my word.
He's less talkin' about it than he's got the power to bring the Trump family together.
I appreciate it because this week my cousin, who lives in Chicago and has a left-wing song with our family, is visiting us in New York.
He reminded me that unity could have a powerful effect on an enemy.
Everyone who has known the Community's brother who's been arguing for ten years about his policy at White Saray is taking the same side, suddenly and strangely.
It's certainly a good thing at dinner's table, but it seems to me like it puts these important risks in a wide range of contexts.
On the left, it was animated by Trump, but the power of the president's landing force created a right-hand killing force for me.
When we're talking about "normality" and Trump, one day we're talking about the fear that his strange behavior can no longer shock.
There's even a much more horrifying scenario where Trump "normalizes right-wing citizens against their own standards" and these look like a sign of a fall.
When Mitt Romney's crazyness is living in nostalgia about the exact version of the novelty: the dog on the back of the car is 14% coming (but at least we knew what it looked like to his tax case) that both of these are really very minor crimes according to Trump.
When the trumpet is gone, the next Community level must be on the mind only to assess the progress it has made.
We took our children to Central Park when we arrived in the south, and you need the biggest and the best three papers you can spend in the city, which you can use by the New York Park department.
Horses are a large, centrally-sized figurines design (all of which make strange pictures are returned to look at behind their own eyes) and their music is a complex form of music.
In other words, there may be a lot of confusion in a city's classroom: high buildings are starting to get more and more complex, the ceilings are beginning to become more exciting, and the city's reality is not realized.
Thirty-five years have gone by, and I haven't completely gone over the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is a wide-ranging business in Northern London.
What's the point is, I'm still a strangely magical experience when I'm flying to Central Park, so two men in two years, one men in 11 years, and two women in 40 years, and they can all spend a lot of time here.
If I could give him a note on your horse, I'd give him a complete note, but no one would have asked a lot of thanks.
On the other hand, it was required to evaluate "my debt" between 1 and 5 years before I received my credit card this week.
It's the same thing in the coffee shop on my street, and it's the same thing as a 15% tree, for what's bought from a fast sale...
The effect of this is not just to slow down what should be an unsolicited transaction at the same time to force a person to gain an event that is not necessary on the server.
When a poor woman in Bonmarsche pretended to be a victim of an apology, I gave her five-year-old credit card to her inside the store.
They've been wearing mejos through 41 degrees.
From the hottest days of my life, the people in Tunceli have flown to Muzur beaches.
He, along with the good printing of hots from his lunch hours, tried to protect himself from the hots of youth, children, old men, women and men who entered the beaches along the Muzur Lake.
In particular, Tunisians living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England have left behind the beaches along the Munzur Chai's border with countries such as Ege or Akdeniz.
Suna Tosun, who took place among those who were hiding in the Münzur Beach, said, "I didn't want to spend my holidays in the west, but it was better to stay in our own villages."
"There's no water like monzur's ice in the world, but Muzur keeps us hidden in these heats."
Hasan the Great, from Germany, said that instead of the East or the Bodrum, they preferred the Münzur tea in Tunisia, and that is why they were not sorry.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with brain pain
This is the second time I left Pistorius' prison to visit the hospital.
Last year, the prison officials were taken to the hospital for the treatment of patients who had been told that they had come to the grave.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder of the first victim by the prosecutors after he was convicted of murder.
In 2013, at the early hours of the Day of Lovers, Steenkamp killed a toilet cabin in Pretoria, directly at the door.
Pistorius claimed that the night he hid his girlfriend in the cage, he was engaged to someone who didn't come in without an invitation.
The prosecutors explained that they thought this was a very rare time, and that Pistorius was once again intent on reparation against the six-year sentence.
The National R & D Merci said he would accept the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the trial could be evaluated this year.
Pistorius, if the defendants succeed, he will face 15 years of imprisonment.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
First match successful
The DPRK's organization has succeeded in offering prayers and views at the Abattürk Airport in the Foreign Frontier Terminal.
In front of the movement of his first hog capel, the story was organized in the Foreign Hats Terminal, where about 200 rounds of rounds of whales were joined.
The Turkish Airways (THY), from the north side, spread a smile in the dark over the mountains that flow into the sacred lands.
The Hac's capital in Ankara has won from Esanboga.
In Kafile, the first time this year, he also took place the city and its neighbours who benefited from the "unlawful right for citizens and citizens" application of this year.
Two Bulgarian Law-enforcement Camp in Greece
According to the statement of the Foreign Office and received by the BTV, two Bulgarian legal camps were held in Greece.
Two Bulgarians were arrested by the police on August 1st.
They were left on the same day as the investigation was under way.
The external surveillance revealed to the BTV that Bulgaria was released later.
The Greek authorities intensified controls on camp-making by boat and still severely punished those who were arrested while being heard in places that were not separated for that purpose.
He's gonna take control of himself.
Look, the judge said the judge could be punished.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to go with his two friends early this month.
Joey Hoffman, who drove Adana and Mersin by car, disappeared in Silifke on 8th of December.
His friends who came with him, despite all the calls, told his family about his situation in the Netherlands before he reached Hoffman.
And when the police were on their way to find a lost tour, their brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
Robin Hoffman, who's in charge of the police here, went to Adana and Mersin by printing missing pieces to find his brother.
Robin Hoffman's brother said that he had received news last 8th of December, "We had a police service in the Netherlands first."
Later, we went to Turkey with two of my friends and took the police here.
We haven't found any news so far.
He said, "We'll stay in Turkey until my brother gets a message."
Welcome to Earth's Second Moon Creen
The world's second largest national sports champion in the 2017 World Championship of Political Youth in Russia has become the second over 400 metres of water.
Younger and Sporter Osman Dear Osman congratulated White Creen Yeshilbashi, who won a gold medal with the message he published.
In Russia, the first day of the 2017 World Championship, Ceren was the second world over 400 metres of water.
When Ceren took his place in his second round with 8 finalists in the park, he was only 27 lines away from the gold medal.
When Elena Lopatina from Russia won the gold medal at 03.18.73 minutes, Ceren won the gold medal at 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women sportsmen at the seminar.
The last word was, "I think I'm dying, Mom."
"I don't want to die, Mom, it's never fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, Elveda" and for her beloved Italian Gloria Trevisan.
Among those who did not receive any further information was Gloria Trevisan, 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and dear Italian Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer from Trevisan's family in northern Italy, heard that two young people had certainly lost their lives, according to information from the English authorities.
The lawyer who asked for a big family of young people was in pain and asked the journalists not to insist on explaining the matter.
I think I'm dying, Mom.
Lawyer Sandri, Gloria said that shortly after the wedding her mother called Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone and when she heard her mom's latest talk she had.
So Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times over two hours after she started at 1:00 p.m.
Trevisan, quoted earlier, says, "Mom, bad things are happening here, it's raining."
We're stuck. We can't get out.
There's some noise, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to open the door, but there was too much noise and the elevator wasn't working."
The last words of Gloria Trevisan were moved to express his concern at the following calls:
Mom, I've spent my whole life in front of my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
There was a life before me; it was never fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't kiss you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Mom.
I'm going to paradise now, and I'm gonna help you out there.
This is an error of the Italian government
Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, both of whom graduated from primary school, were transferred to London in March when they were forced to find work in the north of the country.
Gloria Trevisan, who found a 300-euro job in her country, began working on a job with a steroid (about EUR 2060) in London for a short time.
Lawyer Sandri, Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time financially, "Gloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government must find an immediate solution to this problem."
Italian play for young people who can't afford to work
Gloria's father, Lois Trevisan, also complained, "This is the fault of our government that makes us run away from our youth to find work."
When unemployment in Italy reached 12 percent, there were 40 percent of youth unemployment.
On the rise of this problem, in the last few years, many young Italians have begun to move to Europe in order to be head of England.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment was 110.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi have also been identified as the play of a country that does not allow young people to work.
Reduces redness of milk and chocolate iBH
Rediscover and your chocolate system may sound like it's out of your ears.
But it's a new job to say exactly what's going on: It can help to reduce the symptoms of those who get sick if they get sick.
In the United States 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, this untreated health condition that affects 300,000 people is due to seizures and vomiting, high blood pressure or loss of pounds, and excessive fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington found that the primary amino acid triptophan of the protein in the University of Washington, where it is recommended to reduce fatty acids in patients, helped develop bone marrow resistance.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that he went into surgery in hopes that he would secretly enter the body of the microorganisms stored in the food.
The cells that are capable of attracting the target are compared to cells that maintain their sensitive tissues without harming them.
If the sea is too much to be pollinated, it can lead to disease.
In the tests, there was a type of immune cells that stimulated resistance in the cells that carry a specific bacteria in their lungs.
And the bacteria need triptophan, one of the protein's structural rocks to stimulate the cell's release.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between the development of the cell population that is a part of the bacterium of Lactobacillus Reuters, which is part of our microbiology.'
The more triptophans in their beaks, the more they have, the more they have in their own cells.'
If the same thing happens in humans, L. Reuter and tryptophan are more likely to develop a more stable, less attractive environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a post-doctoral researcher, has found that while working on a type of immune cell that develops resilience, a group of experiments found that it had this type of cell, but that it was of the same type and that another group held in different places did not have it.
The difference between the bacteria, viruses, and mantar populations living on the mede-bean channel is suspected of being related to microbiotics, other than those that are normally present on a mede-beam channel.
There were DNA sequences of Pharaoh's horns, and there were six types of bacteria in the cells in the cells, but it wasn't.
Because they're looking at a sterile environment, I've been given L. Reuters in cases where my microbiosis is scarce and this kind of immune cell is not developed and the immune cells are in the middle.
Researchers have increased L. Reuters in fat to understand how it affects the immune system and then transferred it to less bacterium-free cells, which were then taken from the lungs.
It turned into cells that enhance the stability of the cells.
The active combination, when inhaled from the fluid, resulted in an increase in indol-3-actic acids known as indol-3-actic acid, was one of the most common instances of triptofan metabolism.
Researchers estimate that when triptophan is added to two thirds of the world's population, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but the number of cells decreased by half when triptophan levels were dropped.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people had the same strengths as rats, and that most of us had L. Reuters in the mid-air channel.
It is not known that triptophan by-products from L. Reuters have not developed in humans as if they were in the fields, but that there have been cases in people who have been diagnosed with typtophan-related disorders.
He said, "It's something we're going to want to improve the development of these cells because these cells control the internal circulation of the cells.
Potentially, in situations where L. Reuters exists, the high-level tryptofan is causing this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed a 'diary' with Nemanja Mattic.
The middle-level player believes that on Wednesday night he went out to the first car in front of Sampdoria, Jose Mourinho, Manchester United, signed a "distance" with Nemanja Mattic.
The transfer of 40 million euros from Chelsea to the UEFA Super Cup at the end of the last season in the United States began with a 2-1 Glybination in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup. Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in a position to attack them.
What is more, Maviler, who was released in Asia before the season, had a serious condition of play and could only be released in 45 minutes; he acknowledged that this had to be improved before the Mourinho Premier Lig season began.
Mourinho said, "There's a real need, but my experience, my wisdom, my thinking... he's thinking football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
When he began to form the first 11th for the beginning of the Mourinho season, like Mattic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku came out at Aviviva Staddi.
The Independent concluded this week that Mourinho still wanted 3 more transfers, but the club already realized its own third of its four primary transfers, and insisted on "a complex job".
"Thank you to the club for taking the fourth."
"If they take four out of four, I'll be happier, but they've spent a lot of effort on me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year
According to the Jesuit Social Refaencing Foundation, in 2005, the sexual intolerance rate for 1 person increased to 8 per cent in 2015.
In the last year of Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, most of the unwanted children and 197 young people were killed.
Child psychiatrist Louise Frisen, who is responsible for the same hospital, said, "It can be seen as a general development in the open psycho-sex community where sexual issues are involved."
The lack of sexual satisfaction is known to have no connection with sexual training.
Drug Operation in Izmir
The Retirement Security Administration has organized an F.T.'s home operation on 3 September, at 36 years of age, on the news.
On the call at the house, there was a passion terrace with 33 extacy bars.
The F.T., who flew out of the balcony and worked as a fugitive, was arrested and taken to custody.
F.T.'s security operations were recorded to be in love with fame.
Transfer to New Malatyaspor
From the new team of the Super Lig, Evkur New Malatyaspor, who wore the shape of Kasimpash last season, tied the player to the colors of Turgut Doğan Shahin.
According to an explanation made by a top-level club, a two-year contract was signed with a 29-year-old Canadian player in the transfer process.
In his statement, "The band player in Kasimpash has been given two years' agreement with Turgut Doğan Şahin.
It's good for our new Malatyaspor."
A micro-cip sequencer for entering his home and car with a powerful British hand move
He was the first person in the country to open the front door, access the office, and even operate his car with just one hand.
Steven Northam (33), who raised his hand between his fingers and his thumbs, and this service is now described by BioTeq's signature of jobs and people who want to simplify their lives with technology.
In order to ensure that the implant process can be applied to medical standards, Winchester went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hunts.
Technology, cats and dogs are like microchips, and only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will make changes in the doors in the houses and in the cars so that it can fit into a bet.
A man who has a husband and a child's father has this technology on BMW Z4 and he works when he's in the direction of his hand.
The White House exhibition was hosted by thousands of tax collectors.
According to the military records that were explained to TIMEE, a total of $24,000 was paid to air passengers on board a ship in the southern coastal market for an organisation that was responsible for the production of white Saray last month.
When the president came, Marine One was also an organization known as the white and white Sikorsky VH-3D, which recognized American construction programs on 17th of December.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and noble White Saray members have been carrying out their productions throughout the 50 countries.
A helicopter made at Connecticut, a plane from Main, a train from Wisconsin and a helicopter from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter required the white Saray Harp Daires, only 36 hours before entering the south for the "unsubstantiated" organization (also called FRAGO).
"I just wanted to make sure that you understood it because it was a highly visible organization," wrote an e-mail.
The message indicated that the helicopter's southern shape would come for the 3rd organization on 17th of September, and that it would stay there until the 6th of September.
Nott, if it's too late to leave White Saray, adds that a second flight team will need to return because of the time limit.
While I was in the air when security personnel stood in the air, the original flight management organization was in the helicopter.
It is not clear that a second flight manager is not required in the end of the records provided for the TIME.
The Hatch Law regulates the use of government property by federal employees for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is asking if the organization does not comply with this condition.
The commander wrote, "We have a question that doesn't violate the Hatch Law and has been informed that he hasn't done it to us."
"It looks like you've been kidnapped," said the Commander.
The "Made in America" organization is officially designated by the White Saray and does not enter into the Hatch Act.
But official organizations are becoming political leaders.
The organization's president, then the continued health services, changed their efforts to reform and put their government plans in motion.
The use of marine One or Air Force One as known air transports is not very new to the political objectives.
The presidents must use these to travel.
But it's because they're just asking for an opportunity to take a picture.
Trump took note of the first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday morning, when the main plane was moved back to the scene of the first rally, and he was taken into consideration when he was given a message about the use of the Twitter account's lead plane.
White Saray Press Assistant Lindsay Walters said: "The White Saray is excited about the 'Made in America' history of products made by American workers from all 50 countries."
HMX-1 often conducts training flights in Washington, D.C., and trains U.S. President White Saray in the south.
In Germany at the beginning of the Trump Temmus, HMX-1 performed 58 physical exercises in White Saray.
One expert said that the flight for the Made in America organization, the air traffic controller said he needed education within that month.
One helicopters spent 11 hours that day for "non-privileged support tasks."
White Saray said they didn't charge any other number in the tax organization.
A word from Sikorksky said that the helicopter didn't participate in setting up a solar system.
HMX-1 doesn't hold the bulk records for head flights, and it's hard to determine the final departure from the organisation.
But according to an hourly position of the Defence Force for the financial year 2017, the Defence Force's VH-3D airport is $24,340 at the start of the flight.
The first records record the flight time of the air transport from the centre of Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia for 30 minutes.
The white Saray helicopter says it's under a lot of pressure.
Walters said, "It's very wrong to take a walk out of the field with your friends, sometimes with the idea of a place of honor."
"They're supposed to capture the sun's assets within the staff, the watch and the year-on-year."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the defense guard does not include personnel drivers who are in charge of the protection guard, but fire, surveillance and contract drivers.
At the time, White Saray's former press dictionary, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters for this organization.
Spicer said, "This week, the anaphylactic thing is going on here in America."
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think that even if there are no thousands, hundreds of people are involved in this.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans are working hard to do.
Surely it is proper to do so."
It's not clear that Trump didn't come into contact with helicopters when he was driving for his organization, but he took the driver's seat in an elevator.
In White Saray, he was surprised by the company's productions in his own home with the media and the Sikorsky representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorksky very well." He said, "I have three of them."

Narcon 3rd season break: The Cali Carteli is on the front line with Pablo Escobar on Netflix's hit list
Although Pablo Escobar's murder occurred in the second season, Netflix's order doesn't seem complete.
The third and fourth season has already been recommended by the Internet service, and the first time it takes its first fragment, it gives us some idea of the bad characters in front of us.
With the third season, DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug racer: Cali Carteli
They're run by their four powerful mafia father and run "like a Fortune 500 company," but more government robbery and violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis), Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) and is speaking in New York by Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote).
In the new emerging fragment, Pedro Pascal, an American and Colombian colloquium, turns back as Javier Peña, a character that supports the fight against drug abuse.
Among other new players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be published for the first time on 1 July.
According to B.M., the role of women in the political role of African democracy is linked to the political role of women
On Wednesday, the beginning of his mission in Afghanistan, B.M. said women in the community could represent the elections in the role of all members of the community.
B.M. Aid Mission representative Nicholas Haysom says that hundreds of women competed in government councils, competed for the support of three women, and had recently been registered as women over 30 percent.
She said in her Sunday talk, "We can't ignore the role of women."
Elections only involve women as a whole and can be really representative and reliable if they are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan state council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 November.
Taliban has been in danger of the electoral process when international military operations turn to the task of speaking.
These annual elections represent the transformation of power from one government elected for the first time as a democratically elected.
Unfortunately, women's strong role is that of Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women have been registered from 3.6 million registered elections.

The charge of stealing to Netanyahu
According to a report commissioned by the Israeli police, President Binyamin Netanyahu was "in doubt as to whether he had been robbed of his innocence."
There was no record of Ari Harov's "witnessed in the Netanyahu district" of his previous stories.
The ongoing questions about President Netanyahu are "inconsistencies in the trade with a media boss who has taken undue money from the public, and who has made a market with a media boss, and who has been taken from Germany."

GMB concern at an investment in McGatie's Glasgow factory
A syndicate wants confidence in the long-term investigation into the production of McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
GMB told Iceland that the company had remained silent about the future investment in Tollcross.
Over 500 people are working at the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea were created.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested more than five million stars in the region in recent years.
He added that if there's a change in operations, those who work and trade union representatives will be "really informed."
In a letter to the company's foundation manager, GMB Eskočer asked McVitie to "take care not to provide funds for the modernisation of production teams".
GMB's senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said: "Thesis is deeply concerned about our members' lack of commitment to Tollcross's investment plan for the future.
Families have been working here for generations and in a situation where there is social unemployment in the local community and high unemployment as a result of unemployment as a result of unemployment, where there is sufficient demand for a sufficient level of criticism in Glasgow and the banks.
In view of the work, wages and fresh prospects, Brexit's skills, past and chronic decline in production are urgently needed for four main mammoth productions in Glasgow's green McVitie."
A woman from Pladis said: "Tollcross's corporate manager has received a letter from the GMB Iskochia today and the company will be very grateful to our employees for our commitment to the union representatives.
We've been working on Tollcross two months ago with GMB representatives, and we've been having a regular meeting with a number of issues that were clearly discussed.
Then we told our employees, as well as all companies working in an uncertain economic environment, that we were able to be recipients, that we were constantly reviewing our operations for all our work and our foundations.
He added: "In those years, we've invested more than five million stars in Tollcross's technology, especially in production bands and operational development.
We know all about Tollcross's heritage as a production component and those who work for any change in our resistance operations and their union representatives will know first."
Necip and Utku in 4 more years
The division club, Necip Oysal and Utku Yuvakuran have been in the process of four years.
On the TFF website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), the area where football is given was located, it was concluded by the two players until 31 May 2021.
In 2009-2010, Necip, who had reached his first professional agreement on 19 April 2008, began wearing a form in the A team.
A 1991-born player, who was raised to the rank of the team, played a total of 254 games.
Also on the TFF website, the trainer Utku Yuvakuran, who had entered the framework as a last season's rent, received information that he signed a deal with him until 31 May 2021.
Utku was released on 1 August 2017 from transitional transfer status and was updated on the Internet on 2 August.
Utku Yuvakuran has been responsible for more than 21-year-old league games in Pejiktaš, which last season is playing.
The young hunter, in black and white form, was only responsible for meeting the 2 Turkish Cup.
PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's leaving?
La Liga may have regretted her concern with Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain, after an offer for 189 million euros of free will, will not leave Neymar, but have they warned Barcelona about the global rainforest three years ago?
The Ligue 1 team, with Paul Pogba coming back to Manchester United last season for 89 million euros, has launched a sensory transfer period with more than two sides of the previous metric that was ready to break the world transfer record.
The PSG shows that when the transfer is completed, it will be the world's most paid player and the most winning professional sport.
Although the management of the Catalans is known to be angry with Barcelona's way of offering and its efforts to separate Neymar from the movement from Santos in 2013, despite the fact that the club has always insisted on its best efforts to listen to him.
Well, was the football world warned three years ago by the head of the PSG?
When she expressed her interest in signing in Manchester City Blaise Matudii in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi gave a strong warning to all the fellows who wanted to sign one of the best players in the PSG.
Al-Khelaifi said: "I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our players, we will attack them and they will attack them."
"We respect all the slaves.
But if they come to sign to one of our players, they will be among the losers."
The Spanish club in Barcelona at the beginning of this letter appears to have crossed this line by expressing its interest in Marco Verratti, the PSG middle-level player.
PSG has found that the Italian people will not allow any condition to be separated, and Barcelona feels better about this concern by losing Neymar from its greatest value.
The penalty for forbidden read-in was cancelled
Countess who have been alleged to have tried to stop my little Gültpe Army Professor Mustafa Baki from walking on the ledger, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Don't "do not help him with his being able and willing to go to bed with him", "Don't go back to make a sacrifice" and "damage" from the crimes of Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Court.
Taking into account the fact that Gülshen was guilty of a "extreme duty" and of the form of criminal proceedings, he was sentenced to a sentence of 7,000 litres of silver and a sentence of 1 year prison, which prevented him from making debts to Gülma, given the importance of the crime history and the time frame for the future of the community and Turkey.
Eyatt ordered that the prison sentence given to Yümak be turned into a six thousand litres of money.
After two counts of money were fined, a number of lawyers were found seeking a trial.
The Court of Justice of Istanbul 23 on file transfer.
He's coming to justice.
In order to complete their findings, the law of the "harvest" sentence applied in connection with the offence of Count Kenan Gülşen was found to be in conformity with the law of the "harvest" who applied it in relation to the criminal case, as required by the law of the prosecution to comply with the type of crime provided for by the law, it was appropriate to refuse the sentence given on the conviction.
When I met my priest Mustafa Baki, who was reading from the District Court of Justice, I read from Nait Yümak's cell. "What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you going to get out of the way?"
He's got his coroner.
"It's over," he said, "that's it." He said that his act of act as an attacker, that my powerful priest had to read with certain differences, and that he could not read the hall, was determined by the fact that he "do not come back to make a sacrifice" by accepting the fact that the accused was guilty.
Despite the fact that there was a need for the local court to determine what was needed by the court, it was clear that the action was carried out during the time of the completion of the duty of reading and the public was notified before the court that, in the case of a case, there was no duty which began or continued to be carried out, that the public duty of the file did not constitute an offence for the purpose of causing injury and that it was deemed necessary to provide evidence of how the attempt to prevent the execution of the duties later.
The lack of justice, the lack of justice, the lack of access to information, the lack of access to information about the material damage, the lack of access to information and the lack of access to information about the material damage caused by the crime, and the lack of access to information about whether or not there was a ban on the execution of the judgment.
The Court of Justice, the DESCRIPTION OF THE DESCRIPTION, decided that the first court ruling on the case-law of Nait Yülma was based on these requirements.
6 European in Interpol's live bomb list
German newspaper Die Welt wrote that last May, the terrorist organization Interpol (International Police Organization) had sent a list of 173 people to security organisations in the European countries with the potential to organize terrorist attacks on the name of DEACH.
The 132 on the list were reported from Iraq, North Africa, the Kurfez countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of them were listed as European citizens.
These people are from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
A person with a DEACH connection from Germany was informed that he was a 27-year-old German citizen of the Northern Ren Westphalia State of Solingen.
In the latter part of 2012, it was stated that Egypt, then Turkey, finally went to Syria.
The statement made by DEAH in the middle of our history from social media accounts is recorded as explaining that this man died in Rakka.
The German Immigration Agency has been informed that it has not reported any issues related to the press.
The names on Interpol's list have been moved to progress in operations directed at DEACH in Musul.
According to The World, the U.S. intelligence services sent this list to Interpol.
Interpol's list of words was also recorded in May for police organizations in Europe.
Die Welt indicated that some of the names on this list of ISID's names can be found in the entry into Europe to edit attacks.
The military success of the pumping ball: The 5-year-old Star could lose his eyes
In Job, he shed blood in front of the young men's soldiers.
A group of poor people gathered at the park in Karadolap Mahallesi to make their friends go to the army last night.
According to the idea, time was set up in the group with U.S. bomb blasts.
After the army was defeated, the group began to divide.
In the course of the game area with the children, M.K., he shot a hand in the ground with a pumping bullet.
Because of the dirt from the ground, the 1st boy sitting in the park bank was injured by 5 people.
At that time, the park's security cameras were on the other side.
The wounded were taken to hospitals around Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balker, Star Unus, and Inni-Caya ambulances.
The 5-year-old Star Unus was diagnosed as facing the risk of losing his left eye.
Mary Kaya's mother told DHA at that time.
The stone that told you what happened when the tower was on fire began at 8:00 a.m.
It's been two hours.
The army's all over.
Young people started spreading.
It's gonna be like we're gonna get up by the end.
That was when he shot the gun. It was right in front of me.
It's not good for my tower.
He's got one hundred to lose his eyes.
We talked to the doctor, he said.
They pulled one out of the shit in the other.
He said, "There's an operation, maybe 10 operations."
The suspect M.K. and the U.S. were arrested by the United Nations Security Council teams.
After police interrogations, two people who were in love with names were arrested.
