Members of the Wells National Assembly are worried that "they look like maps"
Some members of the congregation were surprised by their proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Great Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Great Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this may be a subject of ridicule.
A member of the congregation of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that "it's Roman with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak big words: on big twp means "buulness/ mad", and pwp means "how".
A member of Plaid said the party in general "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party's work is "freedom" for the change of name, but he noted that the similarity between the words MWP and "mappet" (ang Muppet) is great.
In this context, the great letter "w" is spoken similar to the Yorkshire-English expression "u".
The Commission of the People's Congregation, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision for which the members of the congregation are to be named, of course, will bring the members themselves."
The Wells government law of 2017 gave the Wells congregation power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of consultations with the public on proposals that showed great support for the appointment of the congregation as the Great Parliament.
For the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers Members of the large Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the highest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus can lead to headaches for the congregation's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
The Macedonians will vote at a referendum to change the name of the country.
The voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name in "Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Atina has long insisted that the name of her northern neighbour represents a right to her territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an anti-pplebiscytat for a change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change in name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's funeral was celebrated while the churches in Harlem faced problems
"History, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer day-to-day rooms in the villages where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they started."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by building buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the village.
"Most people buying apartments in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why the day these churches are closed will come to an end because it's unlikely that most people who live in these buildings will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem to become the metropolitan area of the blacks — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original assembly of white-methodists was settled in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith in the neighborhood takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken from the blacks assembly during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the fight against the 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was very damaged in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parish members had plans to build it again, they bought the trailer.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the Carolion "the Voice of the Poor".
The expert who played the violin in July called it "cultural wealth" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first violin in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest violin in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the church's infamous leaders, and part of the Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal.
The church council – the governing body of the church, composed of non-profit leaders – wrote to the EPP in July with concern that the EPP "will require him to transfer his costs" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the implementation of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent it.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the parish.
Aikula hurt a 13-year-old child when he was in California for ironing.
Aikula attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while a yacht truck in California, on the day of opening the yacht season, the authorities said.
The attack took place about 7 hours ago near the beach of Bikon in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel said about KSWB television in San Diego that he had been sneaking out with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and then went to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was an excitement to get clear, but then "he realized that he said, 'I'm late!
I'm late!'
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hamel added.
The boy was taken to the helicopter at the Children's Hospital Radi in San Diego, taken as a critical condition.
He doesn't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told the press conference a few weeks ago that there was a shark in the area, but they decided that the shark is not of a dangerous nature.
Gilles added that the victim was hit by traumatized injuries in the upper part of the truck.
The authorities closed the beach from the beachside Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sanisbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with jewelry shoes in stock-style houses full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household are declining, large beauty crafts will be tested in 11 shops everywhere in the country and will be presented in more shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of guns that was once designed for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's they said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-starts its series of Boutique makeups, so most products are suitable for vegans, which is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the trader with perfumes Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, from which the first opened in Creedon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham, a year later.
Buying online and the trend to buy less food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Kup, director of Sainsbury's, said that salesmen will increasingly look like stores because the supermarket synergy is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and products that don't eat.
Sainsbury's began to become sellers of Argos in hundreds of shops, and also introduced numerous Habitat vendors after buying them and the two syndicates two years ago, which they believe increased the sale of tranquilizers and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested joint ventures with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement on how to share the profit of chemical dealers in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical salesmen from Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Syner for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for him on his skin including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, the business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the look and feel of our outfits for beauty to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in special trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our brandy series is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a worthy destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "beg" after Holly Willowby withdraws from the contract worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones from Dragons Den has gone "fascin" after TV driver Holly Willowby withdrew from an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his brandy business for life-style to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their Truly brand for household products and supplements.
Both business is linked to the Goop brand of Gunettet Paltrow.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram that he's leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, withdrawing from their profitable branding business for the life-style lately to focus on her new big agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "faint" when a television gold girl admitted during a tennis meeting on Tuesday at the seat of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer has time to dedicate herself to their brand Truly for household products and supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Gunettet Paltrow and it was said to double William's wealth by 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he left Truly, Jones soon left Britain on one of his weekends.
One source says: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
That was supposed to be her long-term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them completely unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to opening.
Marlow's seat has a stock full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's leader, one of Britain's most paid stars, can make the company millions because of large investments in pennies and candles products, and also to clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, mother of three children, and his wife, Dan Boldwin, has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Both go to holiday together and Jones has a share of 40% of Boldwin's TV production company.
Willowby has to become Ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Anton McCpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity (I am a star) of ITV.
A source close to Jones yesterday said "We don't comment on his business moves".
A Serious Conversation “And Then We Felt In Love ”
He was laughing at the criticisms he would receive from the media about giving comments that some would consider "non-presiding" and because he is so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Tramp give up so many things?
Tripp said with his voice recast as a "representer of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclearization.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders of the UN Main Assembly that the North does not see "a suitable response" from the United States for the early moves of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure.
Trap takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the meeting.
"We agree well with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been in a war with North Korea.
They're gonna kill millions of people.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – completed rocket tests, helped free prisoners, and the other American soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to communication with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trapp said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Tunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need it.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok has been displaced, there has not been an elemental accident, which is a condition for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although "Save the children" is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that continue to strike Indonesia, the country remains hopelessly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although they have built tents for tsunamis in Aceh, they are not usually seen in other neighborhoods.
The apparent lack of siren to warn against tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued, was likely contributing to the loss of life.
In the best time, travel through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters add up more and more to the problem of logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of earthquakes is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
The main point in President Joko Vidodo's election campaign was improving old infrastructure in Indonesia and he spent a lot of money on roads and others.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the next year's elections.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, spears, and other ancient weapons.
Look: Daniel Starg from the Liverpool team at the same time against Chelsea
Daniel Stark saved Liverpool from losing the Prime Minister's lead league in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stafford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Starg's ball some 30 yards from Chelsea's head, while his team lost from 1 to 0.
He transferred the ball from left to right before turning it into a distant article.
The ball moved high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the network.
The peak finally passed through the jumped Cape Arisabalag and fell into the network.
"You were just trying to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starj told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I was just kidding."
Chelsea took 1 – 0 in half the time after the sign star Eden Hazard took off in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the "Blues" went back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before the ball hit almost half the ground, and then suddenly passed half of Liverpool.
They've been working with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed the projectile, leading Hazard into the 16th century.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in a remote article network with a left leg hit by Alison Becker in Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. in the middle of the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia jumped to 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia dropped by 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the earthquake with 7.5 force on Friday and caused fires with a height of 20 steps, said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by a flood of broken buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
It's started a murder investigation since a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhad, Mercedes.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. with violent wounds by Grayson Moves on John Street, and 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to say.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would ask the people who were near the John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspiciously contact us.
Also, I want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken something from the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
The police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhad and that she was found in an object.
Yesterday, friends who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and as the police have said, they will inform the people close to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moves was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him he wasn't allowed to go in, not even out of the building.
He remained silent when he discovered what had happened.
Now they were told that they'd be back in hours before they could go back.
One heard how a policeman told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman with tears in her eyes.
She always repeats "so terrible".
Two police vans were in the corner at 2 p.m. and one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the corridor watching the apartments.
Any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Fighters against Crime of 0800 555 111 by citing 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's status in Parliament has become the most recent memory attack in the "recording of History" casino
Her persecution would be a poetic justice for his "taliban" destruction of a large number of cultural and religious artifacts produced by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "poisonous" and "an attempt to record history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current process of eradicating states, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Western House would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English civil war was neither ordered nor issued by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the work of his predecessor, Thomas, in the past century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell to Sir William Hamo Torneycroft is evidence of the 19th century’s thinking and part of the figure’s history that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people think, perhaps in the late 19th century more than today, that Cromwell is a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether this is a complete correct representation is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the immediate development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure that represents a part of that division.
His achievements as Lord-protector also deserve to be praised and mentioned."
The pig killer broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
Dogs attacked and killed a farmer on the market in Southeast China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Yuan", was found dead with skin artery, buried in a blood truck near the market in Lipanshui in Gizzo, South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farms on 30 May 2005 in Xinging in Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with the cousin of the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of the nearby pigeon.
He said there was a big vein in the car with blood on the mussel.
The French investigation confirmed that the 550 pounds heavy vampire broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, given the nickname "Wu", according to the quote in the evening news of Guang.
The camera photo showed Javan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong either to Javan or to his brother.
The market manager reported on the evening news that pigs were locked to prevent other people's attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Javan's family and market officials reportedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of dogs that attacked people have been reported earlier.
In 2016 she attacked her wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical damage to her husband.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds [650 pounds] of pigs dragged a large farmer to his tractor until his wife had thrown the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was expelled from his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to be Greek, they're very loving... they don't want to hurt anyone purposely.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will bring a natural rain in the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves through the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rain rains in the northern part of Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, hurricane from category 1 of 5.00 a.m. on Sunday and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on a week.
Meanwhile, depression on the Pacific Ocean begins and moves east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the South California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to enter a large tropical region north of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain into Mexico's business on Monday.
Then, the tropical storm with the approaching depression will cause heavy rains in the southeastern over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, floods and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical storm will cause floods that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the works of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Emergency floods are caused by rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Especially is it recommended not to walk into the desert when possible from tropical rain.
The current rain may cause the cannons to become turbulent rivers, and the stormtime with the gremotives will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local native rain on parts of South California.
There may be more than half an inch of rain, which can cause rivers from debris and wet roads.
This would be the first rain in their winter season.
Timely tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late in the week and early in the morning on Monday, before the rains spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The spring rain will spread into "the four corners" on Tuesday and last until midnight.
In October there are expected intense changes in U.S. temperature everywhere due to Arctic ice, but tropical boundaries remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in the central parts of the United States weekly.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Misuri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try again and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a hot start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees south-east.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our longer-term forecast shows the possibility of solar temperatures for U.S. eastern parts until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting witness on Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assaults that reportedly took place in the 1980s, Cristina Blasie Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the undisclosed political situation continued, with specters that interrupted regular programs for the conversion at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flick, Senator of Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that it was 100% sure that Kawano was drunk and tried to get her clothes off the high school party.
Kawano, in his extensive testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company counted the average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with measuring people who look at the offices.
To make it look better, it's a public with a size similar to a playoff contest in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, which clear leaders have severely attacked Kawano's appointment, led across all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flyk was a central figure in the fifth drama.
After the Republican office died issued a statement that he would vote for CNN and CBS cameras arrested him as protesters on Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes while they crossed him, and all of that was transferred to CNN's life.
"They stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth about the country"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Fleck said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
The cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee had to vote to advance the nomination of Kawano in the voting Senate.
But Flick said he would do it only if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the minority Democrats.
Flyk was partially convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kansas, and with a few senators later, Flyk made a decision.
Flick's election was of great importance because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to vote on Kawano without an investigation.
President Tramp opened an FBI investigation into charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the flag
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "completely exhausted".
Shooting in Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Dieon Simson for the death of a sportsman at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the state university of Louisiana.
Twenty-year-old Deton Simpson was arrested and taken to prison under a second-degree homicide charge, Baton Rouge's police department said.
The authorities announced a video from the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the raid.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB partner of CBS said.
After Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he had been shot in Wade and killed him.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The parish office of East Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is a shot wound in the head towards the door.
The Department thanks the unit for refugees of the Louisiana state police, the criminalist police lab, the South University police and the assisted citizens of the area that they gave in the investigation that led to arrest.
The Athletic Director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activation in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6,6 footback grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the state university of Louisiana.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the basketball team at the Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "damaged" and "in shock" from Sims' death.
"This is what you're worried about without stopping," said the trainer.
Vulcan threw a map on Mexico City
Explosion of the ashes from the volcano Pocabettel reached the southern settlements of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it started crater activity and 183 gas and pepper emissions were registered for 24 hours.
The center was following more tattoos and looking.
Social media images show a thin layer of paper on cars in the densely populated places of Mexico City, such as Sochimillo.
Geophysicists noted an increased activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the year of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protesters clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the Rival demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising vote for defeat of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and colors right, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later that day, they also broke down the stairs, and the police used the stairs to tear down the stairs.
For more than a few hours independence groups have called "There's no forgetting, no forgiveness," and on the other hand, union protesters have called "Long live Spain".
Forty people were treated for minor injuries suffered in protests, reported from local press.
Tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterised the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but the same was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
Most voters voted for independence, even though the output was small because of the fight by the people who opposed the repression.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police violently tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups camped on Friday night to stop demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixteen-eight-year-old electrician, Narciss Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would have an opportunity to get independence.
"Last year we lived one of our favorite moments.
I've seen my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the vital but close victory of last December's regional elections, the Catholic parties for independence have tried to keep the dynamic year with many of their most famous leaders or in a self-elected trial or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, recording the protest for police support, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It gets all potential," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkers, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that they will apply for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after killing a car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly killing a car at home in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Crest on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said it caused damage to the capital and the city itself.
At one point he might be shot by a gun from his car.
Menga's hit led to Livingstone's 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone provides victory
Advanced Livingstone arrested the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit showed how significant it was as Gary Holdd's country jumped for a level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side remained unbeatable in the first season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which eight points remain.
Before that, the Rangers will be home to Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to win the division in six races, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since the replacement of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed the chance against the cruel guests.
Holt's team was supposed to take a long time before they gave it to the hungry, and their directness caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but pulled the attack around the neck, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after he hit the head of Craig Halket's head over the neck.
Guests were pleased to let the Rangers play before them, knowing they could create problems with their actions.
And that's exactly how the judge came.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone got open, Declan Galager and Robinson together installed Menga, who just took a bullet from the centre of the 16th century.
By then the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the domestics, so the Bolman Liam Kelly didn't play most.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is producing rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the skill of Ranger's goal, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action in Livingstone.
Sixteenths of Livingstone were constantly passing through and was constantly protected, while two panel requests – after Halket challenged Glen Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal game and results for Livingstone
They were great, continuing to go beyond the expectations of this lofty road.
Their style and character of playing hardly changed after their return to the top, but most of the service goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was extraordinary, running a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Connor Goldson and Joe Waral at the ready.
The Rangers still had their inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard’s leadership, they are now living by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the homes – and it's a little insight to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan got mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They got worse because of problems involving human rights, freedom of printing and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colonia to open a huge new gym.
The city is the home of Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the gym, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurdi, also clarified, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposers portray the visitor's share as a hero from some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat from others.
Traffic accident on the road to Deptford: A passenger died in a car crash
A passenger died in a car crash in London.
The conflict took place near the intersection of the streets of Beswood and Evelyn, a bus with a large footrace in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and suddenly came to help, but the man died in an accident.
The trial took place a few months after the death of another passenger in a traffic accident on the streets of Chaders where the driver fled about a thousand of the attack on Saturday.
The Metropolitical Police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his family.
The road blocks are set up and the buses are moved and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a man's high-security prison, reported from the prison office.
The disturbances occurred at HMP Long Martin in Worchesshire about 9.30 BST a week and still last.
The Tornado unit specialists were brought to resolve the disturbances, which include eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police are being treated for minor damage to the place.
The prison spokesman said: “Special trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the current HMP Long Lartine incident.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the police will be responsible for it and can spend additional time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartine has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order and peace police were called into prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The Russians are threatened by Fenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with heavy floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression is rarely happening to hit Arizona, but it will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining strength of hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, risking sudden floods.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, all to the south and east Nevada, southern California and Yuta, including the cities of Fenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move on the direct route through Fenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state meteorology station in Fenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles [1950 km] of Fenix!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the state centre for hurricanes provide 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the work of Mongolia in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert south-west region, including the central parts of the Caribbean Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for forced flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. dry tracking body, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona is faced with extreme drought, the second highest category," air.com said.
First, the route of the hurricane Rosa has led to a landslides everywhere on the low California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane force on Sunday morning with winds of maximum 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm is coming in contact with cold water in the Pacific and shrinks.
Thus, rain is expected in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and represent a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain," said weather.com.
Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Yuta until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remnants is a lot of heavy rains in Lower California, South-West Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," said the Urugans State Centre.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and floods of debris, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsammer Northon: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old found with rape wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Exelzior Terrace in Midsamer Northon about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in a stable condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had any photos of the case's cell phone.
Tripp said that Kawano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for the Kawano judge is a voice for rejecting the most serious and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump of a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tripp said that Cavano "has endured the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kawano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally, ignoring Christina Blassi Ford's accusations that he had made half an attack on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford witnessed the hearing and her charges.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of the Cavano on that day.
"The positive vote for the Kawano judge is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal attitudes of our time, a lawyer with an irrefutable record of public service," he said before the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president directly mentioned the nomination of Kawano while speaking about the significance of the outlet of the republicarians of the early elections.
"An additional five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Tripp said that democracies have a mission to "repudiate and prevent".
The first key vote for the nomination of Cavano in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, an old GOP leader for CNN said.
Hundreds died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims increased
At least 384 people have died, many have been taken by massive waves that hit the beaches when large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian island of Slavèsi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when fires of 6 meters (18 steps) hit the coast of the desert, bringing many to safety deaths and destroying all their way.
After the earthquake of 7.5, he hit the tsunamis.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people still carried out their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesman for a disaster relief agency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, pulled cars, trees, houses, hits all over the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was travelling through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and a watery neighborhood.
The follow-up earthquake continued to rock the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, even the coast, is likely to strengthen the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "failure" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the roof of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be increased along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that it did not inform the tsunamis that it hit Palu, although the authorities said the defences came at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared by the social media, a man can listen to the building's top cadets as he calls it unreasonable, warning people on the street down for the tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, the water wall is shut down on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the picture right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power cuts that cut off communications around Palu, putting them on the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were housed in ceremonies in their office courtyard, they walked through desert scenes, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Even while relief groups began their dark efforts to start disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to arrive if the place of the disaster has been declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can get international help, but there's still no status."
As the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday the rescuer saved a woman who had been dragged under the couch for two days with her mother's body to her.
Geddon Subbandno, the trainer of the Indonesian state paralagry team, trained two of the missing paralagliers for the Asian games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Manddi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how, when she began to circling news about breaking up the Roa Roa Hotel in the paralagderist community, he accidentally sent messages to whatsApp's competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a grey sign of scissors, rather than with a son.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they filled the bank account at "Newport of Cayote"
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee in Brink's who added the banknote to the "Newport of Cayote", according to Newport's police station press release.
The driver of the car emptied the banknote into the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis Mecarti in the statement.
While he was arrested, another man ran "from behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noted more suspects as they fled the crime scene, according to the report, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact Newport's police at 859-292-3680.
Kane West: The rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kane West changed his name to Ya.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature was formerly known as Canya West".
Forty - one - year - old West carried over to her for a while and used it for her eight album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to publish his new "Yandhi" album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the show that had to give up "emotional reasons", the performer said.
Although he uses it as a short summary of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'she' is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there means 't'," West said at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with the director Big Boy.
"What I mean is you, it's us, it's us.
He left the land of Canaan, meaning the only one, to Him alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more an example of what we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his prejudice over the names of Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former West co-operater, Jay Zie, also uses his name with or without a drawing and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises he won't use the military on civilians
VD president of Mexico Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador promises that he will never use military force against civilians until the country reaches 50 years of bloody repression against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the Mexican people's repression army".
The military shot peaceful protesters at the 2nd floor of October 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time of the left-wing student movement in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is convinced that he will support young Mexicans by giving them monthly help to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double its field research resources, the investor and practitioners for AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in technological intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The allocation of the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far away from the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The allocation of funds may double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will do so in the US, Li said in an interview for CNBC Sunday.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published a month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who invests in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Karnegi Melon University worked on a system of engineering that won the highest ranked American horse player, and later he was director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's border in China.
Are they grateful for previous US government technology competitions as a challenge to the Agency's robotic approach to further research projects in the defence and asks when the next competition will be to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States should often work hard to get state borders, Li said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
He said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think "green cards" should be offered to doctors of science by artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of work is low in China, Li said.
Last year the U.S. Defence Ministry set up a Joint Intelligence Centre, which should include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the formation of the National Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for the initiative called "AI Next".
With regard to NSF, more than $100 million is currently invested annually in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of a National Committee for the Safety of artificial intelligence had no month-to-month activities.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece blocking its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and places its flag on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and the boycott campaign questioned whether the output would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum leader's question was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying to allow EU and NATO entry into the body for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make decisions.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the output was 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters gave their vote.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," 62-year-old Joeshe Tanevski, a voter in the capital city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in Macedonia's referendum to change the name of the country, which will open the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
Before the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of chairs set up by people who would fight the referendum.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head up high, not from the back entrance," Kawadarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be treated as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary output.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 per cent of voters are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote with yes.
For the referendum to succeed, the output should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious hit on Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed the entire defense of Brighton for the Gol
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly took control of Briton's defense in the 2 – 0 battle for Manchester City on the Etikhad Stadium Saturday in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his stroke look so simple in the 65th minute.
Argentinian attacker has been given an average of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He's been running between three defense players in Briton before he got into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four greens.
About one defense player before he hit a few others on a job from the 16th century B.C.E.
Then he put his left hand on Sterling.
The English attacker used his first visit to the 16th century to return Aguero's ball, which with his right foot beat the brayton goal, Matthew Ryan, with a single hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," City manager Pep Gvardiola said to the journalists.
"We were talking to play 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave me a hole at that time."
But the initial advantage of "the heavenly sons" gave Sterling in the fight for the League's Prime Minister.
The wolf came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Briton's territory in that game.
He sent a wonderful direct ball along the left side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before she took Sterling to the far-off article.
The "heavenly Sons" attack brought the ball into the network before it got out of the car.
City will fight Hofenheim in a team of the League of Champions on 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rain-Nekar Arena, Germany.
Sherner wants to play a player against Rokis.
Since Neshnells was eliminated from the playoff struggle, there was no reason to force another start.
But the competitive Sherzer is always hoping to stay in the central square a week against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for the playoff for the Rokis team, which are leading a competition before Los Angeles Dogers in the Western National League.
Rokis' team had at least a "joker" for a place with 5-2 beats over Neshnels on Friday night, but they still struggle to establish their place in the first division.
"Although it's not playing for anything, at least we can throw it out knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level than any moment I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't you want me to compete with that?"
Neshnels still need to announce a starter for a week, but apparently they are reluctant to let Sherzer go into such a situation.
Sherner, who's gonna start on the 34th time, trained to throw up on Thursday and usually throw away on Sunday.

Tramp Mithins in West Virginia
The president directly mentioned the situation around his election of Bret Kawano to the Supreme Court while speaking about the importance of the outlet of the republicarians of the early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on a stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I don't run, but I really fight, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues, “You see these terrible, terrible groups of democracies, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to return their power by using all the resources available to them, you see evil, innocence.
It doesn't matter who they're gonna hurt, when they have to get over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "give up and stop".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "frequency, evil, innocent and dishonest".
He mentioned Senator Diana Fiantin of the Rules of Democrats, set up by the Senate's Court Committee, on behalf of which the public responded to challenges of resignation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'll wait a while – that was a very bad word of the body – the worst word of the body I've ever seen.”
The labists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion do not tolerate
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost not a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the order of members of Parliament of the lab party to which he has been told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, got a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironic similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The statement on the meeting of the Eastern Labour Party of Notingam stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the lab party, the Council's meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of "facing, humble" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever began.
It becomes clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the lab party, and each opinion is challenged whether it is acceptable for the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought we had previously shared a similar political thought began to expect me to change my thinking completely and take attitudes that I would never take, regardless of whether it became a word of national security or of the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I'm saying, there's a critical abuse of social media that calls for trial, rejection of central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I have more happiness than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are usually political.
I have a great deal of concern about professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disheartening aspects of this era in politics is how the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice tolerance culture.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "reliance" or change of election rules, the party becomes more demanding.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud and then "it'll be all right".
But that's not why I came into politics.
Another 32 years ago when I joined the lab party as a student, caused by the concern of the Tacher government that literally left my school to collapse, I fought to improve public services for those who needed it, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in East Notingam could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to tell them is that when the country goes towards Bregzit that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But I have a message that's not about Notingham Momentum, but for my voters, no matter whether they're members of the lab party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how judgely threatened or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will turn me away from sharing in a way that I think is of the best interest to all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrous: Unconquered Air going up
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Air earned the triumph in this wonderful entertainment contest on the day of the Scottish Premier in Ragby.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, they owe everything to their superior defense, as well as to their improved chances of bringing home team up, and trainer Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our competitions so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: "The praise for Air, they better use their chances than us."
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fryer Climo, gave him the advantage of Ear, but the kind card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Voriors, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggot stole an unconverted point.
We long for Air's leadership with a panel, previously, just in the middle of the day, he reached a point, and he turned a point so that he could reach 17 to 5 for Air in the rescue.
But Melrose started well in the second half of the year, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the leadership to five points.
Then there was a long detention due to the serious injury of Ruard Nott, who had been brought to the bearings, and since the beginning, Aar has continued to fight with the point of Stafford McDoual, converted by Climo.
Air's VD captain, Blair Mcferson, then got a letter card and again, Melrose paid for the extra man with an unconverted point at Bruce Colvin's end of time with unwelcome pressure.
But the household team returned and when Straan Hachinson got a round card for air-free air-conditioning, McFerson pulled off the line on the back of Air's sharp attack.
The climate turned, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Rou took David Armstrong's hit and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the team.
Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kiran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it has been found to be appointed as director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis played in the BBC's popular series, on which he is a scenarioist and a long-term partner in comedy, Greg Hemfield.
The second announced that the next nine season would be the last and that Kirnan plans for life after Kregling.
According to official records, he is Director of Apionmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia surrounded with land hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a hidden-bedded marine seat in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up sea blue marks.
The marine bases from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea is ours.
It's our duty to come back."
Through the fall of Bolivia, the mention of the coast lost in favour of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the case with the peninsula to swim back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may now be the biggest in the decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and of course is expected a positive outcome," said Roberto Calsdia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's case which, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to allocate a sovereignty to Bolivia's sea exit.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president with domestic origin, who faces a controversial battle for elections next year, is also quite dependent on the trial on Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he said solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge for Bolivia and that it will not change much even for their benefit.
The UN seating body in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the trial of the international court only comes six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the last four years, maybe they've found Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem with access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric buried Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not had the exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welce, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "the incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and the possibility "to put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsdia also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should go beyond the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament unless it can't trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarmament its nuclear weapons unless it can't trust Washington.
Ray spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the Singapore summit among the rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo was involved in relaunching blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Un.
Rei says it's "fiction" to be considered as continuing US sanctions and sanctions for the declaration of the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing with the non-Pioning Declaration to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country is most likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyonging next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest sellers in your neighborhood
If you want to improve the size of your collection cap or completely block the sun, then don't keep asking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that hid the style set on the fashion week in Paris.
In the end, the unprofessional hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent out their creatures that fall in the eyes of the track.
The party highlighted by Valentino was a huge escape hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that flew over the head of the model.
The other major supplements included lemons, purple hats, and even pineapples, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of silver masks, and it's time for the night of witches.
Many of the colorful masks were painted and painted more on Hannibal Lektor than on high fashion.
One creature appeared on the nursing equipment completely with glasses and nozzles, and the other looked like a standing coral ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the broken hat with two large steps that they all carry from Riana to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult-shaped fashion house behind the very unprofessional hat spread through the social media sent another great creature on the track, a sandbag with a size of almost equal size to the size of the model he drew.
The dark Portuguese ruffy bag, with a red flag and a white leather hand, was the part that was highlighted in the collection La Riviera SS19 of James on the Modal Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitaž told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great beach hats and bags in the store next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the searcher for too many supplements."
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continues in 2018 with another complete exceptional results of the trials, which is only reinforced by individual and group success in the sport, art, music and other community-wide achievements.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scots Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide the best service for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement appropriate school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as a choice in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, that will make him polite.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it will touch him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just get together in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent studies this year, we can see that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher rating of 5+.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a higher "5+" rating in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who also studied Spanish also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages now, as an item of choice, are seen at the same level as STEM objects (study, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programmes of independent schools as well as other places.
The 2014 EC Employment and Skills Commission survey noted that 17 per cent of the workers' failure to fill jobs was due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly responsible to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing demand for languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone will choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such experience.
The ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries will automatically give him the advantage of the polygon before competition.
According to a poll by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults from the EC in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over 10 percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So investing in learning languages is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding substantial employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the language it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the OK when it will be seen in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages from which he can be selected in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be ignored, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the country's future, so this must be transferred to schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"It must be done well" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debate in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is almost over for the fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton said James would play in the first race in the premise on Sunday against Daver Nagets in San Diego.
But the minute I play, it's still not decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Valton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter for the Lakers, Mike Trudel, wrote a tweet saying James is probably gonna play a limited time.
After training from the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-six race before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in front of this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
South Typhoon Channel for Trap's Mitigation in West Virginia
President Donald Trap started a series of myths as part of the campaign, tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five ordered myths of Trump next week, including visits to remote places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation of his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is in peace, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans may lose control of the Congress by voting in November.
How long has Tramp's evening meeting been in West Virginia and how can you watch it over the Internet?
Tramp's meeting in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 Sunday. A time zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's dating in West Virginia over the Internet with live transportation in South Tyub.
This week it is likely that Trump will turn to the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Bret Cawano, who has become more intense because of allegations of sexual misconduct with the expected delay in voting in the Senate for one week while the FBI's investigation takes place.
The primary goal of the myth series is to help the Republicans get a lock on the elections in November .
Since then, President Trump's campaign has said that these five myths next week have been directed towards "incentivising volunteers and supporters because the republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"The control at the congress is so important in its agenda that the president will travel to which more federal states will travel with the start of the campaign season," a spokesman from the Trump campaign for Reuters, who refused to be named.
Written in the West Bank arena in Wiling, tonight's meeting can attract supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania as well as Pittsburgh media", according to the newsmagazine Metro from West Virginia.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trap in West Virginia last month, the country where he won more than 40 per cent points in 2016.
Tripp is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who remains on the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: The US team showed courage in the fight to keep in life the hopes of the beginning of individual matches on Sunday
After three international seasons, the four on Saturday afternoons may have been just what he needed at the Buy Ryder.
The turnout of happiness is a completely designed sport concept, but players really believe in it, and most of such games.
Who would say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have a advantage, of course, leadership from four points and twelve more games.
According to Spit, Americans feel they have a weak wind in the air even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else is then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each achieved three points of four.
The test was great, and she was running with an example.
These strong challenges of celebration became increasingly strong during his game, with a key hit that led to four-four glazing when he and Thomas had two rounds after two rounds.
His attack with which they won the 15th game was over with a similar challenge, telling you that he believes the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to be pregnant and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that each player's left right now.
18 dots to reach the point.
The only players with more points from Spit and Thomas in the last two days are French Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Buyer Ryder.
The strange but beautiful role of Europe is four out of four and they can't go wrong.
"Molovod" was the only couple without bad hits on Saturday morning, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
It series and the way it seems that their energy runs down to this winding group ensures that they are players that will win on a week and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun comes behind Le Golf National, except Flywood or Molinari.
It's preferable both at the same time on different holes.
However, discussions about European glory remain unfair.
Boba Watson and Web Simson quickly got in touch with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he got in touch with Alex Noren.
A broken strike and two of the first nine buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they never could get out of.
In the week, however, there's no one that can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and the four are so fascinating to see from a close perspective because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't listen to, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus made significant leadership in the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight although some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of the World Cup
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Cup Ryder after Sunday's leadership in two couples and fours from 10 to 6 before the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, the attack was taking place with two victories while Tiger Woods was struggling to take the lead to Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bourne's European team, which fought to keep the trophie he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had a lot of misses in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans made more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophie.
Flitwood is the first European beginner who won four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensory weekend, are the second couple who won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cup Ryder.
After "smashing" Woods and Patrick Ridd in two pairs, they played great and won the inspired Woods and American beginner Brayson Deshambu with yet another 57.4.
Woods, who flew through two swords on Saturday, was currently playing great, but now he lost 19 out of 29 games in two pairs and four and seven times a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning doubles, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the four victories of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not find themselves after their pleasant, winding day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-fold Dominant Winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set up a measure for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory 2&1 over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the two pairs and returned later to win Pulter and Rory McClow with 4&3 in four, but lost the initial two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Cup Rayder a certain team has been equipped with a lack of four points in an individual game, although as holders of the title, the Furic team has had enough equal results to maintain the trophie.
After two days, however, the weekly attack seems to remain on them.
North Korea says "There's no way" to disarmament unilaterally without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country can give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual World Body General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, decommissioning nuclear tests structures and committed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Of course, we don't see an appropriate answer from the United States." he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and there will be no way to start unilaterally."
Although Rí repeated known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the approach to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be rewarded for the changes, its statement seemed significant because it refused unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Rei praised Kim Jong Un and Donald Trap at the first meeting of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump gave security assurance to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Piongang must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to release the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament first of all" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and they even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Rei said.
"The perception that the sanctions may not hang on the knee is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Rei didn't mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trap, which the US leader put in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a chaos".
Nevertheless, the tone of Rei's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he said before the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean rockets to the American soil is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "racet" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Tripp, which was threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there was much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "Is it necessary two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the changes.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue completely and without exception until complete, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with a view to preventing the financing of the Pingang nuclear weapons programmes and ballistic missiles.
He met Ray at the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second session.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he was making progress, but he was denied from North Korea only after a few hours because of "gagster demands".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Mun this month for the disarmament of a rocket building, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him "the appropriate measures" he asked for are the security guarantees that Trump gave to Singapore, as well as a move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new course of Harvard University this year is aimed at all diplomats to learn more sleep to fight the growing learning magic culture of remaining awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to primary care for themselves.
Charles Cajzler, professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School's sleep school and female hospital specialist Brigham, has designed a course he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after holding a talk on the impact of inadequate sleep on learning.
"At the end of the transmission a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, never told her about the importance of sleeping--what surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the reasons why good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee cups, cups, pastries and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine in bed.
On the other hand, participants learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart and brain attacks, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the students' behaviour right away.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Cajzler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition modern technology and increased pressure on students means that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, must be "the secret weapon" of a student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even in order to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to pass through the famine regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cajzler design the course after visiting one of his hours last year, in his first year of Harvard.
He said his course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to invite all postgraduates to complete a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Cajzler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "son of light" emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which puts the circus rhythm into problems with sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Golto gathers the people of Gerard
Reingers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's attack sent Stephen Gerard's team's final defeat with 1-0 in Livingstone.
Aybrox team wanted to record its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat of Gerard team in 18 games as manager who left his team with eight points behind the escaped leadership team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time, and Reingers' attitude lost inspiration and opportunities for reconciliation.
Now the Rangers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston climbed to the third and only back to Hibernian according to the difference in his head.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to get medical help because of his head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 in Livingstone who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained attitude pushed opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to arrive at a point, two minutes after the start of Menga's first play, Scott Pittman hit Alan McGregor's head, but the middle line player missed the chance.
Then the attack from Kihan Jacobs' distance came to Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner Alan Litgou could only play open in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos evidently felt he should get a pen within 15 minutes when he and Stephen Lawles were beaten, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two shots at the hunger in the first half of the year, but the former hero of Aybros Liam Kelly was not caught by the attack on Lasana Colibali's head and the weak hit on this Edaria.
Although the beginning of Livingstone's 34th minute may have been opposed during the game, no one can deny that they deserve their game.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' attack.
Scott Alfred didn't respond when Declan Galager added Scott Robinson's ball, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Cubali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly responded from its blockade line.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Haket took a lot of long-term additions.
Holt's team could've extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well set up and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner.
Reingers' replacement, Glen Middleton had another request for a panel after meeting Jacobs, but Tomson didn't approve again.
Almanah: The inventor of the gay numeral
And now one side of our German "On Sunday morning" is September 30, 1882, before 136 years ago today, and we're off to... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the creation of a device known as the gay calculator.
Since then it has become the leading cause of science, the gay figure has become the main cause of popular culture, such as in the 1950's "Clorado's village" film, in which these amazing, Cuban scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans point out:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers says: “It’s a gay number that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the hearings, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans said, "Tell me, it must jump now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" removed cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the infected cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer and then be returned to the organism
The test vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the removed cells, the ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called HER2 and then their return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute for Betezda Cancer, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancer", including blood from the cities, ovariums, white leaves and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to extracting immunological cells from patients and their “learning” way of tergetating cancer cells works in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanje West made pro-Tramp out, wearing a hat with his nose, after he woke up on Saturday night alive.
It didn't go well.
Kanje West was noted in the study during the live show on Saturday evening, after useless performance in which US President Donald Trump thanked him and said he would apply for a job in 2020.
After a third song that night, called the Spirit City, which was wearing a captivating note to make America Praise Again, he began to criticise democracy and reiterate his support for Trump.
"Many times when I'm talking to a lawyer they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd live long from America," he said.
The Saturday, evening show began with a satirical meeting with Matt Damon where Hollywood star was laughing at Bret Kawano's testimony before the Senate's legal committee, related to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the West's back photo was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh at West with the release.
West also apologized to the public that he had hardly gone behind the stage because of his hat.
"They laughed at me behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They laughed at me!
Then they told me I'm in the wrong place, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
West went on: "Do you want to see the underground place?" said he would "get his superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted public disappointment at least twice, and the team at the evening show seemed embarrassed, said Varajeti, a man said to the publisher: "The whole study is taking place."
The news was brought as a replacement at the last moment for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with the performance of the song "I want it," dressed as a Perier bottle.
News received support from TPSAD Conservative Group leader Kendis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: You're blaspheming what you're up against. ”
But the owner of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was "his own and that's absolutely beautiful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he accepts and spreads ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, where he is now "officially known as Caine West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, known as Paf Daddy, Paf and P Didy.
The associate rapper, Snup Dog has the name Snup Lion and of course the famous music legend Prince, changes his name in symbol, and then into the artist's previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after he shot a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihamor, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the public prosecutor.
The star from the Tronov Game series, Kit Harington, attacked toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as an expert fighter like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of Tronov Games.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho hero stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be strong to be respected.
In a statement on the cultural part of Sandy Times, Kit said he believes he's "something's wrong" and asks how to deal with the problem of toxicism in the era of #SegaKajawam.
Kit, who recently married the star of the Tronov Game, Rosie Lesley, also 31, admitted that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we go wrong with men?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male figures.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What do you learn from TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must have a certain aspect of manship?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be involved in the continuation of the Tronov Game when the series would end next summer, saying "he's finished with battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will resume the restoration of the West West of Sam Shepard, which is a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he was thinking of what his wife, Rose, had met is the best thing she'd ever done since Tronov's game.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played the game, a man who had a love attraction to Kit's face, John Snow, in the fantastic series that Amy won the prize.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% drop in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only on the second quarter of 2018.
The larger number of new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
Each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT's people is great.
Because of the country's conservation values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Walters denies the data from a staff member associated with the Republican party's senator as "hazardous lies" and "terrorist theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles was convinced that the claims of "ultra-right" sympathizers and web locations.
"Ladies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly includes home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Yuta.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday, announced by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel held hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct against Bret Kawano, appointed as a Supreme Court judge.
The information presented appeared shortly after Kavano was questioned by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redsteit have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the publication is linked to Walters' office and information about Walters' staff has been published, Hil said.
"These unfortunate charges are completely false and represent an absolute lie," Voters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information that has been made.
The unfortunate charges are completely false and absolutely false."
Voters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Flejcher.
"These denials are nervous," Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that she has no time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't get angry.
He can't be challenged.
He can't ask himself about the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Flecher seemed to compare Walters' reaction to the criticisms of the democratics associated with the Cawano judge, who was charged with critics because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was asked to replace Walters in the mid-term elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Voters said her office reported "the appropriate institutions and police for false claims.
"We will allow criminals to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The idea of Johnny Inglesh Attacking Again - buried the Spanish lies of Rowan Atkinson
Now it's traditional to look for elements of Bregzit in each new British-related film, which seems to be important for this revision of the French of the fake, Asian Comedy Johnny Inglesh - which started in 2003 with Johnny Inglesch and reborn in 2011 with Johnny Inglesch: reborn.
Will careful self - denial about how obvious we are for no reason be the new export option that the nation has?
Even so, the face with big eyes and many glamours on the uncomprehensible Johnny Inglesh got a license to "stop" things on a second time - his name first means that he is a comical creature with a wide coverage made for filmers in places where English is not spoken.
He's certainly a shadow of a secret agent who, despite his sincere efforts to watch the gllamor after a little bit on Cluzo, has pictures of Mr. Bin and part of the boy who played a note from the Song of Cochie on the fire from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
Its foundation is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who has ever introduced Barclis's forgotten TV commercial, leaving him mad.
There's one or two minutes in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked it when Johnny Inglesh approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armory, and the wheels of the rotor hit on his shoulder.
Atkinson's donations for a physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and the Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor looks like it's meant for children, instead of for adults, and for me Johnny Ingleish's setbacks aren't as innovative and focused as you don't have things like Bin atkinson.
The whole issue is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has infiltrated the top secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identity of all British field agents, disappointed by the agent who is in office - a frustrating little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a brave and combative figure and already suffering from the total warming of political instability: Emma Thompson is giving himself this kind of quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario with which it would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling it Johnny Ingleish himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "in black" gives hours for secret agents: there are several good guys here when England offers a school for spying that's on rock Academy.
English is a quick call to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-operation Bou, who played Ben Miller.
Bou is now married, in connection with a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicky Peperdin is not well-used.
Well, Betman and Robin, to ruin everything in the King's Secret Service are returning to action and they're lucky to see the beautiful Ophelia Buletova, an actor from Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: evil Jason Walta, a Jack Lacey-led actor.
English and Bow start their obsession with absurd actions: they're turned into French restaurants; they're making a vacation after they're on the luxury yacht of Walt; and English starts right anarchy when they're trying to use a case for virtual reality to get to know the interior of Walt's house.
All the bikes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and kind, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice weighted things.
And like other films with Johnny Inglesh, I can't think of it: can't the British film industry give him the role of Rowan Atkinson who will use his talent?
The labists refuse to cover the British plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's lab party will think about a radical plan for which British will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants corporate bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give them another day off for workers.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "conforms" with the party's economic agenda and the country's plans to be forced by workers.
The past four-day work week is supported by the syndicates' Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A high-ranking party member said of Sandy Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen during the night, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The lab party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party was charged with a four-day working week during the parliamentary elections campaigns in 2017.
However, the aspirin has not been accepted by the entire lab party.
The Labour Party's spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party's strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow officer John McDonal used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "manless directors" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get back the whole part because the Labour Government could make "deductions" due to non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and to create inclusive property funds, with 10 per cent of private companies' capital going to belong to employees, which will be able to take an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy makes a statement for "60 Minutes" to see if the FBI's investigation to Cavano can reconsider them.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kawano has postponed the final vote for his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least one week and has updated the question of whether the Bureau's openings may suggest that some Republican senators withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them think.
Kennedy was opened up by his South Carolina bike.
"I think it's clear," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges went out and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unbiblical."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a heavy stone.
"My decision has been made for Bret Kawano and there is a shocking charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret denied energy," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blaise Ford.
"All she calls them couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is represented by the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event on which famous stars stand and have an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big grasslands in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephone call or any other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Civil Service been because the rest of the 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of free concert really a way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an internet petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed that more than 19 million "activities" have been registered by supporters, which have been working for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped world leaders to identify commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 pledges and announcements resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the total funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Food Power, the partnership of investors and investors, with a seat in Britain dedicated to "helping children to use their potential", which promises to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help the country's poor food after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens alike, we can make social injustice of malnutrition, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Food Power said, before the assembled people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were transferred to calls for improved food for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Food Power, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
How do you answer one of the frequently asked questions on their web site "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
From Global Citizens, they replied: “That will be a long and hard way — we will never succeed.
But, like the great civil and anti-partite movements in front of us, we'll succeed, because we're strong together.
Janet Jackson, Wikend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Daniel Mona are some of the artists who will be present at this year's event in New York, whose host will be Deborah-Li Furnes and Hou Jackman.
America can use the Navy to block Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki, quoted by Washington Ezeminer.
According to Zinki, Russia's participation in Syria - the name where it acts at the request of a legitimate government - is prepared to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that maritime roads will remain open and if it is necessary to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki has been approached by the event organized by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the input and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking about Russia as "an unacceptable ponie" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after the Trup administration launched a mission to encourage the export of liquid natural gas into Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much simpler option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the tramp administration, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Tek 2 gas project, which, according to Trap, has become a "prison" in Moscow by Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Tek 2, worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for carrying out pressure and that customers should be able to choose supplements," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude was opposed by Germany, which confirmed its dedication to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to take part in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, the first person of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to apply for president in 2020, Senator of Masachusec said
Senator of Masachusec, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully consider" whether she would apply for a president after the mid-election of the mandate.
At a meeting in the city congregation in Holíok, Masachusec, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of making a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our non-functional government, which means a woman of the man," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to apply for president."
Warren assessed the work of President Donald Tramp at a meeting in the city congregation and said he "led the state in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to her criticisms about Trump and the man he's nominated as a judge in Supreme Court, Bret Cawano.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, an poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her election unit do not think it should be candidate in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Masachusec said that the senator should not apply for a candidate, according to a study by the University's Political Research Centre in Safolk/Bostonski Globe.
Thirty-two per cent support such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, while 38 per cent support potential nominations, and 48 per cent against.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party that was discussed for nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byiden said he'd officially decide by January, according to Assoyed Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about the Trek Paylin's terror syndrome at Donald Trapmp's dating
Track Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his arrival in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"With my son passing through what goes on after he comes back, I know how other families are feeling out of fear syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she said before the interviewing audience for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin called the arrest "slon in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming back a little different, they are coming back firmly, they are coming back and asking if there is any respect for what they and their airship friends have for, and each other member of the army has given it to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman's face, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, police spokesman in Vasila.
18 United States and Washington Supports Opposition to New Asylum Policy
Eighty-eight United States and Washington support opposition to the new US policy that prevents the giving of asylum to victims fleeing from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington City filed a petition to the court on Friday in Washington as support of an asylum seeker who is anti-political, En-Bi-Si News reported.
The whole name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Parliament, which the American Union of Civil Liberties imposed on him in August against federal policy, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang", abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The State Defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applications are due in the United States, such as countries with persistent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reverses the 2014 Board's decision on immigration complaints which allowed undocumented immigrants who run away from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The City's public lawyer Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of bringing laws at the level of the United States, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and this provision violates the principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter claim that the policy preventing immigrants' entry is harmful to the American economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the required labour force".
Public prosecutor Jeff Sesns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing home abuse and gang violence in June.
"There are asylums for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sesns said when he presented the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people all over the world face every day.
Disaster relief efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she was carrying her male baby to the evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes and pick out their items so that they can save anything they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients injured by earthquakes with 7.5 magnitudes were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has back and back cramps, stayed in front of the War hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Solsie found it in his eyes when he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room of the fifth cat in which he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was pressed in the walls of the wall, so I think," Harris said to Assoyed Press, adding that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
“ I heard my wife asking for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "malturing" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a statement to four parties in an American daily listing the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Tramp spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's payroll in De Moin Register - the most selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of joining the US elections for the November 6th Congress, China rejected the charge.
Tramp's charge that Beijing is trying to get involved in the US elections marked by US services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escaling campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that simulates import tariffs with each other.
China's fiscal tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed to exports from the United States such as Iowa, which support the republican party of Trump, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and a former, long-term governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a column in De Moin Register's weekly edition, "now doubles the abuse with propaganda ads in our free press."
"Before the propaganda's demining, China's government misuses its negated American tradition of free speech and free media with advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper store, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of thoughts and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have about China's problem economy, because the media are controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer for publication" on the column, although he did not say what a newspaper is talking about.
Republicans are away from women's voices before the mid-elections of the mandate, because of the Kawano debate, warn analysts
Since many Republicans do not observe or defend Bret Kawano's nomination in the Supreme Court and despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative effects, especially from women in the previous elections to the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no return," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Sirakuza University, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said it is doubtful that the pressure to investigate the FBI of Senator Jeff Fleick (Republic of Arizona) will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive movementOn group on Friday, before Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November is coming!" in a protest at the Senate hall, when the Republicans, who have control over the legal issues commission, decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano and despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaissie Ford, Mick said.
"Enthusiastism and motivation for democracy will be high," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participative political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the pre-school and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not liked the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate were presented in detail, analysts suggest that there may be negative effects if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Still, former president of the National Committee of the Republican last week, according to News of En-Bi-Si.
"It's not only about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kawano will go to the hearing, it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they dealt with it," said Guy Sesil, a US Prime Minister, a group that helps in the election of democracy, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided around whom they can trust after Ford and Cavano's testimony, although there are more people who accept the first side.
A new Ju-Gov survey shows that 41 per cent of the researchers are definitely or are likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they are definitely or are likely to believe in Kawano.
In addition, 38 percent said they were thinking that Kawano was probably or definitely lying when witnessing, while only 30 percent thought of Ford.
After Felix's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other, at Debora Ramirez's, general Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's legal committee, under oath last week that Kawano had been attacked by a drunk state when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez charges that the Supreme Court’s court prosecutor showed the genitals at a party while they were studying Jill in the 1980 ’ s.
The World Network’s inventor is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lie, the inventor of the World Network starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the platform with an open source of Solid, Berners-Lie.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that the purpose of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the moment of history."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "data store" or short POD.
It can include lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Autoluk, Slek and Spotify all available to one viewer at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data storage of the Internet is that only the user depends on access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to executive director of company John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lie, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project work contract and a community of coordinators.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available to Inrapt's web site.
Berners-Lie said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they're making a complete change where their business models are completely turned away by night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet on the basis of the World Consortium of the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lie has been an influential speaker in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Institute for Open Data.
"I am a great optimist for the new Internet era," added Berners-Lie.
Bernard Van: A well - known carrier of the Victorian Cross from World War I
The only priest of the Church of England who received the Victorian Cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, honest Bernard Van, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengles and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never knew he had the highest military power.
A comedian stone was discovered by his two paramedics in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it's a "immortal symbol" that the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather got the painting.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de San Quentin "With a very thick fog and under a powerful fire from bullets and meteors".
He later ran to the place where he was shot, and with the “great courage ” he went ahead, before he attacked a bullet nest and disabled three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I know I will never be able to do, but it's something that doesn't make him humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a wedding after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brandwood.
Michael Van said "it's a great honor that's part of the parade" and added "the courage of true hero is shown by the support that many people will give."
The fans of combined combat skills remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead they got Pepa Prasse
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have a chance to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown all night in Britain on Channel 5.
On the 6th of the morning, just as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, British observers were shocked when the channel was transferred to Pepa Prasse.
Some have not been impressed since they were awake to the early hours of the battle.
One of Twitter fans described the transfer of a child cartoon file as "some sick joke".
"The law is such that on 6 a.m. it was inappropriate and had to be transferred to a child programme," said Dave Schwarz, Belator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked for the transfer.
"Pep asks," yes.
Company president Belator Scott Cooker said they will work on a schedule that will include future observers from Britain.
"I think that when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution," Kukker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning each week and we won't be able to find a solution on the week after our time, and on the Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when we moved, and no one was kind.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you he won't come back.
We're going to limit the number of five battles, instead of the number six -- as we usually do -- we've tried to communicate more because of fans and we've been overloaded.
It's an accident.
Disks on the island: Tom Daily felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daily says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand everything until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking at the first radio 4 free-site discs, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give them "a hope" to others.
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular president of the long-standing Kirsty Yang show took a few months' rest because of the disease.
Speaking as a comparative figure in Lavern's first program, Daily said he felt "lower" than anyone else while he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of low value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that everyone would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olympic with two bronze medals has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used its approach to this year's Communist Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly and want to give others a “hope. ”
The three-fold World Championship said about the love in American filmmaker Dustin Lens Black, who met him in 2013 - "I'm surprised".
Daily concluded a marriage with the disfellowshipped man, who was 20 years old, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much early" -- he went to the first Olympic at 14 years of age, and his father died three years later from cancer -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depth.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dieley, and Dale said "all his views" were changed.
"As long as you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are important things from the gold medal of Olympiada.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son named Robert, who died in 2011, was 40 years old after his brain cancer.
He said that his father would not accept one of the last things he asked them if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to be in the first line," he said.
"I held my hand when she stopped breathing and when she actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized it was inevitable," he said.
The following year, Dali competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of for my whole life - to jump before home audiences of Olympic games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of the song - pride of Hader Smol, which he had turned to in his head in preparations for the Olympics and which he still enjoyed.
The discs on the island of Bi-Bi-Si Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, when he wasn't in shape, he was at the club during the World Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will record on Sunday when he's playing the 47th Cup Ryder competition, but he'll have to change his shape to avoid an unfortunate coup.
Mikelson, who played the white event, recorded 12 times, was sent to Captain Jim Furic's club during the Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the fifth winner, he devoted time to renew and practice his game, on the scale, with the hope that he will correct what he has cleansed.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the heavy Le Golf National playground, where the remote bears hit regular punishment in ignorance.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikelson, in the ninth contest on Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win in all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lack four points before 12 individual matches begin to be difficult, Mikelson's game may be judged.
Furic expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been part of the famous and has been given a lot for these teams in the past week and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought more, but that's what happened, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Mikelson's record of Nick Faldo's most-played contests at the Cup Rayder on Sunday.
It could be the end of the career in the Buy Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven semi-finals, although Furic said his presence was carrying something unmaterial in the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastious, experienced, he wants to laugh with people and he's a great man at the team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Tomas Bjorn, the European Captain, from experience, knows that significant leadership in front of individual competitions on the last day of the Cup Rayder can easily turn into an inequitable position.
The Danes argued at a competition in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but "they only crossed the line of purpose with the bearings," with a minimum of 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Valderama; we had great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a while," Bion said, after he watched the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 on Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play as you need to.
This isn't over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy and focus on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposition country - the best players in the world."
He added: “I don’t want to give early evaluations on this issue.
It's a different star.
The next day, we are expected to play individual games, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all abilities are tested as a golf player.
That's the message you need to send to the players, give up tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving the partner and he's supposed to give it all away."
Unlike Bion, opponent Jim Furic will ask players to play better individual than they did in two, except Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Forric himself was at the end of the last day's change, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, joined the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it carries a lot of pressure on middle sports.
We're putting the line properly and the team's order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Tomas has been assigned the task of resisting first and facing Rory McClery the most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important part of the series.
"I decided to act this way with the guys because I think we're gonna cover it all," Bion said about the election in individual games.
The new German warship has been resounded
The latest flag of the German Navy should have been sent in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but that will not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and growth prices, local media reported.
The release of the Reynland-Falz, the leading ship from the new class of Freden-Vietmberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Cate, calling for the military's passport.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the issues after the message prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Vietmberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old brakes of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful ball, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and marine rockets, as well as some steel technology, such as a small radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among the other important features is the sequence of maintenance - it should be possible, the latest franchises, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, persistent delays mean that modern warships - which should allow Germany to have power over the oceans - will be old as they enter the ministry, notes Di Cate.
The F125 strike came to the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos in Hamburg.
That was the first time the mariner would return the ship to the pilot after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quote a large number of key "software and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless when sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Vietmberg's ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of old frigates from Bremen's class.
It also emerged that the ship is heavily over the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the mariner to add future upgrades.
"Rainland-Faltz" weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice the weight of ships from a similar class that used Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problem hardware, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the team - also became a problem.
It is said that it reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the start of €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest fleets are particularly important because of warnings of Germany’s reduced sea force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "takes ships that can be distributed".
The representative said the problem got worse over time, because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fractals in Baden-Vietberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Lilac's Secret Life
A new study of property is being carried out in the Scottish mountains to discover how lilaces use the border in the search for food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of the unique air currents and will help in conducting future protection activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and suprano-lilies, as well as the coffee lilies with long ears and doubenton lilaces in Inveroo Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around property to track ligaments' activities during the season.
N-Ech-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of sound from all photos will determine the frequency depending on the type of lilac.
Then a map will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior on the border.
Rob Devar, Nature Protection Advisor in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will discover which areas of life are most important for the lilacs and how each species uses them.
Such information will help determine the benefits of living management, such as the creation of libations and how best to maintain forests for ligaments and other related species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects the bed and the loss of habitats.
The windmills and the lights also pose a risk as well as the sticky funnels and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The lilies aren't really blind.
However, because of their hunting habits, their ears are affected by the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and crossings in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the lilacs very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, law inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve for lovers in Scotland of the property of Triv in Dhamfris and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for lilys," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good habitats.
But there are many things we don't know about the lilacs, so the work we do here and on other property will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He points out that it is important to check whether there are lilaces before refurbishment of property can occur because the sudden destruction of the bed can destroy up to 400 women and young people, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilacs are protected and are unlawful to kill themselves, rape them, or disturb them or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish official in the Lilian Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about ligaments and other kinds of things, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected the charges of rape, and the lawyers will charge the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo called the accusations of rape "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will complain of the German magazine Der Spigel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus is accused of strengthening the US, named Catherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid $375,000 not to talk about the incident, reports Der Spigel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33 rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought today is false news," said the fifth gold ball winner in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for remembering my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and he's good" added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to complain about the charges they have called "unauthorized transfer of doubts from private life," says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player will seek damage because of "the moral damage to a sum corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident involving the charges occurred in June 2009 at a hotel and Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her personally, according to the documents submitted to the court in Clarke district of Nevada.
Majorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99%" "good boy", but he dropped under that "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documents, they had sex, but there was agreement.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an agreement without a trial because she was afraid of revenge and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he wants to change the deal now because he has trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join the real Madrid from Manchester, U.S.A. when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Yuventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Brittany: Britain "will Always Grieve" that lost car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if it lost the status of a world leader in car production after Bregzit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "frequency" what Toyota-British announced to Bi-Bi-Si that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We don't need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the impact of border conditions in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Aventis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Kuk, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how the EU would operate cross-border trade without agreement, including Honda, Bem-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-EM-You for example says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics synergy in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "real time" system, where the works arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be an interruption to the border which industry considers can cause delays and shortcomings in shares.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory in the Derbishshire factory, the company announced, and the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for future EU relations is "just designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We need to have the best deal that will enable us not only the success we'll enjoy right now, but to seize this opportunity," he said for today's Bi-Bi-Si Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we must be able to continue what is very successful seven logistics syndicates."
It could not say how long the production would have been banned, but it long warned that additional costs would reduce the company's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years as a union representative at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, as soon as these jobs are taken off, they will never come back.
According to one government spokesman, "We have set up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Tramp's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed by the White House announcements
Donald Trap's important meeting with deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "debt for another week" because it continues the fight against Bret Kawano's nomination for a trial in the Supreme Court, White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between the supporters of Trap and Russia and the potential violation of the president's laws.
Whether Trump will release the deputy public rights defender and thereby threaten Miller's independence, spurring discussions in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of leaving.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tripp said "I wouldn't like" to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an attack on the hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee in which he witnessed and Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Kristin Blaissie Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Cavano, which would further postpone the vote in the Senate.
Trump Sara Sanders' press secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet fixed, it could be held this week, and it could also be postponed for another week in view of all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things work out and I'm always trying to get the press properly informed."
Some journalists argue that Sanders has no support for press briefings in the White House on September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings were not due to the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trap and the media would increase.
"The president organises more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving evidence: "We have considered those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "If the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time in the last few weeks, and the talks with the US president will replace the briefings for the journalists."
Trap regularly answers questions when it comes out of the White House or when it participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting high officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes uncontrollable appearance before the congregation journalists.
EU workers' letter to the Secretary for Health in Scotland's national health system in relation to fear related to Bregzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system, expressing their appreciation for the country and their desire to stay after Bregzit.
Jin Freeman, a MP in the Scottish Parliament sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of resolved application for EU citizens working in low-level public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of bringing about the expected decisions this summer.
However, the United Kingdom government has also intensified its preparations for the possibility of non-aggression.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU-wide share widely precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
Cristion Abercrombie, the lawnbecker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, the main trainer of Tennessee State, told reporters that the damage happened just before the half-time.
"He came to the side line of the playground and just jumped on the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground and then put it in the containers and carried it to further evaluation.
An official representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the nature/level of the damage" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecrombie is a student in the second year and plays her first season in red dress in Tennessee State after Ilinois transfer.
He made a total of five interviews on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 interviews this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize Corbin's success in attracting young voters
The high administrative tax will be the home of those who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds per year, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will now declare that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters with their promises that it will provide access to housing and focus on people with high-income.
The higher administrative fee will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while additional funds will strengthen the Government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount which despite the current administrative tax includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second house and the purchase of property with a view to renting the same could reach up to three per cent.
The ministry is expecting this move to meet up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built assets in London have been purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which has led to increased prices and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to become involved in this purchasing process of housing property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "citys of spirits" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high prices of property holding the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs. May to change the quotas for affordable homes to correct "the embarrassing situation of home" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms in the home, including controls of the old age and ending settlements without justified reason.
He also wants advice to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "I said last year that I would devote my ministry to returning to the British dream, with life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our corrupt home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is wrong for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same way as British residents.
The dream of owning its own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to run with Scotland."
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become manager of Scotland's national club.
Scotlandnman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently on the third place in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after he returned "St. Mirren" to the Scottish Prime Minister's league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got B cap and that was it," Ross said about the Scottish Sports Sound at BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and always pulled me back.
However, I could only get this opportunity if I'm successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross's predecessors as the manager of "Sunderland" are Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Godardice, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kin, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he felt no frustration knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is estimated by "Can I get this club back to the Prime Minister League?"
In view of the structure and objects in this club, he is undoubtedly a member of the League's Prime Minister," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which career he entered after working as a assistant to the head of Dumbarton and after a 15-month commitment as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped "Alloa" to strengthen the fall into the third league and brought St. Mirren back from the loss of the title in the First season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played "Clyde", "Hartpool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"That was probably a true church for me," he recalls at the reception of "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as a manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounded strange because it was good for me to go, I earned enough of it, and I enjoyed certain high - rankings.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I'm still going through some stress and stress, but I just feel good about the manager's role.
I always wanted to be a manager and now I do, in this role I feel more comfortable since I've been in my entire adult life."

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer’s heat wave has resulted in an increase in the profits of the British popes, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but an increasing pressure on restaurant syndicates.
The figures show that the pubs and bars noted an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profit of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from CGA for business advisory services in determining these figures said: "The sun's time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June when the benefit of the popes increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants significantly decreased.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has further deteriorated during July.
The pubs and bars in which drinkers are mainly sold noticed much greater growth compared with the previous years in contrast with the restaurants where there was noticeable decline.
The popes in which food was sold mainly were also badly affected by the sun’s seasons, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out on a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and food sales by only three per cent.
Paul Neuman, a vacation analyst and hospitality from the RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and influence of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to the sale of the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly noticeable as a supplement to the current pressures that create costs.
The long summer couldn't have come in a worse time for local owners where food is mainly sold and time will show whether the increased temperatures we had in August would provide much needed breathing."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stand in the publication of new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device to monitor sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operating groups with combined income from over 9 billion pounds and represents a determined reper for industry.
One out of five children has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents.
One study showed that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents and teachers
A survey involving 20,000 secondary schools showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
The news heightens fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a "main" profile that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a summary of the website Instagram where photographs are shared.
The news increased the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" profile that they show to their parents, and then they have other private profiles.
One mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found the same teenager who asked others "to strengthen it."
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters'' and Head Mistakes' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
Chief of HMC said: "It's really frustrating that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics committee
Elid Doyle was elected as an executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most talented athlete in Scotland and President Jan Biti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained during the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community has great respect for Elid and we are sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly if she became a member of the committee," Biti said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help in the right direction of the sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 and 400 metres of the Games in Atlanta in 1996, despite the winning four gold medals of the Olympic Games, and which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after a transitional chemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month later I received a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I'm going to hold on or to what extent.
The whole process was mackerel, but I managed to keep it up completely, I could go back and practice as an ambulance!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An announcement about a building bomb where mothers are compared to cows cause division of the mind of the Internet
A construction pump company creates a division of Internet ideas when it publishes ad where mothers come in line with cow's prayers.
To note the launch of a product for which it is said to be "the world's largest construction pump," user-oriented technology company Elvie published a funny advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump has given to mothers that are coming.
Four moms dance in a chair for cows full of snow on a song that sounds like, "Yes, I am begging for milk, but you don't see an egg" and "If you didn't notice these are no fruits, these are my gardens."
It goes on to say, "Puppy, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, feed the cities."
However, ad that was published on Facebook by the company caused online controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, where many said it titled "the horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just as we should be pregnant and born to be able to produce milk, except the fact that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they are born," one of the commentators said.
Elvie's wall pump is discreetly included in the bring-in plant ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment puts it this way: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a bomb for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "It's really inappropriate advertising."
Others, however, defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "a joke."
"I think this idea is great.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still brought it.
The cold made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's true.
It becomes a word for a generic product," said one of the commentators.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertising for mothers who milk their milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like "crowds."
This isn't a declaration that falls or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while the discrepancy pumps were stuck in their buildings.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use breast milk pumps feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, there are no wires, no pipes, and discreetly included in the bring-on building, allowing women to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while they milk the milk.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a really revolutionary product and deserves courage and motivation.
By setting up a parallel between women who milk and milk cows, we wanted milk milk with the help of a pump and the challenges it carries in the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump to be present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved into a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in prison has increased significantly, although the crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the fact that strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have delayed children's placement in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they were asked to be sponsors of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and royal officer, testified before the Congress last week that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without membership.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested had no previous criminal record.
" Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally resident in the country and most of them are foreign with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to persecute these individuals," Mr. Albens said.
With the aim of treating children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within a month after being arrested, not within 60 days, as the hospital staff say the previous standard was voted.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, rather than personally, in order to present their case for a legal status before the immigration court.
Those who are deemed to be incorrigible for obtaining relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in prison, the more likely they will become frustrated and depressed, which may lead to violent falls or attempts to escape, workers in hospitals and reports that have appeared from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger objects like Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely to be ignored signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children into the city without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or get along with their friends can increase the traumas most of them already face.
Syria told Americans, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulalem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also played the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces illegally existed in the territory of Syria, claiming that they were participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would act accordingly."
"They must immediately withdraw and that without setting conditions," he said before the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people lost their lives since 2011, and millions were displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurd forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Barar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country's territory destroyed by the war.
In connection with the refugee issue, Mualem said conditions are good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politifying the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The US and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a Tampon zone in the last large rebel station in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey treaty has prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the contract has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including Nusa Front fighters associated with Al Qaeda, which "will be eliminated."
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that soon he will bring the first meetings of the new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition with a view to preparing a future constitution for Syria and opening up the path to the elections.
Mualam laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution", and warned of the consequences of the continued interference in the same.
Why Trap's gonna win a second mission
According to that logic, Mr. Tramp will again win the 2020 elections unless his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted by impeachment and scandal, which is most likely and hoped for by the Liberals.
What will no doubt be "the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of delay in the viewers.
Since 2014, the hit-time rating has increased more than twice and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" on average has 2.4 million viewers at the time of the hit, which is 1.7 million more than the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of "MSNBC" has reached the top cable rating of about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is being posted.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Nil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survivor" drama "ABC" for the secretary of the cabinet who becomes the president after Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran in writing comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a bus in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her she'd vote for Mr. Tramp.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," said Mrs. Skuel.
There's also a certain fun value in the entire chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
The exclusion of all of this is luxury which only privileged viewers can afford.
However, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been looking at a panel of experts that debate the use of the "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a 15,000-dollar Paul Manafort" (the "Washington Post" clothing) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomical anomaly by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching real show is that every night he wears something new to you," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Wellhouse Entertainment and creator of Pown Stars for the Rotary Team at the Trap show and daily conversions (canons with NFL, thanks to Kim Yong-un).
You can't let yourself miss any episode because then you won't be able to replace it.
When I visited Mr. Fleis this week was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Hawaii, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while he was filming "CNN".
He could not stop looking, at least not when Bret Kawano had to face the Senate's Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some joke, but it turned out they were right."

Flow of external resources in the toughest mid-term elections in the High House race
It is not surprising that the 17th convention area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of the convention areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently rebuilt building area in Pittsburgh, Democratic Conor Lamb was candidated, which took place in another area of the foreign elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th Congress area and who is largely opposed to the new 17th Congress.
The maps have been changed since the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas are manipulated for the benefit of the republicans, which is contrary to the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress Area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns between the party's main sponsors, the Congressary Committee for Campaigns of the Democratic Party (DCCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns of the Republican Party (NCRC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the foreign elections for the 18th convention area in Pennsylvania held in March, which characterized a wide media coverage.
More than a decade this place was occupied by a republican, and President Donald Tramp won the area in a 20-point difference.
Political experts are giving little advantage to democracies.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then rejected it
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama while the partners did not expel the Tramp's management team.
The State Department's officials decided to withdraw US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heder Nawert, the State Department's spokesman in his statement early this month.
However, only with regard to El Salvador were convicted, which received US assistance from around $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high rates of unemployment and murder in the same way.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity aimed at maintaining a similar assembly last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level administrative representatives stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to every thought about El Salvador's punishment.
Vice-President Mike Pens should call on the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration assigns to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the release of a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on possible abuse of justice by Mr. Tramp, for which there are very strong evidence in public records at the moment.
Mr. Miller also claims to point out his investigation to the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaigns are related to Russia in her attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Tramp will have to bear responsibility in that body as it is prepared to appear before the voters again, and perhaps even before the gate composed by his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties here and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, not even his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to take a state attack on Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed out on the opportunity to avoid the following years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such changes.
What will we do if Mr. Tramp gave up on Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot table after this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly filming the president and speculated that he was inappropriate for the function he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How do we react if Bret Kawano's new investigation is called upon by the F.B.I. or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court and despite the credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote on the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Tramp will be charged?
If we fall into all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that's not gonna happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on the table with swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers with an optimistic attitude to the rapid Vienna conflict
Rangers are host to the Rapid Vienna match on Thursday, and they are aware that after the game won against Villareal in Spain this month's victory over the Austrians will confirm their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-order player for damage to the knee was prevented from appearing in the entire season until the unsolved 2-2 game with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a drop-down board for larger achievements.
"That was a good point for us because "Villareal" is a good opponent," said the 31st-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
We might have given a little more at the end, but the unexpected result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the world, and we gave each other all of us in the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, we are waiting for another big European night.
I hope we'll win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they've had a good outcome in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
The past year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that had happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor in the area.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and succeed."
Women can't sleep tonight because of this fear related to pension savings
Although the researchers had a clear view of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their spouses about the long term costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to talk about it," says Holly Snaider, vice president of the Nationwide Animal Insurance Company.
Here's where you got to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day if you do not share your wishes with them.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get it because such choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term policy, a hybrid animal insurance policy, which may help you to cover your expenses or to ensure your own financial security if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take full care of your health care so that you can fill your face with confidence to monitor your medical care and to ensure that health professionals respect your wishes unless you are able to communicate.
Think, too, about your financial resources.
In this way they would choose people from trust to make financial decisions in your name and pay your bills unless you are able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about drugs and its allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asks.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man shot more than once with an air gun in Ilfracomb
The man was shot more than once as he returned home from leaving.
A 40 - year - old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb when he was shot in the cities, in the stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "the act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call on the Witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of severe earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials announced, with the expected number of victims rising.
As a result of the interruption of communications, aid cannot be obtained from the Dongala district, a region north of Palu which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Several key facts for Paul and Dongala, on the island of Slavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of a river on the west coast of the island of Solavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala represents an area covering more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Slavesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Province Central Solavesi, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
The management of Niel is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite border of Slavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
tsunamis also struck and hit the western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and regularly strikes earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Achech in northern Sumatra caused tsunamis which hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Achech.
2005: Under heavy earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, and then nearly 700 people died.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the Isles of Mantawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed tens of villages and then killed about 300 people.
2016: The land with flat focus hit the area of Pidi Jaya in Achech, causing waste and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, where more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for Vice President Sara Palin was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, involvement in a family violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a woman in charge tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took the phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su prison facility with an opportunity to go out if he pays a 500-dollar sum, KTUU said.
On Saturday he appeared to a court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when they asked him how to explain himself before the court, they said from the network.
Palin is facing three A-class infringements, which means he can be sentenced to a prison sentence for up to one year and a US$ 250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a B-class breach, sentenced to one day in prison and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with his father's attack, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before Alyaska's Veteran Court is underway.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assaults, interference with the report on the crime of domestic violence and possession of arms under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he'd probably hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the Veteran groups in 2016, after she said her son's violent behavior stems from PTSN, as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Slavèsi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees causes tsunamis and destruction of thousands of homes.
Electric energy and communications networks have been interrupted, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Solavesi, which is northeastern of Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta.
Social media circling the video on which the time of the hit is shown.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York where eight persons were killed, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 October, reportedly used the rental truck of Home Depot to launch a road attack on the West Side highway down Manhattan and to cross the pedestrians and passengers on the way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims "intendedly" and "intended" committed serious physical injuries, according to a report on the intention of seeking a death penalty issued in New York's South Circuit.
According to the judicial documents, there is a possibility of a death penalty and on both of these grounds of the prosecutor's act.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal large port charged Saipov on 22 basis, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of recruitment, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, there was a need for "detail planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, where the way Saipov did the same described it as "dangerous, harsh and
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov causes, damage, damage and loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Daren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the death penalty was imposed in New York’s South Occupy.
The defendant, Kalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were murdered after being sentenced to a sentence of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show up in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police reported he told his followers that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also reported that he asked to put the sign of ISIS in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent of all 22 charges.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they're "extremely disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, rather than to accept a confession of guilt and to express a life imprisonment without an opportunity to release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in it," Paton said.
Saipov's defense earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
A member of the "Tori" party says NAJEL FARAZ should be owed for the talks on Bragzit
Nigel Faraj today during a protest at the "Tori" party party party promises to "mobilize the people's army".
Former leader of the party "Ukip" said politicians must "feel the heat" from the Eurosceptics, while one of Teresa May's MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon of the Burmingham march said the United Kingdom would still be "out of the EU" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary of Bregzit.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs May with regard to the merger of her deeply divided members was stressed by the members of the "Tori" party who joined in a special protest against Brigzit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementing the Czechs plan despite the attacks on Pro-Bregzit face, against-Bregzit face and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force Eurosceptics and the members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said to the Pro-Bregzit Leave Means Leave in Solikhal that he wanted to "reject the plan from Chekers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would still be outside the EU," he said.
The MP from Velingbarrow added: "I'll support Bregzit, but we must reject the plans of the Chekers."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world’s war to be defeated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is quite wrong."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the "Tori" and Pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Czechs plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe us our victory in the elections.
Please give up the Shakespeare plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The presidents keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj of the meeting said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to give up the decision that was made at the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bregit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get out of it."
In a letter to the air - conditioned crowd, he added: “I want you to do our political class, which is about to hand over Bregzit, to feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win in Bregit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-regular and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, anti-Bregzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting at the city center.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists came up this weekend carrying banners with the title "Torivists Against Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete façade.
There's nothing called a good Braggsit," he added.
Warren is planning to think carefully about the president's candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "he will think well of the presidential candidate" after the elections in November.
"Boston Globe" said that the Democratic Party's representative from Massachusetts spoke about his future during the city council in West Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a respected critic of President Donald Tramp, will apply for the re-elections in November against the Republican party's national representative Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of the campaign of Trap in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with the voters after Trump came to the presidential function, with which maintenance uses the form of a city council.
One of the audience asked her if she was planning to apply for a president.
Warren replied that it is time for "the women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, which includes setting up a woman at the top."
Suspected of the shooting case and the death of basketball Sims by the LSU team
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect of shooting and the death of cosmopolitan Wade Sims of the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced Deton Simpson's arrest, 20, at the press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the picture.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the South University campus early Friday morning.
"Widd Sims had a gun wound in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said about the media on Saturday, "247sports".
Wade was involved in protecting his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was present at the crime scene, owned weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to the police station in Paris East Baton Rouge.
As a junior high 192 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 matches with 10 matches last season, in average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran Prie of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since the time that Walter Botas was qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mercedes team orders will play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on a chair while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his player.
The Vatel first entered the box and let Hamilton fight the move at the end of the group, something that had to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came back behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one of one that forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the inside of his free risk to remain on the side of the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended at seven.
Then he drove in most of the race and directed his car’s tires to get to the finish and reach Kimmy Raikonen, taking the fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but he couldn't increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came to the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter's done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has made a really unique decision to have her two in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad speech of the body.
President Donald Tramp laughed Senator Diana Fianstein at the meeting on Saturday about her insistation that she did not publish Christine Blasie Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kawano of sexual assault.
In his speech to the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not direct attention to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "wicked and dishonest and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's going on in the Senate in the last few days you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and uncaring," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diana Fianstein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
To Fianstein, a letter was sent about the charges against Kawano by Ford still in July, and they were published in early September, but Fianstein denied that information leaking came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't publish her story," Fianstein said before the committee, "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them in trust and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented about the same meeting on the Sabbath: “I’m going to tell you something, it was really bad about the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democracy use the instructions to achieve its own goals.
"They are determined to return power in any way.
You can see their evil, subtly, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who's gonna have to get their power back and control," the president said as media says.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer reached two goals for Giants at the Dundee Competition
Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the competition under the elite league on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 race in Denmark on Saturday.
Giants were given the advantage of two holes that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilleer reached.
Mike Salivan and Jordan Kouni have been privileged to return the Giant's leadership to the house before Dwyer.
French Busher equals Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to ensure their victory with his two eyes.
This was the third time in the season under the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over "Dundee" 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, where Giants won the previous three games.
Chance for Twoer came in the fourth minute, about 3:35 by adding Kendal McFol, whose addition was secured by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Salivan provided home leadership by 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Kauni to achieve the outcome 15:16.
The couple took care of Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for dinner at the end of the first period.
The host is regrouped and Bushard returns them with a strong game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nilsen for the first time to provide Dundee's leadership in the competition later in the second period and he ensured his team's victory in half of the last period of the fifth race .
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next game on Friday on domestic territory in Milton Cans.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape from earthquakes
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after his death by helping hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a great earthquake hit the island of Slavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong sequences continue to leave the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues avoided saving their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower of Mutira Cis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which had been delayed.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321 which was then on the track would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, announced the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him in the morning before the helicopter came to Paul.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Siggi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the urine, until many can't even access," the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Branches that reached as many as 15 feet [6 m] left Paul behind, where a mass funeral would take place every week.
Wars and commercial planes carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother said about Sky News: "The quick help carries the body every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimum marks are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said about CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man disappeared after the plane landed in the cabin
The airline operating with the plane that landed in the Pacific in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, after saying that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that tunnels.
Air Niugini said they couldn't find the man's passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local rocks helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuck Island airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven persons were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
The causes of accidents, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane had been hit by a lien near the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had missed the track.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's an absolutely good job," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to pass through the water that reached them up to half their way to the exits for emergency cases on the plane that tunneled.
He said the Stuarts were panicking and screaming, as well as he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mariners working near the port’s reconstruction also contributed to the rescue, while using a reconnaissance ship they transferred people to the coast before the plane landed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The data from the air safety network show that 111 people died in an accident to airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but not one of them was included in Air Niugini.
An analyst established a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The charge ended with a presentation of the case on Saturday for the man's retrial, which was charged that a woman in Mississippi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, has been witnessing for hours as an expert in the field of research analysis.
He noted for the story that he used phone records to connect the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rovelet said he got data on the location from several mobile phones that show that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, "The Clarion Ledger".
When his cell phone was shown on the basis of the data, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another setback was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Telephone records show that they knew only one week.
Rovelet said some time after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information on his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Haley.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is that hip-hop compound?
Hip-hop trio wants to kill the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in his music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hops are away from their origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate his conscious hip hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their life through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black one?!
A sister from New York complains about a couple because she was fired after sending a "rastic" message
A sister from New York complained to a married couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she had received a message from the mother who complained that she was "one more black."
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the case is actually "injurious."
Linsy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of new negotiator Giselle Morris found out she was black.
"There's no way to get one of them," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a letter addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
Once she realized that she had actually done Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "unsuitable" abandoned Mrs. Morris, saying that their beloved aunt, who is an African-American, had done her job badly and that instead she expected her aunt to be from the Philippines, she announced "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for the first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris accuses the couple and seeks compensation for the damage of 350 US dollars a day in export for six months, a commitment that would include her living with the family, what was originally committed, but without the conclusion of a contract.
"I want to show them that such things shouldn't be done," she said for "Post" on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges that they were racist, saying that Ms. Morris' resignation was a reasonable step because they feared they could no longer believe her after they hurt her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think about.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for "Post."
"But would you trust your children in the face of what you were rude, even when you were wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the case is "injurious," Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very good," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemns the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers fear readers will not be able to connect with a sword that speaks, found in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, stated in connection with the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the great success of Padington.
After she said that her father who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before receiving inspiration to write the book of a small player in the form of a sword, it would be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't even want to say goodbye," she said.
"But since he felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child that achieved something in life: and you're proud of him even though success doesn't owe you yourself.
I think Padington's success was that way.
Although it was a word of creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always attributed his benefits to Padington's own.
My daughter was on a deadbed and I had to meet her on the phone.
Her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors desperately tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that he will not survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"So Nad called to tell me she'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Thai, I really love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications given to her doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased and she was coming out of her system.
She died early, and this meant that all her systems were giving up.
I just had to sit and wait, aware that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay here."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperez lamenting the loss of her daughter flying on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“ I pointed out my head, and the tears didn’t stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an immeasurable feeling about Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris put cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers on which people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infected smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because it was "in a really dark place."
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler after he took his life in 2014.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis develops the cards "for others to let them know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it becomes a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Hamfries, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark who was married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, so he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of the day of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, and he didn't even look at them and made no contact with them."
She said that his death is a tragedy for all of them, but they must find a way to escape it: “This kind of thing disturbs the family.
We're broken.
But we have to keep going and fight."

Bret Kawano's future is uncertain since the FBI started the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something on what he was asking for, i.e. a limited time investigation, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unit," said Mr. Flick on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "disappears" under the inherently neutral state.
Why did Kawano and his supporters from the Republican party not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their mobility is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held for only a few weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to face a failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to be elected as a member of the highest court in the country.
George V. Bush calls to the senators, and he's been lobbying to support Mr. Kawano who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, however, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI announces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kawano could receive at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice-President Mike Pens to change the uncondemned outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "falls" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea decreased after Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Bjeong-Seugg, citing data from the South Korean Union Union Ministry, said last year there were 1.127 crossings at the border compared to 2011 when there were 2.706.
Mr. Park said the strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates of people's neighborhoods are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving state status in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can easily pass in comparison with the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriates them into force.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still in war, have significantly improved over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues that focused on the standing of the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Young's in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed on the United States for slowing down from then to now.
"As long as there is no trust in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot at first unify ourselves," Mr. Rei said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cawano "historic" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kawano "historic" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but think that if a woman acted in that way, they would say she was "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Cavano's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the allegations that Dr. Christine Blassie Ford was sexually attacked when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very excited at his introduction, sometimes even crying and missing while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned democracies in the committee, calling them "grotescious and coordinated destruction of his role" organised by Liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Cavano's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he is afraid of democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to remove Kawano from office if the allegations against him are confirmed and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not only qualified to serve in the Supreme Court, but he's not even eligible to serve in the court where he's at the moment," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is concerned about possible tribunals that would bring Cawano against the Act of Access to Health Care or Roye against Wade, because he is considered to be a subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his application, Kawano did not answer the questions as to whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, scared man to enter the court and wait for us to say, "It's really beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't release without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who has played a role in my life has helped me a lot, and she has told me that she too cried when she is angry, but she has managed to develop her own technique, so when she gets angry and starts to cry, she tells her face what she is talking about, ” she says, “You may think I’m sorry for crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's great."
The salts are allowed as a long ventilator for anger partly because they are, in effect, mismanaged.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs at the office where men dominated me was when I once started to cry with unexplained anger and an older woman, a cold manager from which I always had some fear, grabbed me for the door and pulled me off the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Shreder was a democratic congressman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a ship's foreign affairs called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schreder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not think about the idea of being a candidate for the president.
"That wasn't a good idea," she told me 30 years later through the laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Sunned and Seven Jugins."
Given the long-term start of the campaign, she didn't have enough financial resources, so she promised she wouldn't get into the race without raising $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters gave her men $1,000, which would only give her $250.
"Do they think I need a break?" she asked.
During the speech in which she said she would not start a formal campaign she was so dominated by emotions, i.e. thanks to the people who supported her, frustrated by the system that it was so difficult to collect funds and tergetize voters, rather than delegates and anger against sexism, she began to cry.
"To see me you'd probably think I have a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schreder recalls how the media reacted to the case.
"You'd think "Clinex" was my corporate sponsor.
I remember being asked to write on my grave plate.
"He's crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the US-China trade war was shocking and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between the countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Tramp, US president gave the first warning of the beginning of this year by paying off key exports to China, including solar panels, chalic and aluminium.
The situation has significantly increased during this week by introducing new US$200 billion goods tariffs, which effectively accounted for half of the goods coming from the United States of America.
Beijing was returning to nature every time, about five to ten percent of US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China promises to return to the United States on an equal footing, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon give up.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship before the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, US trade war pressures can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because it will reduce the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that with a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created to start a sudden decline from any economic aspect in which the countries are much more dangerous than was previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grays, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a tink-tunk.
Syria's "prepared" for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is prepared for voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help restore the country which has been abandoned by the long war that lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulalem said conditions in the country improved.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas left by terrorists in order to restore the state to normal.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country where they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures have been affected by their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mulalem said the Syrian regime welcomed assistance in the restoration of the country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional help from lands sponsored by the rebellion.
Europe has won a significant victory on the Ryder Buy in Paris
The European team won the US team on Ryder's turn in 2018 with a final result of 16.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six times in the European field and the name of the Ryder purchase has not been won in Europe since 1993.
Europe has returned the receipt since Danish Captain Thomas Bourne's team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who was facing difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first punch hit the ball in the water at par-3 on the 16th floor, lost from Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was featured throughout the circle, which became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 results after the tournament started to be organised in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost the score of 5:4 from the lowest ranked European team player, Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranking player, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, which may have been the last time he played on the Ryder buy.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garsija, a participant in eight Ryder purchases, became the European who won the most prize in the tournament with 25.5 points won during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I'm happy I could help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's now taking his place at his cousin John Ram, which one of one of the week won Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with result 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now he has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder shop.
It's about amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 big titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had been trying to direct the game to low-wood fields, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the entire tournament.
American team captain Jim Furic after his team's disappointment game said "I'm proud of these guys, they're really fighting.
One morning we put him on a team from Europe.
We fought.
Get down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our radar committee and we're going to continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit them.
We were robbed.
