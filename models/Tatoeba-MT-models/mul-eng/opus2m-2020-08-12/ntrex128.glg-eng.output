Members of the Gales Assembly are concerned about " taking them for Moniques"
Consistency among some of the members of the Assembly, currently known as AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name by the MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate was under way by plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all the panorama are afraid to be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried that the new name "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who didn't know Greek, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the set of the group "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A Galician conservator said his group kept an open mind about the change of name, but he noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in French is pronounced similar to the English word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Committee on Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course the final decision on any descriptive decision of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Gales Government Act 2017 gave the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which strongly supported the name of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the Commission preferred members of the Gales or WMP, but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on changes in weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the operation of the Assembly, such as the rules of incapacity of AMs and the design of the Committee's system.
AMs will get the final vote on how they should be called when they debate the reading.
Macedonians come to Urans by referring to the change in country name
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has been with neighboring Greece for decades, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens took a long time to insist that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO accession.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who was opposed to the change of name in the lobby, said he would make an immediate case for the vote.
However, the rapporteur's defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep quiet while Harlem's churches are still fighting
"The elders I talked to said there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing nor another."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of being from the neighborhoods where people usually go."
As for the churches, I'm afraid the money from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders wait, and "before or after they'll be back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments with apartments with communities of owners of the type of persons who would not help to keep the bars from being holy.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Reverencing John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott into the shops of Street 125, a commercial street of Harlem that resisted contracting and climbing into black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the very damaged building, but as Father Johnson's carpenters made plans to rebuild it, they carried the carillon.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the trailer as "the fields of the poor."
The expert who played the violin called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it by the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who take care of St. Martin during the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parroquial union, the body which is opposed to the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in diocese, expressing its concern that this last "expects the costs" to the council, although it did not participate in the contraction of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frescoes complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A tiger will hunt a boy while fishing salmon in California
The police reported that a tiger attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while doing submarine fishing in search of nests in California on the first day of that cruise.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was about half an hour walking with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with the calls, when he was born with a group of people to help get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an emotion to fish a nest, but then he realized that he was calling me "They're after me!
They hired me!'
Hammel said he found out when the boy got there.
"Call me all the world out of the water: 'There's a tiger in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter at the child hospital Rady in San Diego, where he is entering critical state.
The type of tuberculosis responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they would divide a tiger into the area a few weeks ago, but that they would decide it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage on the top of the tower.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, at Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of tigers in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury's plan to enter the United Kingdom beauty market
Saninsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the great warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable entry into the United Kingdom beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow while sales in fashion and products for cooking are falling, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then they will pass on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the stalls they occupied on their day televisions, microwaves and fashion products.
Sanisbury's stated that he would double his offer of beauty products until reaching 3,000 products, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sanisbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online purchases and a change that translates into buying small quantities of food daily in small shops mean that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Saninsbury's, said that establishments will always look more like shopping centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discounts such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sanisbury's already introduced sales points of Argos and Habitat in hundreds of shops, since he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Saninsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but association reached its end after a debate on how to share drug revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sanisbury's sale of its pharmaceutical business formed by 281 shops in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds commented that he would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sanisbury's, said: "We transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that can be reached to ask for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adjust to all the attractive and practical needs and locations that mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "heavy" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, went "frust" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million-dollar business with his life-style brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his house clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon's star, Peter Jones pushing chips while withdrawing from his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "heavy" when the gold girl on television admitted during a tent meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to dedicate her to the brand of home clothing and accessories, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, went to Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took a plane to Great Britain and headed to one of his vacation residences.
One source said: "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be your long-term future in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left attunants to all the people involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened this morning, so close to the launch.
There was a store full of goods in Marlow's offices to sell."
Experts believe that this morning's departure from the most profitable stars in Great Britain could cost you your company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products that come from kitchens and candies and clothing and textiles to put it on, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friend with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples go together for holidays and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be converted into the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative in the ITV I'm Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business matters."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He welcomed the criticisms that he would receive from the media by making a comment that some would consider "a few of the president's own" and by being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much?
Trump said by putting his voice out of "televisionist."
"There's nothing left."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump sees as a great step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization were halted.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, which the North does not see the "responsive response" by the United States of America to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his mitin speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"Let's go to war with North Korea.
They'd have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve Kim's relationship had positive results: ending with tests with missiles, helping to free the hostages and making the rest of the U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his insulating strategy by talking about Kim's relationships.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people on foot here," Trump said, signaling to the crowd that had just gone ahead.
A tsunami and tsunami destroy an Indonesian island leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national disaster had been declared, which is an essential condition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have left it very clear that they have not asked for international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children are gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, Vice-President of the National Disaster Management Agency, made sure that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their assistance.
Given the earthquake that sustains Indonesia constantly, the country is very badly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although refuges for tsunamis were built in Aceh, they are not usually found on other sides.
Although an alert is issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was highlighted in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake will travel to Palu, but it will be at least three days later to arrive at the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo's electoral campaign turned around the improvement of damaged infrastructures in Indonesia, and contributed money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds in the final right of the next year's reelection.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative way of living by faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other handguns.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of empathity in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a victory in the Premier League before Chelsea with a bullet at 89 o'clock on the Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri still at about 27 metres from Chelsea port with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the balloon with his left leg before he fired a shot at the second peace.
The balloon survived the area while moving towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball just fell on a Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and went into the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball in front of as much as possible, so I tried to win the best possible time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and from a touch without thinking too much and I'll just disappear."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored at 25 minutes.
The Azuis front passed the talent ball to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before turning around from the middle of the change and entering the Liverpool field..
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the camp.
He made a beautiful passage deep in depth leading Hazard towards the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up in the second peace marking with a gun with a sword that Alison Becker had not been able to stop.
Liverpool is facing Naples in the season of groups of the Champions League on Wednesday at the San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will do its own videoton at UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of Indonesia tsunamis rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to a report by the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped between the roofs of the buildings that came down with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press release, the voice of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by debris from destroyed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman dies.
A murder investigation opened after she found the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds in John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old suspect of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to come or hear something about this step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I would like to make a call to contact us any who would be in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask you to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the mission room that comes into contact with us, as they could have key information for our investigation'.
A policeman confirmed that the found body belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This evening, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police are in the process of informing the most close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him they didn't allow anyone to come in or out of the building.
The man remained speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents just knew they wouldn't be able to walk in for hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying on stage.
Not to say ‘it's horrible.’
At 2 p.m. there were two police wagons inside the cordon with another train just outside.
Several officers remain within the cordon watching the block of apartments.
To all who have information, you are asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, which calls 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously on the phone number 0800 555 111 citing the 247 log of 30 September.
The statute of Cromwell of Parliament became the last monument affected by the struggle by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for its destruction of many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatic and puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and "try to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of the states that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Westminster Palace would become objective.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they had sacrificed Cromwell mistakenly by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as Parliament's defence against external pressure, in this case, of course, was addressed by the monarchy.
Whether or not a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the middle conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
A killer pig hunts a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwestern part of China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the appellant, "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-off artery and blood cover close to a cutle in the market in Liupanshui , in the province of Guizhou .
A porcine hunter was prepared to put the vaccines to pigs in the castle on 30 May and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He seemed to travel with his cousin from Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another suitable cut.
He said there was a big man with blood on his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, about 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and wet," said the first, calling "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. of the caves to give him food to his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told the Evening News that the pig was closed to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although they are not very common, there are already cases of pigs that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig caught a Gale farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and threatened the animal.
After an Oregón farmer was destroyed by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not tend to be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "smoker.
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa prison will bring strong and generalised rains to the west of the U.S.
The projections indicate that Rosa's fur is weakened as it passes the cold waters from the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and west of the United States during the next days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, east time, Rosa was a Category 1 runner with winds more than 135 km/h and was located some 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected Rosa to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valgata begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa reaches the low California peninsula on the moon as a tropical storm, she will start pushing tropical moisture north, which will enter the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico or the moon.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with valgada will create abundant and generalised rains in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitation between 25 and 100 l/m2 will result in dangerous sudden floods, floods and the possibility of land extinction in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitations that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially on large parts of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden floods with deterioration conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rain could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and the electric currents would bring local winds and dust.
Valgada will bring locally strong rains to the southern coast of California.
The total precipitations could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could at the same time cause a stream of smaller holes and narrow roads.
These would be the first rain from the wet station in the region.
Spreaded tropical rain will begin to reach Arizona at the last hours of the Sunday and the first of the month, before the rain is over at the end of the moon and Tuesday.
There will be plenty of rain coming to Four Corners in the morning, which will last until the winter.
October will be witness to large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although tropicals will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to re-appear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C] from the south to the north.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher than the average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial in Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the Supreme Court appointed by Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual aggression that had reportedly taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last hour of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out an investigation of a week of duties.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that it's 100 percent safe that Kavanaugh made her play when she was drunk and that she tried to get her clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported coming that over 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other lines that forwarded it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have problems measuring people who see TV from offices.
To make an idea, it's an audience similar to a football end or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of the TV show.
After a statement was made by the moderate Republican office indicating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS were arrested by CNN and CBS cameras in the morning and supported by demonstrators when he tried to enter a road elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with the look down for several minutes while he was recovered, TV live on the CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many innocent women."
Flake said that his office made a statement, Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more than say in the committee hearing.
All television and cable lines were transmitted directly after the Judicial Committee had to vote in order to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh before the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said it would only be if the FBI investigated the allegations against the one named next week, which included a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations held with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused critics of "play politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused who criticised his plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Great Britain and to promote national interest.
The first Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview at the front of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Great Britain and the EU should record the tariffs on the other side was "completely absurd".
Wade Sims murdered: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect to carry out the shootings that ended at the life of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU Balont player (State University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second grade murder charge.
The officers released the video from the front line between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose his hands during the fight.
The police recovered the tapes from the scene and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, as reported by the CBS affiliated channel WAFB.
After asking Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the gunman who killed Wade.
The defense reported that he had been sentenced to 350,000 US dollars.
The East Baton Rouge parish office issued a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the unit of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police are with the neighbors for their help in obtaining the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for their "justice and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2,01-year-old was born in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the ball player for the LSU.
Its average of the past period was 5.6 points and 2.6 reboots.
The next morning, LSU's ballistic coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "cut" and "moving" by Wayne's falsification.
"This is what worries us all the time," said Wade.
Volcano green rose on Mexico City
The ashes that flowed from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised the Mexicans to leave the volcano after their crater activity was detected and 183 gas and gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of strangers and horrors.
The images of social networks showed fine-grain layers in the suburbs of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysics detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres west of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Facing between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the police with anti-disturbation and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the Catalan secession.
A group of masked proseparatists with police antidisturbing eggs and paint in which they created dark clouds in the streets that tend to be hit by tourists.
There were also refrigerators later that same day with the police, which used the brakes to cover the laundry.
For several hours, self-dependence groups that sang "I'm not forgotten or sorry" were faced by the demonstrators of the Union who shouted "Larga life in Spain".
Forty people had to be treated for mild injuries received in the protest, according to local press.
The tension continues to flourish in the independent region one year after the reference to October 1st held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted in a way that was inferior to independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession voted.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the electoral table throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night in the spring to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration was also produced but they were forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independent demonstration with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope of reaching Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I came to my parents to cry joyfully when I was able to vote, but now we are accustomed," he commented.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, although it decided, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catholic stand-alone parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in a self-imposed exile or held in wait for trial by their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration in support of his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by both gang politicians.
"There's more tension every time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to report the repression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's bullet gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston is to win
The climber Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerard to his second victory in 18 matches as an Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was to get Gary Holt's team up one level after the Hibernian, second position.
Gerard's team continues to walk out of the house this year in Premiership and next Sunday they meet the leader, Hearts, who separate them from eight points.
But before the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League the wolves.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be involved in division by the sixth consecutive party; the main coach, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller or me.
Livingston lets you escape opportunities from weakened visitors
Holt's team must have made progress long before they were marked, because with its control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-fire didn't cross the border of the portal; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out pushed by Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the portal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play before them, aware that they could put the visitors at risk in the football games stopped.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a shot at what Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined their efforts to fix Menga, which hit the balloon and marked from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but encountered an impeccable defence that prevented him from working very hard at Liam Kelly's store.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
The Ranger guard, Allan McGregor, stopped by a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow threw the ball out in another game of Livingston's stopped balloon.
Many crossings were made in the Livingston area that were constantly questioned, while two petitions were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry into Glenn Middleton's substitute.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
An action and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
¿ E' unanimity, they were excellent and they continue to overcome expectations in their ascending trajectory.
Your game style and players have only changed since you returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt in the way you pushed the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, somehow directed a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them any breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerarrd's orders, they did not reach that level on this occasion.
The last step was failed. You were only able to enter the host team once. Any warning call for Rangers, which is found in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Colonia
On Saturday, 29 September there were blue tears and blue skies during the meeting of Turkish and German leaders to breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last anniversary of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to establish relations between NATO allies.
There are many issues, including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Next, Erdogan directed the colony to open up a new giant mix.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police argued security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The debt of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor called hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist crashing in a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was found in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transverse street from Deptford, in the west of the city, about 10:15 hours (hour of summer in Great Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man fell into the act.
The accident will be produced months after another cyclist dies in an accident running in Children Street a little over a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The metropolis police showed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street blocks and bus stops and they're advised by motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are injured in the disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in an altercated high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at HMP Long Lartin of Worcestershire about 09:30 hours (hour of summer in Great Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Return" unit of specialized officers came to handle the disturbances, involving eight prisoners who are contained in a palace.
Officials received attention for mild injuries on their faces.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "The prison staff was particularly trained to face an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have no doubt that the officers will be delivered to the police and they could spend more time between churches."
HMP Long Lartin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he knew that the director of the prison centre had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disturbants officers had to go to prison to calm down a revolution in which the person was arrested with billiard balls.
The Rosa storm threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane goes through the South-West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for the moon and March of West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, western California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will be passing directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that she will arrive at the last hour of the moon with rain.
Phoenix National Weather Service indicated in a post on Twitter that "only ten tropical cycles will maintain the state of depression or tropical storms on a 320-km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread across a radius of 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Weather Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 150l/m2 on the Mogollón Bordo de Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Gran Conca, could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with possible total islets of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, because the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. dry monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dryness, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, Rosa will play ground on the low California island of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that it will hit the ground in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at night of the moon.
It could be very intense in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitations are expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from the Netherlands of California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico in the form of tropical storm before arriving at Arizona's border the first hour of March as a tropical depression and will then continue up through Arizona and enter the South of Utah the last night of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of it is the strong precipitations in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the South-West Desert of the U.S."
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden floods and floods in the deserts, and land extinctions in mountain areas.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrests by attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white weapons wounds.
The adolescent was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, the Saturday around 04:00 (hour of summer in Great Britain).
She was taken to the hospital, where she remains stable.
According to Somerset's police, during the night three boys were arrested in Radstock area of 17, 18 and 20 years respectively.
Officials asked for any collaboration that had a recording on the event's cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered from the amnesty and cholera of the Democratic Party'
"The vote by Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the neglected and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a mythin in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "was suffering from the amnesty and cholera" of the Democratic Party during its entire process of appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress the yöves, where he had categorically and emotionally charged Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually adjudicated decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in court on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "Americans" were witnesses of the brightness, quality and bravery of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our times with an imputable public service history," said the crowd of admirers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the results of the Republican elections.
"There are five weeks for some of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't do it, but really if I do it," he said.
"That's why I'm going all the way fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is "to oppose and block."
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, as indicated by an assistant to the CNN of the Republican Party.
Indonesia's seismo and thunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them were dragged by giant waves that broke the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gather to attend a festival on the beach of Palu's locality when waves of up to six meters broke into the ground at the luscofus, taking away the lives of many and destroying everything on its way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"In the past, when he threatened, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB in a prison in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, dragged cars, trucks, houses, pulled everything it found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami would cross the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs distributed by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, retreated bridges and broken bridges and a water-consuming mix.
The Replica continued to scuttle the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge wind current was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the very end of a long and narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "cantis" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals and hotels would come down.
Some victims found themselves trapped under the roofs of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, a zone called Doghea and that is closer to the epicenter of the sysim.
The communications were "completely paralyzed and there's no information" from Donghaa, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," he reported to Cruz Redella in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticised on Saturday because it had not been informed of the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves were coming at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a loved one shared in social networks, you can hear a man who is at the last floor of a building crying spontaneously by warning of the arrival of a tsunami to people on the street.
In the matter of minutes the water shocks against drinking in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the writing authentication immediately.
The seismo and tsunami caused an important shutdown which caused the court of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities state that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Yacarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo has planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The proportion of Indonesian tsunami victims exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the course that World Vision staff traveled to get to the city of Palu, where the employees were looking for shelters of lead raised on the floor of their office, they saw scenes of total destruction, commented Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when groups began the unpleasant task of carrying out assistance in the event of disaster, some complained that they were preventing him from traveling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international assistance, but that time has not yet come."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of the neighbors, relatives and friends of the missing were stuck in hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that allayed the depressive argument of natural disasters."
Saturday they took a kid out of a basement.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who took two days under the shoulders with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, trainer of the Indonesian parapenter national team, trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which concluded early this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandji added that some of the people arrested at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel were students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the parapet field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told me how, in the hours following the release of the news of the breaking up of the Roa Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages haven't been delivered," he added.
robban $26,750 while reloading a newport on the Levee
Tomorrow morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharged for a ticket in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport's police department.
In the press note, official researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car would empty a box in the 8:00 complex and prepared to deliver more money.

According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, contact the Newport police by calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Rape changed its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changed the name by Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "O being first known as Kanye West."
Some time ago West, 41 years old, is known as Ye's album, which he used as title of his eight album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who has canceled his assistance by "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'ti', you will say that same year while talking to a Big Boy radio player from your disc.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that exists in us, the evil, the confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rappies who changed the name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old West co-laborator, JAY-Z, also called himself by putting and removing the script and using the majors.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised not to use military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a repressive blood against students arrived.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco's time that "he wouldn't use the military to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration at the time killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly assistance to young people who are studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to IA investors and professionals Kai-Fu Lee, used by Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S.A., it should double the amount it invests in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even though the U.S. lacked formal IA. strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan or the previous year: it intends to be number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the research budget in IA would be a good start, as the other countries are much behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next major progress in IA," said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances of the next IA achievement in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese companies of IA: Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won American Othello player with greater score and later was executive in Microsoft Research from the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic Network of the Advanced Defence Research Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next viewers.
In the United States, researchers tend to have to work hard to get government bags, says Lee.
"China is not taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to motivate its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in December 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established an Artificial Intelligence Centre which is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House has announced the formation of the selected Artificial Information Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
Unlike the NSF, it currently invested more than $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the United States legislation which sought to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in reference to the change in the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday, referring to whether they wanted to change their name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block requests for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has seen its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents claimed that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the outcome would end at least 50 per cent of the necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the reference paper was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Defenders of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or the NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have today voted for the future of the country, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said they would see the outcome of the vote and would make it final.
The new change would require a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The State Elections Commission stated that no irregularity would be recorded at 1 p.m..
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I voted for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko recorded their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country which would open the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scenario and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for whom the referendum was to be held.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our high head and not through the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can join other countries such as China and Russia and enter into the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says accession to NATO will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, the figure below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people interviewed were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote yes.
In order for the reference to be valid, the result must be 50 per cent more than one vote.
A failure in the reference would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro West Government since it came to power in May than in the past.
See: Sergio Aguro, a player from Manchester City, through all the defense of Brighton and finished marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported the defense of Brighton with 2-0 of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Ageiro made it look ridiculously easy to mark the goal of the minute 65.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green camels.
A defense was challenged before crossing several more on the coast of Brighton.
Next, the ball passed to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the balloon to Aguero, which hit the bridgeyard of Brighton Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right of the network.
"Agero is going through some problems on his feet," said the teacher of the City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about 55 or 60 minutes to play.
And that was when it happened.
We were lucky to mark it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blue cells the initial advantage in front of the Premier League.
That bullet came at 29 o'clock.
Aguru received the balloon at the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the corner on the right side of Leroy Sane.
Sane gave me several touches before leading Sterling to the opposite position.
The blue cells put the ball on the door before leaving the field.
The City will face Hopeneheim in the group of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to open his party to Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a competitive Scherzer is always waiting to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which take advantage of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies have ensured at least a common position with 5-2 victory over the Nationals coming in the night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
"Even though we haven't played anything, at least we can play the game knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but they seem to point out that Scherzer is what is going on in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be his starting number 34, made another Bullpen session for the youth and will probably launch the Sunday on his usual rest day.
The right of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Spring and morning in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks for some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't, but really if I do it and that's why I'm going to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "Have you seen this terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on now.
And they're determined to recover power using any necessary means, evil, and ambiguity.
They don't care who do harm, above whom they have to pass to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and impede."
"And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, qualifying to the democracies of "announced, vain, ignorant and lying."
He numbered the Senate's judicial committee by citing Senator Diane Feinstein on the name, who received strong public appeals.
"Do you remember your answer?
Filtered the document?
Mm-hmm. Come on, huh?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is not so open anymore.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I wasn't surprised too much.
After all, I'm the last of a series of working Members that we're not well received, and all to say to our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he faced a decision on anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, where appropriate, issues on which Jeremy spoke to previous leaders.
The report for the Working Meeting of Nottingham East indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years I took as a working member, the Committee's evening meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and generous" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that the labor party does not tolerate different opinions and is concerned if all opinions are acceptable to the leader of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when colleagues who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be withdrawn and adopted positions with whom I would never agree, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact of a little like what it says, there is a horrible abortion and attacks on social networks by censoring the central policy, saying that it shouldn't be on the Laborist party.
And I don't care about myself.
In fact, I know they're more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have addressed to me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of the partners who face a torrent of gender or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is how the levels of abuse have been standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each "untrusted" movement or any change in the selection rules, the party becomes closer to you.
Over the last few years, I have received much advice that motivates me to keep my head covered, not so frank and that then "it would be all right for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 in school, led by the neglect of Thatcher's government that literally let down my school, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and I do not agree with the current direction of the party.
To those who promoted the movement of the guests, the only thing I would tell you is that while the country goes towards a Brexit that will affect our neighborhoods, businesses and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy asking my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud of the services and I promise that no threat or political convention will discourage me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invitation Ayr puts on his head
It is possible that the last two attempts will slightly change the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this threat from Tenent's Premier League.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only invital team of ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk, that he took the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our party and we've followed inquisitions, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You have to admit that Ayr has taken better chances than us."
The trial at the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, took place in front of Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, awarded for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk about the numbers and Jason Baggot launched a wrong launch.
Climate has increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, turned a bullet into a solo, leaving Marker 17-5 for Ayr in favor of rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury suffered by Ruarahh Knott, who left the field in Padiola and, since the beginning, Ayr advanced more through a trial by Stafford McDowell, transformed by Climo.
Captain Dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took part in having another player with Bruce Colvine's test that didn't consume, at the end of a very stressful period.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card to pick up the climate when he didn't have the balloon, McPjherson marked a trial from the penal line on the back of Ayr's mule.
Climo marked, as did almost since the renaissance, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the local team's fifth test.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after finding out that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The second announced that the next nine times would be final, and it seems that Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Aposymorn Limited.
The actor agreed to comment, although a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kiernan wanted to become involved in Glasgow's "progressed restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': inner Bolivia expects the court to take the way to the Pacific
The mariners were watching a covered seam in La Paz.
Public buildings are where a blue flag is.
Ship bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are attached to the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to get it back."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coast lost before Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources continues to live, just as the hope of re-shipping the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at its highest point in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and seriousness and of course she expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX judgment on giant screens across the country with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will be pronounced in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession to Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia, who is faced with a politic battle for the next year's reelection, also has much to do with the moon's judgment.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that there would be no change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to assist Chilean territory, and it has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", says the Chilean expert at international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have brought her back.
"The topic of access to the sea takes a lot of time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' mellow rhetoric has lost the good will that he had left in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries took no exchanges of embassies since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusual decision.
Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end up to 139 years of mutual benefit dispute.
Calzadilla also assumed that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be produced unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong, declares that his nation will not go to nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment was made at a time when the U.S. State Secretary, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be the point of relaunching the nuclear diplomacy suspended for more than three decades after the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "an utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War can be doubled to the North.
In Washington he refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalised scepticism that Pyongyang speaks seriously about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant shadows that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of shadows or if you really want to close the whole of the sun, don't look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the passerale a series of accessories for their spring- Summer 2019 collection that they were wearing to the public with the most pure style of the Paris Week of fashion.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers removed their most surprising creations.
The main part of Valentino was an overcrowded white hat decorated with a low width imitating feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were wrapped sandals, a hat of magic and even a pen, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their cuts and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high design.
One of the creations looked like a complete merculoskeletal team, with gloves and tube, and another one with a cut-off chain.
And if they do it in the way of greatness, it's lucky.
The fashionable understandings predicted that giant gorillas could reach the tents.
The disproportionate shadows come right after the "Bomba", the ball shadow with a depth of less than 60 cm that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the impossible shadow that invades all the social networks has taken another great creature into it: a beach bag of pallet almost as large as the model started with a bath suit that carries it.
The orange Rafia bag decorated with raffi fleets and finished with a white horse ash, was the prominent piece of the spring collection summer 2019 by Jacquemus' La Riviera in the Paris fashion Week.
The famous stylelist Luke Armitage said to the FC: 'I hope the big shadows and beach bags arrive at the store next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools hold a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community materials.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their signs in English), are trying to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools have the goal of preparing their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a plan of studies to measure, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, that gets him to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent studies this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table and with higher approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of the students who studied foreign languages gained a surplus.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that meet SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained an honor matrix in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an excess.
This shows that private Scottish schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are taking the same view as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and in all kinds of ways.
A survey carried out by the Commission for Employment and Training in the United Kingdom in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs are able to cover vacations.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly needed to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages vary according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classical modern languages, while others are derived from languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in the face of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Private schools in Scotland specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to develop, whatever their future.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages are still vital to the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Book started with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the evenings who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team coach, like Walton, announced that James will play the initial game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still has to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After a week's training, they asked James about his plans at the time of six Lakers' parties.
At these heights of my career I don't need any early games to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral actions reach Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign midnights tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the five mediums programmed by Trump for the next week, including stops in cities near him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a slow confirmation vote for its candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-mandate elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
The Trump myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's myth in West Virginia followed by direct transmission via YouTube.
Trump will probably address the subject of the trial held this week at the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been rescinded by allegations of improper sexual conduct and who hold the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this series of mid-days is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five mediums that Trump will give next week have as their goal "dimise volunteers and sympathy while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season," said a trumpeter who preferred not to be named.
The morning of this night, which will be held at the Wesbanco stadium, could bring together the sympathizers of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which it won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the investigations.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Team shows enough to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual parties
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's exercise could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating push belt is a completely inventive sport concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say that the impulse is now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we take it as a little push," Jordan Spieth said while he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of benefit with more sweetness in the game.
The United States, said Spieth, feels they have a little bit of wind in favour and much so that they can be encouraged, among other things, by the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth was fatally successful from tea to green and is preaching with example.
These rubber rings were made stronger as he progressed his round, making a crucial hole to cover the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the shit he made them win the game on the 15th, he kicked a similar ring, the guy who says he thinks the U.S. team's still not out there.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing that's left for these players now.
18 holes to leave stuck.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unforgettable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a fooly Saturday morning, but they also avoided them Saturday morning morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes you came in the morning.
That passage, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards the crowd and from it, confirms them as you dare to beat Sunday, and there could not be any more popular players to win when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
preferable both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly discovered Sergio García, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, when he got along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first race ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never ready to leave.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely through the interactions between couples, the advice they give, those not and the way in which they can change a strategy at once.
Europe played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this forum session also proved that the U.S. Team has enough to fight, something that some, especially stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the Fourballs and Foursomes with a 10-6 advantage on the United States.
The two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the task with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to raise four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who sought to preserve the trophie they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning's fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forums, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four points followed, while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a weekend of sensuality, are the second couple to win four points of the first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After scouring Woods and Patrick Reed on the four-balls, they were able to defeat a disintegrated Woods and the new U.S. Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categories.
Woods, who argued two parties on Saturday without punishment or glory, showed occasional flashlights of brightness, but now he lost 19 out of 29 parties in the fashions of fourballs and foursomes and five followed.
Justin Rose, who would rest at the four-balls this morning, came back together as his couple Henrik Stenson in the foursoms in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world's.
Europe could not always win a pleasant day of break in the south-west of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas campaign set the point of reference for the United States by getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory on Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Fourballs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the Fours after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team renumbered four points in individuals, although as the current trophie owner, Furyk's team only needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, an attack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea not to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its confidence in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho communicated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea would take " important measures to show its good will" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and missiles, demanding nuclear testing fields and committed itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see the corresponding answer by the U.S.," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri was recognizing the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded for its measures, its declaration seemed important, since it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it did with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has since its mother sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has declared that the first Pyongyang should place its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first nuclearization" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive output, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us neglect is an impossible dream for someone who doesn't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions cause our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different than last year, when he was told by the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "bad president" Trump was called Kim "the man fled into a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take measures for disarmament, but said that there was still much work to do and that the sanctions should remain until North Korea is denuclearized.
The mayor Trump said there was no time for it, and that "it takes two years, three or five months at the same time".
China and Russia discuss whether the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council that "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with determination and without exception until we observe total, final and verifiable denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri at the United Nations General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in prison saying that he had progressed only a few hours ago that North Korea was accused of making "mafious indwelling demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to detonate the use of missiles, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He indicated that Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he requested were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more to combat the growth of the machinist culture to study all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Müller Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of these in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sound on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why are they only telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, what surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sound habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of a duration implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, cortinas, formers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at the time of fasting.
In another section, participants are informed how prolonged sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the fields with interactive icons encourages participants to think in their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, so we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose tobacco," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to spend all night wake up still exists, and it adds that modern technology and pressure for the students involved in lack of sleep were a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps well enough and that he has a sound of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoiding being confused, since the lack of sleep makes the brain in a way of induction, which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course throughout the campus.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option of setting up an alarm to stand, as well as when they wake up. However, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lighting, which may imbalance the circular rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack repatriated Steven Gerard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record his first win at home from the triumph for 4-1 in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat of Gerarrd in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team with eight points of Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a little inspirational alignment of the Rangers never gave the sense of being empathized.
While the Rangers descended to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a hole of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have been treated by a wound in his head by a supposed launch of an object.
Gerarrd made eight changes regarding the team that drew Ayr into the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scotch League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of Livingston who took a point to Hearts last week and would have been so excited that his organization would have put their opponents down at all times.
The Rangers may dominate the possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the balloon.
They could've marked it in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's port, but the central champion lost this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just got him back into the second peace.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have been punished for 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the judge, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but the old guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibary's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston at 34 minutes could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again to face Jacobs' strong training.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, which kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerarrd acted in the rest when he changed the Coulibally by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the storm passed over Morelos, but the imposter Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to spoil visitors by playing exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball behind each other.
Holt's team might have expanded the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor rose up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
The Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he came in with Jacobs, but Thomson returned to making the look fat.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTADO... was the day that the physical future of John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A foot of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("The Coronado Camps"), sponsored by those apparently insulating vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these auriculars are placed, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals can be heard."
Evans said, "I'm sure you're staying now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that brings her name survives.
The new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which change in the laboratory so they can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "enforces the growth of various types of cancer", including mothers, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "insignals" to treating cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West aboard a speech for Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) draws its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they found Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he commended US President Donald Trump and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third night's song, called Ghost Town ("The City of Fantasma"), where he carried a dress from Make America Great Again, he criticised the democracies and reiterated his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white guy and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the program with a satiron sponsored by Matt Damon, where Hollywood star was excommunicated from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the US Senate's Court of Justice about the demands for sexual aggression made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been issued, Chris Rock has raised images of West criticism on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get out of the West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been through a bad time in the boots because of his throat.
"They flew with me in the boots.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They're scaring us!
And then they said I was going to pick up," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?" saying that I would go "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments caused applause in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed embarrassed, reported to the magazine Variety, with the following witness that a person there gave the publication: "The whole study remained absolutely silent."
They had been appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplex people with an interpretation of song I love it ("Encantamme"), dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West gained the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the most powerful spirits: Thank you for making FACER FRANCE TO MAFIA"
However, the presentation of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "to be who it is and that's absolutely wonderful".
"So anyway, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by understanding their music or clothing or by supporting their "art") who I think is going to embrace and spread a ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "the officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The Public Taxation Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of machinist hero, saying that these roles on the screen are translated into which boys seem to have to be hard for them to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo (#YouTamén).
Kit, who recently met the Co-Protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "too strong" to deal with the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, what do we make mistakes with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: "What is born and taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they must be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the great questions of our time; how have we changed that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequalification or game of Thrones when the series comes to its end next summer, saying that "a lot of horses and fields of battle".
Starting in November, Kit will mark a true West (The True West), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so, of course, I gave my future family and my life here before," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple happened in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected by health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marked a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV this way had been practically reduced to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in inter-annual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people was extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men having sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of the staff would filter data from the Republican Party's senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, the representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the pages of Wikipedia of the lecturers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of "ultraderight".
"Ministers, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the information disseminated included the individual addresses and phone numbers of Utah US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a hearing from the Senate panel on inappropriate sexual conduct charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtering appeared shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, communicated to Capitol Hill.
"This baseless charge is completely false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtering of this information.
This baseless charge is completely false and a complete lie."
The Waters statement immediately raised criticisms online, including those of the former Secretary of Press of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This nonsense was made hot," Fleisher wrote.
"I understand you don't have time to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
The prosecutor's reasons should not be questioned.
It must remain attractive and with seriousness."
It seemed that Fleisher was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Justice Democrats, to which critics accused him of being too angry during the hearing of the jury.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true," shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities responsible for compliance with the law and appropriate authorities with these fraudulent charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," he continued, "as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team."
Critic of Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new movies from a British point of view and it seems that this can apply to the return of this parish and comedy of action by Johnny English, who started with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the sad ironic about the obvious stupid issue that we are on the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any way, Johnny English's incompetence character and gay face renewed his license to destroy things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comical creation designed for non-english cinemas territories.
Of course, it's the little secret agent who, despite his extraordinary claims of adjudicating glamorous, has a bit of Clouseau, a chip by Mr. Bean and an anaco of that kind that contributed with a single note on the theme of Cars of fire in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also based originally on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted Barclaycard's forgotten TV ads, where he buried the chaos on his way.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medium-sized armory suit and the rotor steps make a short blow against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the view, but it makes the impression that humor has little power and is extremely superfluous, especially when this type of "serious", such as 007 and Mission Impossible, they already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed to children, instead of adults, and, in my opinion, the extraordinary adventures of Johnny English are not as old or concentrated as the film chips change from Atkinson when facing the character of Bean.
Now the permanent topical argument is that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirate infiltrates into the UK's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the distress of the agent who is in service, a poor little paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the column for a prime minister of posing and conflict, who has already suffered a total crisis of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives you the best with this person who almost seems Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your informal intelligence advisers that as all spies have committed themselves to active, you must remove someone from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetence Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extraordinary classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some chips, when English offers the Spanish Academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and meet with their former and suffering partner Bough, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service returned to action, meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is taking a dangerous turn towards the beauty of the multimillionaire technological charisma that claims it can solve the British computer problems: left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their idea of ridiculous falsified jokes: broken camareers, they fire at a stubborn French restaurant; they create a bullet that illegally puts them on the edge of Volta luxury ice; and English causes total anarchy when they try to use virtual reality cassettes to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Of course, all detentions come out of that last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems removed from a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as happened with other Johnny English films, you couldn't avoid thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to design a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that covers five.
In fact, the party wants businessmen to spend the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional free day.
In this way, employees would enjoy at the end of a three-day week, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to target the country for the benefit of workers.
The Syndicate Congress supported the four-day shifts per week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a working week of four days is an ambition that is adapted to the approach of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a working week of four days during its campaign for the general elections of 2017.
So yet, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A working week of four days does not go into the party's politics and is not being considered by it."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "expectors" in public service companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in the Shadow also involve the possibility that current water companies shareholders do not recover their entire investment, as a labor government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers in company councils and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the private sector companies' shares to employees, which pay annual dividends by up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question was raised as to whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, on the release of an interview, the reporter of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could take out something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the charge came out and asked if I had done it.
He was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems irrevocable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett naked around," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive map of stars that will act and a mission also impressive, ending with world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people streaming into the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy actions like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness about the real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that looks forward to ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about its goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a curious way to persuade people to take action or is it just another case of what's called "clivism", people who think it makes the difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, encouraging a set of different objectives.
He states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37,000 set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or reimbursed.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.S. investor and executive company that has committed itself to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Global Cities tweets.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the sick, the national authorities and Global Citizen sympathizers like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the page of history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out to improve the nutrition of girls and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-parity movements and in favour of the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the artists who will act on this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the sea to carry out a "block" to make Russia's energy exports difficult, U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced
"If necessary," Washington can resort to the sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, from developing the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as he quoted Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it works at the offices of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, together with the sea, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists of, more or less, using and replacing fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia saying "it has only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was in a mission to promote exports of its natural gas liquidated to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "undecompensated" North Stream 2 oil project which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into "citizen" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 oil from $11 billion, which has been established to double the existing oil capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic mer project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, taking a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The stand taken by the United States resulted in Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German-led sector leader organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI, by its German signatures), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider his candidacy to the president in 2020, of Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that he would carefully consider his candidacy to the presidency bringing mid term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his application.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repeat the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"On 6 November, I will carefully consider my application to the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was " taking this country away from the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, in a survey published by the xues, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe it will be presented in 2020.
The 50 percent of Massachusetts' "problem" voters said that the senator would not submit his application, according to the study of the Suffolk University's political research centre and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the old governor's candidate, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in relation to a possible candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide it officially before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin cites the post-raumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the myth of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after she left in September
On Monday night, they were arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the injuries with which our soldiers return," Donald Trump told the audience in his morning in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo topic and that his son and other war veterans, "are different, strengthened, wondering if there is any respect for what military and aviation partners, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They arrested the Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered in a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while he was Jewish, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman from the police department of Wasilla.
18 states and the Columbia District challenge the new asylum policy
Eleven states and the District of Colombia support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, the representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported to NBC News.
The full name of the applicant part of the price of Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States of America by Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his couple "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused him, but that the U.S. officials rejected his 20th anniversary asylum application.
Defire him in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing problems that are generalised with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The general prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assisted in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition is contrary to that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
Taxation continued to be discussed in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that "give labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges who no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day throughout the world.
Relief efforts desperate in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her febrile baby at the city's evacuation centre in Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is low."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their lost possessions, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake are depleted.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the bones and the shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated for free air due to continuous and strong replications.
His eyes filled with tears as he explained how the violent earthquake hit the hotel room on the fifth floor that shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The walls ruined me, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and, then, just quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of using "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published an announcement of four pages in a newspaper in the United States preaching the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress, which will be held on 6 November, as China refuses.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked what officials in that country had hosted in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to co-operate with China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing commercial war bearing witness to the level of tariffs in their imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensating tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to warn the exporters of states such as Iowa, who supported the Trup Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the governor of Iowa, one of the main exporters of agricultural products in China, stated that Beijing had warned workers, farmers and North American businessmen.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Moines Register Sunday, it was expressed that China "is intensifying this campaign of harassment by distributing propaganda ads in the free US press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the so-called North American tradition of freedom of expression and press when publishing a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, in the place of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the views expressed by the Chinese that may have on China's worrying economic traction, since the media are under the firm Polish of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he says that "one of China's most important newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is a newspaper.
Kavanaugh's disaster cost the women's Republican vote in a few days of half-mandate elections
Although many of the main republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the next half-command elections.
The reactions to these charges were numerous and the majority of the Republicans took their position to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that there is no doubt that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arisona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the souls of angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," reflected Dr. Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
The next morning, the oppositioners, at the "Access to November" strike, appeared in the Senate hall, while the Republicans, under the supervision of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
But it's still going even more, especially among women who vote in favour of the suburbs or those who are between 18 and 29 years of age, who still don't like the President, they don't tend to go to the Urs."
Before Ford's public witness described his sexual assault charges against the candidates of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it would be possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This turned into a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the United States is divided between the belief in Ford or Kavanaugh's witness, although they are more inclined to support this latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe in Ford's testimony in total or likely, compared with 35% who supports Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, a 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared with a 30% who thinks the same ford.
Drag the pressure carried out by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in the state of Hebrews when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed the genitals at a university party when he studied in Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launchs a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a firm based on Solid, the open code platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee succeeded in hiding Inrupt's intention is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data store or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will be available in a single browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data storage unique is that the user has a complete control over whom you can access the information.
The company defines this as "personal pressure through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to his President John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help solid be available to the world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a voluntary programmer community.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change that would change their business models one day to another.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new website based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet to establish the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been raised as an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic with this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Honors Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was concocted with the Cross of Victoria during World War I received a posthumous honour in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and vice-president Bernard Vann was galarized on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a franchise four days later without knowing that he would be given the largest British military co-ordination.
On Saturday, their two grandsons were responsible for discovering a memorial memory in their honor in a Rushden (Northamptonshire) file.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandmother's phase that deserved his title.
According to the publication London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion through Saint-Quentin's channel "through a dense cloud and under the play of a heavy metal fire".
Later he learned to get to the fire line and, with a "great bravery," directed the line forward before facing with a cannon and no one's help, and pulling out the three people of the enemy's conquest.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German franchise on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live but a lesson like that."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown of flowers after the show, which led to the imperial youth gang Brentwood.
Michael Vann said to feel "I'm honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the role of MMA officers at the best time
Imagine taking all night smart to enjoy the whole show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 battles, being six mains, and was being sent directly to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see the faces, the United Kingdom's spectators were shocked when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
A lover described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"The state law ruled that this content was not appropriate for 6 in the morning, and therefore had to change to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and Bellator's Communication Vice-President, when he was asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Cooker, President of Bellator, said that they will take into account United Kingdom spectators in future programming.
"I think we can solve when we think about repetition," said Cooker.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five wars, instead of six.
I'm very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower due to her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic skipper, says he grew up feeling inferior to the whole world because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to trip.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to school.
Invited from the first issue of the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 programme led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to realize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual representative of this program, is sickly.
As invited by Laverne's first program, Daley shared that it was "lower" than the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you'd like children and girls."
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and different beings is what motivated me and gave me the strength I needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became an outstanding LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Australian Commonwealth games to ask for more countries to deplore homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of the effects, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times the world's champion said he liked US producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "was a surprise."
Daley has been in this Oscar winner last year and says that the 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
"When you live so little time" (with only 14 years of age he participated for the first time in Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who will experience similar heights.
The couple had her first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley change his outlook completely.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he said.
"But now I know that there are far more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son takes the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't agree that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was enter London 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I didn't tell you I wouldn't be here to take over that first row," shared Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that it was really not invasive," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that time they knew that it was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling" confirmed.
The choice of the song Proud of Heather Small is not in vain either, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair at his fingertips.

A low-form Mickelson ended up in Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
The U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the 12th Biennial event, remained in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and couldn't participate in the four-balls or Saturday's four-days.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times for the United States, the five times the campaign spent the day encouraging and working to improve its movements.
Although it was never the most necessary of the players, not even at the moment of their career, at the age of 48 it does not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass tends to punish the wrong shots.
And because this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced on the ninth Sunday at the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties this week.
If the United States, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good foot, the action of Mickelson could be completely crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, although he couldn't say much more.
"You fully understood the role I played today, gave me a palm in my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that I would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"I was completely confident in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Fama Hall and contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end, that's what things are, and that's how we think they should be.
Like everyone else wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will skip Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm tree.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 victories and seven victories, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides an incentive to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with insight and he likes to get along with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good that the younger players have done with this week.
It's a lot more with a good player."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, afraid of the loss of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last few days of Ryder Cup individuals can easily be converted into an uncomfortable trip.
The Great Danes started in 1997 at a party in Valderama, where a team captained by Hise Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the United States, but they ended up reaching the target line with a minimum advantage winning 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderram; like Brooklyn, where we lost, but in Valderram we won a little bit," Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion, won 5-3 Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this hasn't ended yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophie, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but they're also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Fascinated by the performance of his players in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I would never win before.
We'll meet another animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner on the side when things go well, but when you face things individually, then prove your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to send to players, which takes the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also take out the best of himself."
The difference between Bjorn, Jim Furyk, will seek that his players have a better individual performance than with their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three four points.
The Furyk himself was in two extremes of these last day's rounds, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending up as a loser leading European miracle in Medina."
"I remember every one of those damn words," he answered when he asked if he remembered Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, would meet with the players on the last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but you would like to have a quick start like Brooklyn or Medinah.
When you see the pulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in these middle parties.
We prepare our alliance taking this into account and put it on players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIllroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the class.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship was once again placed
The latest cargo of the German Army should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not be until the next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class flammable, joined up until the first half of 2019 and reported a military call to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into Mariña in 2014, but the problems behind delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Armada commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class fleets.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful cannon, with different anti-air and anti-bukes missiles, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared wires and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to expose the newest fractures up to two years outside the port of origin.
However, as pointed out by Die Zeit, these continuous delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be ancient when they enter service.
The F125 broke down was news last year, when the German Army officially engaged in commissioning the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Yous striker in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Mariña returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of warships on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, since Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 mariners, i.e. half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class fractures.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had an excessive dramatic weight, which reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the Marine to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7,000-tonnes Rhineland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches an amazing amount of EUR 3100 million, compared with the 2200 million initials.
The problems of the newest fleets are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German fleet is making floods.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that Mariña is staying without suitable ships to unload.
The official claims that this problem is growing, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
However, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could join Mariña.
National Trust Spiezes the Secret Life of the Cats
A new research is being carried out at a Highlands of Scotland to reveal how the ants use their land to search for food.
It is expected that the results will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the Pypistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the mercego Myotis dawbentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverwe in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be installed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the ants during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with manual detectors.
A sound analysis carried out by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the pigs and that is making each species.
Next, a housing map will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects results to show that habitat areas are more important for mammals and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of nests and what is the best way to keep forests for mammals and other associated species.
The populations of pigs in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by works of construction and development that affect children and loss of habitat.
Air generators and aluminium also pose a risk, as well as muscle trappers, some chemical treatment of construction materials and domestic cat attacks.
The dolls aren't blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
Use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight traction.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes very seriously the ants.
It has ten trained experts, carrying out periodic surveys, child inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scotland's truces in Drave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth of the ten species of Scotland's.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for kids," he says.
"We meet with old buildings, historical trees and a wonderful apartment.
But there are many things we don't yet know about the ants, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of infants before carrying out maintenance tasks in the property, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal child may kill up to 400 women and children, which could end all local populations.
The crocodiles are a protected species and are illegal to kill them, kill them or maim them, as well as destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still much to learn about mammals and, in the case of many species, we don't know how he's going to his populations."
Ronaldo condemns requests for rape and his lawyers are ready to ask for German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies rape charges against him as a lie, claiming that the only thing that people want is to know by using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these charges.
The front of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, a woman in the United States, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's been said that footballist paid the woman $375 000 so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published her coming.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, caught this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which contains 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What he said today is false," he said before the camera five times the winner of the Golden Balloon.
"People want to get to know you by using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous by just saying my name, as part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to ask Der Spiegel for charges, which qualify as "an unacceptable statement of suspects in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would ask for compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the personal rights of the last few years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a follow-up to the Palm Hotel and Casino of Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where he reportedly violated it once again, according to the documents presented at the Clark County Court of Nevada District Court.
Majorga says that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was upset by saying that he was 99% a knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations authorized by both parties.
Majorga also claims to have listened to the police and had photographs of the wounded, but later she came to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt humiliated by the police and was concerned about the public scan.
A 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would always regret losing its place as the world's car manufacturer leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop its production from Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," adds Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
Burnaston plant, responsible for the manufacture of the Auris and Aventis models in Toyota, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if no agreement is reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very adjusted, every 37 minutes there are parts of United Kingdom and EU suppliers for cars to be measured.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and it could cause delays and loss of pieces.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rate more than one day on the Derbyshire farm, so production would have to stop.
Clark says that theresa May's Chechers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated with precision to avoid these border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, to enjoy the current success but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long it would stop production, but warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competence and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, an employee from Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator from Unity, said his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A spokesman from the government stated that they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be re-examined
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and the Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could delay one more week due to the struggle by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
Whether Trump asks the deputy general tax officer, or if he doesn't, what would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the Rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about using a microphone to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein signed the report.
But last month he attended the White House, among reports that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York, was announced.
Trump said he would rather not have to expel Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock to the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI about the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote on the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "There's still no date set, it could be this week or another week, given everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been holding a press round since September 10th.
When the rapporteur Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to an advert to the reporters' generosity, although it added that it would not be her who rejected that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President gives more interviews than the former President" said, although he did not mention any source to evaluate these data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has an opportunity to ask him directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than to direct questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we are doing this in the last few weeks, and that will replace a press round in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
However, private press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president has demonstrated the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists assembled.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm souls before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing gratitude to the country and expresses its desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scoces government has committed itself to covering the cost of EU citizens who work in their decentralised public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on leave continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations for a possible conflict.
I know this is an incriminating period for everyone.
So I would like to reiterate how valuable the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Members of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Listen, it's your smoke and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker from Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, trainer of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the rest.
Looks like he was disappointed when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him into the chamber to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
However, he added that there is still no details about the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when this injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year of red shirt, is in his first time with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before he left the party, which he raised to 18 his total time.
A stamp tax will apply to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help people without putting into service new conservation plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasure expects to raise up up up to 120 million pounds per year to help people with no money
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without charge.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible livelihoods and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping in the street.
The recharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second live and purchases to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Facenda expects the change to cost up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing a price increase and making it difficult for people who want to buy a living for the first time have more difficulties in accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in capital, have become "pantasma cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy will apply just weeks after Boris Johnson is asked to apply for a cut in the fines tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He urged the great builders to keep the prices of the high living by buying the soil and non-use of it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on modest prices in order to set up "the shame of the living sector" in Great Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to housing, including the control of tenants and the ban on challenges in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant to the larger churches power at the time of building new habitats.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for this it is necessary to set up the destructive market of living.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those who do not live in the United Kingdom as it is for foreign-based companies to buy living goods as for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a lifetime is too far away, and the indignity that you're supposed to not have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to teach Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's electorate at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club in the northwest, which currently covers the third time in League One, the three points of distance from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was playing for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that's all," Ross said to the BBC's Sports Sound program Scotland.
"I believed I saw playing Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when I was a boy, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross's predecessors in Sunderland's training career are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says that he felt no concern about any of these so-consolidated figures in a club so large after he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me will depend on this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to come, but it's probably just to think I've succeeded here if I can get the club back to Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a coach after an assistant period in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and made St. Mirren become the peak of winning the title of the Championship next season.
Ross says to feel more comfortable now than he ever did during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably I found myself in a real crucifix," he recalled, about taking care of Alla.
"I really thought teaching was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It's weird because it wasn't bad for me, I got a reasonable life and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but I like learning.
I always liked teaching and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can hear the full interview in Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to one survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 per cent during the day, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA's commercial consultant, who was responsible for compiling figures, said: "The sunny days and the stay of England in the world of football for more time than expected led to a similar pattern as in June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered a still greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business volume during June lasted during the day.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinking were the best results with increases in consumption above the cuts experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out.
In the pubs and bars controlled drinking consumption increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food was reduced by three per cent."
Paul Newman, who was employed by the RSM company for analysis of opium and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has occurred since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events continues to be the main factors in the area of consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer, however, a decline of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful if this adds to the continued increase in costs.
The heat and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be to say whether the temperature moderation tested during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during the day, which reflects deceleration in brand releases.
The sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry of the United Kingdom industry pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with total benefits of over $9,000 million and is considered the sector reference point.
One out of five children has secret social networks that hide their parents.
One out of every five children (some of them only 11 years of age) has secret social networks that hide their parents and teachers in one survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content will be published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One out of five children (some of them only 11 years of age) are creating social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts (in relation to the social exchange network of Instagram photos).
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "primary" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "violent" her.
The research conducted by Digital Awarenness UK and the Headmasters" and HeadMistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's responsible Mike Buchanan said: "It turns out alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Governing Council.
Doyle is the most prized Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"It is a great deal of respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from their incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I have a lot of desire to make athletes' voices and I hope I can contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlantic Games between a total of four Olympics and who is currently working as a regular commentator for BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only as long as I can determine if I can recover and until I'm satisfied.
It was an exciting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing exercises of ease.
Thank you for the message of encouragement."
An announcement by a mother milk extractor compared to women with cows divided by public opinion on the networks
A parent milk extractor company shared public opinion on the networks with an ad that compares milking mothers with cows that are moving.
To announce the launch of the announced "first silent mother milk extractor of the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new milk extractor offers to girls.
Four real mothers dance in a full-fledged celebrity for the cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like, "Yes, I've moved myself, but I don't have it" and "Because if you don't care, they're not blind, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Museum, muse, I'm feeding babies, muse, muse, I'm moving my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions between viewers. Many of them claimed that this showdown was the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Use of cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give the light in order to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving the light," wrote one.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternally subsidised (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "It's clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But if so, why not use it to announce a milk extractor for girls who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even one woman said that the song seemed "very good."
"I think it's a great idea.
If he was still giving his breast, I'd buy one.
Taking off my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little fired, but I interpret it as a joke.
I look like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad addressed to girls who draw their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "vacaculous".
This is not an ad to praise or dilute the milk industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subsidized.
The concept based on the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can discreetly fit into a maternal subject, which gives women the freedom to move, suggest their babies and even get out of there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's executive company and director of creation, commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a shocking and provocative launch.
By describing the existing parallelism between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges involved as we demonstrated in an interesting and close way the incriminating sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor handles newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures flew into the corridor for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the rhetorical harshness and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign parents to children.
Traditionally, most of the parents were also immigrants without papers and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential parents and other adult members of their flocks would have to send their digital footprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs control service in the United States, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked for a divorce of minors without a company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal activity.
"At least 80% of the people who are parents or who are part of taking them are found illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of these comparisons in the diaspora before they spent one month in their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many will participate through videoconferencing rather than in person in order to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The more time they remain under custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent arguments or attempts to escape by refugee workers and system reports published in the last few months.
Lawyers stated that these fears increase in centres of larger sizes such as Tornillo, where there are more possibilities than the symptoms that a child is suffering from a misperception due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to avoid friends might assume a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam, addressed to the General Assembly of the United Nations, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also supports the role of Vice Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found only illegally in Syria, with the intention of fighting terrorism, and that they would "occupy them in an appropriate way".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the "war against terrorism had almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country destroyed by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dispersion of irradiated measures" that caused refugees not to return.
"We are using the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a major humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebellion against Idlib allowed for further political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large scale from being reached by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would serve as the target of the Shihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to develop a draft post-constitutional constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem expressed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second mission
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would be reelected in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, the impeachment and scandals end their presidency in a premature manner.
Which would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, primary-time audits have multiplied by more than two, up to reaching 1.05 million spectators in the CNN and almost tripled until it reaches 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time spectators, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago by Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the cable channel hearing indexes with 3.5 million spectators during the nights in which important news was produced.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for ABC "Designed Survivor", which is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Chapter.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked him.
"He answered, 'Cause it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the steps that Washington's Jordan can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can be allowed.
Still, I guess something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate on the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", the every bomber of Paul Manafort's 15000-dollar warning bill ("a full of pride"" said Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scathing descriptions on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that you're giving something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars", a space that deals with changes in the characters and daily argumental cycles of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't let yourself lose an episode or stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made a sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside of the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up in the house selling MSNBC while writing CNN.
He was unable to resign while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court pending a trial.
"I remember when we were doing all these programs so everyone at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss commented.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The external money comes to the masses to fund the candidacy of the Camera for the half-reading elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional district with two representatives in careers to take up the same place.
This district located outside Pittsburgh, which has recently been reorganised is represented by the democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is present to another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely above the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in a way that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circuit of the former districts for their benefit.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congress district has triggered a campaign financing festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Committee for the Democratic Campaign of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching an adjusted victory in the special March elections for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
This place was occupied by a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats an advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing Salvador for its support to China and then threw it back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even had a hotel in Panama until his associates threw it on the Trump Organization's steering team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order the heads of the United States diplomatic missions of Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US assistance during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic assistance, was met.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials supported the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid people's migration to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possible application of sanctions for Salvador.
It is programmed that Vice-President Mike Pence direct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance it gives to administration, the diplomats said.
The three North American emissaries discreetly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House said that he commented on the details of the debate, which were described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations at all times and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration and also agreed to speak whenever their anonymity was preserved.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstacles to Mr. Trump's justice, of which there are now ample evidence in the public record.
According to him, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign was aimed at Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to account for this body, just when it has to be prepared for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very ignorant and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to strike a state blow against Hitler if the western front stood up and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that occurred later.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflation, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States faces a number of these inflation points at these times.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump asks the Deputy Public Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to the oven since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly writing to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the task.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite serious allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the election of half-legislator by a Congress that demands responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subject to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known to the ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to take Shabat's prayers on that table that included a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is an optimist for encountering Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna Choves knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empathy achieved in Spain in front of Villareal this same month, would place them in a very favourable position to classify themselves in the Group G of the European League.
A general injury prevented central champion Graham Dorrans from starting this time until the empath 2-2 front of Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could achieve something positive and reach a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but, in general, maybe the impact is a fair result.
It was probably better during the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
The next Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good outcome in their last game, but with the support of our public, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive outcome.
Last year it was hard among everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there is a great environment at this time.
The team is good, the kids are going well and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget the past time and have succeeded."
Women are concerned about the savings for their wedding
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were as clear as they wanted to care for them, few people talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said that they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they'd talk to their children about the subject.
"People want you to take care of a family member, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Department of Life Insurance of Nationwide.
You can start next time.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family so they can take care of you if you don't tell them your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to find out where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a determining factor at the time of determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the financing options for long-term care are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in fact to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
Sell your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical attention and ensure that professionals are able to meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine your father or mother has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be in a position to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note that this information is detailed in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue in play, but who are the doctors who care for it?" asked Martin.

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots with a compressed air rifle while walking back home after going out in the night.
The victim, 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he received shots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred about 02:30 (British summer time) as "an emergency act".
The victim didn't see the rapist.
Their wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu came on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the shortness of communication, the rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Doghaa regent, a zone located in the north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Then we provided you with some key information about Palu and Doghara on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west side of the island of Celebes, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Doghara is a regent that is located over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regression, an administrative region lower than a province, accounted for a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Doghía.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Doghea were affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years by the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Doha in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the high-symetic Pacific Fire Cint, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami affecting 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Yava, the most popular island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, causing almost 700 people to die.
2009: It produced a 7.6 degree magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake affected the Mantawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the rejection of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction caused by earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died from the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes were produced on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily driven.
Arrested the eldest son of Sarah Palin on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Wasilla, Alaska, was suspected of a domestic violence crime, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and by resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention in the contingents of Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a $500 loan, according to KTUU.
He presented himself before the jury on Saturday, in which he declared "not guilty, since now" when he was questioned, reported the chain.
Palin was faced with three minor crimes of type A, which meant he could go into prison for a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a minor type B crime, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently found in the Alaska War Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and possession of weapons in the Jewish state in relation to the incident.
His boyfriend accused him of poking a hole in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-raumatic stress disorder syndrome that is suffering after serving with the army in Iraq.
A earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
It is reported at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of holes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and it is expected that the death balance will increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Central Celebes, in the northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos by the partner networks where the time of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal taxes are trying to apply a few times applied death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike ride from the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, destroying the lives of the pain and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and caused serious injuries "intensely", according to the notification of the death penalty application intention presented in South New York District.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the divorce document.
Weeks after the attack took place, a federal jury presented Saipov with an imputation of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, practices usually used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and pre-meditation", the prosecutors declared by describing the way Saipov carried out the "dangerous, cruel and abusive" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco" as indicated in the report of the intention of the prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South New York District didn't process a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug traffickers, but finally he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It was declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a statement of guilt with a permanent chain without the possibility of withdrawal will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the persons involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team would first ask the taxpayers who did not apply for the death penalty.
A tory MP says NIGEL FARGE should be placed in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "moving a "people's army" today during a protest at the tour conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that negotiations with the EU should take place.
Ordinary Member Peter Bone said before the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would "have already gone" from the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the split lines of her party was demonstrated by joining the Torias to remain in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The first minister is fighting to keep the commitments of his Chechers plan between the attacks of Brexit's party, the contrary and the EU's.
Their allies insisted on continuing their fight to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between their plan and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihull's move that he wanted to finish with the Chechers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been contacted to assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given a job, we would already be out of the EU at these times," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must cancel the Chechers plan."
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone ignored the suggestions which indicated that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is completely false".
The member of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns' story and partner also attended the event, since he said to the reporters: "The only thing I say is: the first minister, listen to the people.
"The Chechers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopulated between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and let us be elected.
Cancel the Chechers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the concentration that it is necessary to "feel uncomfortable" to politicians if they intend to deceive the decision taken in the 2016 reference.
"This is currently a subject of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat on Brexit's decision and we're here today to tell them that we won't let them out with them."
In a message directed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilized by the army of people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the parties to remain in the EU conducted a march through Birmingham before a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
Several activists filed posters with the message Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) after the group started this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis burgeoned the conservators for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit does not exist well," he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about presenting himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider his candidate to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future on Saturday at a municipal session in a western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present the election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It is focusing on the speculations that put it as a result of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its voters using the form of the church since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked her if she was planning to present herself to the president.
Warren replied that this is the time when "the women are going to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that, a woman is in the office of the presidency".
A arrest related to the death of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge's police, Os Ángeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wade Sims, the LSU's gambling player.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (the hour of the east).
They'll publish a video of the shooting on your coming to ask for help to identify a man who was out in the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by shots near the South University campus at the first hour of the spring.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound on his head and finally died as a result," reported chief of police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be present on the scene with a gun and allowed to shoot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and placed under custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-foot young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since the time Valtteri Bottas was classed before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who had left the pool, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the first boxes and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes a little later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after several wheeled manoeuvres that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the inside at risk of being delayed after a double defensive manoeuvre in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the exit grid and went back to the seventh time at the end of the first time on his 21st anniversary.
He then led the career for a large part of this thanks to keeping his pneumatics to get faster in the final part and to move on to Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally he entered boxes around 44 but couldn't move any position in the last eight times, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth term.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to achieve the first two phases," said Hamilton.
A Little Adjusted Body Language
President Donald Trump welcomed Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistently stating that he would not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech carried out in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly to the witness given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented on its location that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "merciful, rebellious and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last days of the Senate, when it comes to anger, when it comes to people who are angry and who are cruel, rebellious and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say: "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make any filtrations?
They remember their answer... you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
We filter it?...No." added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent her a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in December and filtered in early September, but Feinstein promised that the filter would come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't filter your history," Feinstein commented to the committee as reported the newspaper The Hill.
"I asked him to keep his confidentiality and do what he asked me to do."
But his rejection did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that the body language was not the right one.
He may not filter it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to recover power through any necessary means.
They are malicious and rebellious, they don't care about who they are, who they have to struggle to recover power and control," said the President according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two holes for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered by coming to Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained a quick advantage through two bucks Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie arrived for the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard came to Dundee before two holes from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third hit at the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who were able to go back to win Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast the night of the night.
It was the fourth time meeting between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories to the Giants prol.
Dwyer's initial goal was produced at 3:35 p.m. thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an early period, Sullivan again put the local team at the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt attended Cownie to mark the match goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants were in front of the marker before the first break when he marked his second round of night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard returned the game with a ball by power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and ensured victory through the fifth goal of their team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who now lost four of their last five parties, will play at home at Milton Keynes their next party, which will celebrate Friday.
An aircraft traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered heroin after death to ensure that an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers can safely be safely released.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many disappeared after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawasi, causing a tsunami.
Strong Replica continues to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the castles of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung managed to leave his place at Mutiara Airport Control Tower Six Al Jufri de Palu which was violently balanced.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the exit track at the time, could be safely released.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision may be allowed to save hundreds of lives, reported to Australia's ABC News channel.
We're preparing a Balikipan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Let's break our heart when we're buried," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death penalty may be thousands of dollars and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Doghea, Sig and Butung is limited.
"The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the helmets and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the agency.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral or Sunday will be celebrated.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and live.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
The possible water is scarce.
People are getting out of the minimerized."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're gonna find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday and communicated to the country's military: "I ask everyone you work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
You're ready?" He reported to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there's a missing plane accident in a lake
The airline operating a flight that starved in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says there's a disappearance after it had previously claimed that the 47 passengers and crew would leave the plane that was crashing.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airport reported that I was working with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the more detailed information requests about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The zone's ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash of the plane against the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airport reported that six passengers continued to stay in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continues to be unclear.
Both the plane and the U.S. Army confirmed that the plane landed on the lake before reaching the ground track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane went along the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American national passenger, commented that he entered very little.
"That's extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to make progress between the water that reached them at the station until the emergency exits of the plane were falling.
He also remembered that the flight assistants were crying and scared, and that he suffered a mild wound on his head.
The U.S. Army indicated that mariners who were working near the site in the repair tasks of a beach also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable ship to move people to the coast before the plane landed about 30 metres away.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composed of night's chronology in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor sent him to trial on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of smoking a woman from Mississippi lived in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to compensate for the motions of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that demonstrated that Tellis met with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these data showed that his mobile phone met Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went down the street on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "false because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"Borrow of your life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defense begins its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge showed that he expected the judge to be seen for judgment by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the sensitive hip hop?
A hip hop third wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says the hip hop has gone away from its sources with political and combative messages against social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get back to that fighting hip hop again becomes popular.
Artists like The Refugees and Common have recently experienced a return in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York children's nurse asks a couple after a "racist" message.
A nurse of New York's children will ask for a discriminatory couple after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from her mother in which she complained she was "other black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her distress when she found out that the nurse of the children of Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After taking account of her mistake, a "unfriendly" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, saying that the carer who had just left, who was an African, had done his job badly and was expecting a Philippines according to New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her the day of work and sent her home to Uber.
Now Maurice will ask the couple to get compensation for the order and require a fee of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired yet there is no medium-term contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," said the Post next, adding "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to racist charges saying that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable thing, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she had been raped.
"My wife will send you a message that she didn't intend to send.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they wronged, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby for two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their behaviour and by the logic applied.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not be identified with an ear speaking as long as they could end up in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented about the letter: "It's hard to put into the hands of a person who first read it before it was published.
It is very fun to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After claiming that his father, who worked as a camera for BBC before inspiring himself to write the book about a little play dog, would be optimistic before he could give up his job, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was "agridoce" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was clearly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing prisony," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that got something: you're proud yet you didn't really do it to you.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was a creation and a product of its imagination, it always gave him all the merit of Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying, and I had to leave through the phone.
After the earthquake, her daughter was rushed to Niza's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"There was no regular call to say it was too bad, which was not expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors give you so that your heart continues to mourn were slowly consuming and leaving your body.
He was dead a while ago and now he was turning off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to take care of myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at this moment of struggle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane with other passengers, without noting the quail that was falling.
"No one's detected it," he said.
"He's got his head down, and he's all over me.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive sense of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women's posts to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a galley bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to those who can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he died at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to hear me every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"All the world knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile liked any room."
However, he quit his job before he died and was "no deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented: "I have continued concern that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can come and talk to them, even if he is a friend.
Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment that he was sad or depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Nadal's day was deeply touched (when the children opened their arms, he didn't have visual contact with them nor anything)".
He said his death was supposed to be a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "The family disappeared.
We're having a hard time.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs out of a thread while the FBI starts research
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited period of investigation and of limited scope), it is possible that we could achieve a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "lost" due to the paralysis of the parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Your reticence is due to a question of deadlines.
Five weeks are required for half-legislative elections (on November 6th). If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to make the man they wish for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at Mr. Bush's White House, thanks to the fact that he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which is currently occupied by 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to break the pact and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is below Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean reader.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Union Ministry, stated that 1.127 deserts would be produced during the past year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the distortion of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the rates charged by the people responsible for crossing people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North deserters finally offer them to South Korea's citizenship.
It simply states that over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most have gone through China, which has the largest border trip with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates.
The relations between the north and the south (which technically continue in war) have improved significantly over the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-an, held in Singapore, where they agreed to work very hard to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will be first unilaterally disarmed," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and ensured that it was not appropriate for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribunal Festival of Austin, Texas.
"You can't avoid thinking that if a woman behaves that way, she would call it her history," Pelosi said about her reaction to the Kavanaugh statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Yöves.
Kavanaugh emotionally ignored allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost crying and remaining talking while describing his family and the years of his school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies, cataloging the charges against him as "a mass murder and co-ordinated reputation" organised by liberals angered by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think she is disqualifying herself with those statements and the way she attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to force Kavanaugh if he was confirmed at the place and if the Democrats get most of the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are at present," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that could be adopted by Kavanaugh against the patient's protection and care of accessible health or Roe's case against Wade, as a conservative judge is considered.
In confirmatory views, Kavanaugh failed to ask whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a historical person and with prejudice to access the court and still on hope that we will say, look well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise.
He's been dealing with a justistic diet, months and years of anger on board, and he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so rare, do I?"
He continued: "I received a lot of help from a woman who was running somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique consisting of which, when she got angry and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: "The best thing you're thinking is that I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, he went on.
I think it's brilliant."
The blades are allowed as escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most clean memories in one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry with an inconceivable rage, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who always caused me a fear of lightning, and led me to the end of the stairs.
"Never allow them to see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an affair outside of marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why he could not consider it to be presented to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I said between rice 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates on the road and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone named him "Brancaneves and the seven pineapples."
Because the campaign had been advanced, it was delayed in fund-raising, so he swore he wouldn't get into the career of the presidency unless he was able to earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of those who supported him would only contribute $1,000 to male candidates.
"What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (from gratitude to the people who supported him, from frustration to frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and addressed voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) which remained without words.
"You would think of a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You would think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what were they writing on my pencil?
"What's up?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be a positive one for Beijing?
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were devastating and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, first warned the principles of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale was this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Pekin has consistently opposed the same way, the most recent rising rates of five to ten per cent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will move in the short term.
In order to get Washington back behind, it would be necessary to surrender to its demands, but to do so publicly before the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its letters correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favour China for a long time by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-centred researcher for New American Security, a research center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods are now being met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid even from countries supporting the rise.
Europe wins at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points needed to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, which was the most battle he ever offered during the tournament, threw the ball into the water at the 16th floor of Par 3, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist has shone throughout his series, turning himself into one of the only four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth was defeated by the 57-4 player with the lowest rating of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, in Denmark.
The first ranked in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups disputes, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I'm not used to crying often, but today I can't avoid it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to recover the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I am glad to be able to help," said an excited García after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the U.S. golf Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's incredible the pride I feel today for having defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all times, 14 grand winner, located so far behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend so they didn't get out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after his team's frustrating performance, said: "I was proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning they faced difficulties for Europeans.
We're fighting.
I'll take the hat off before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, we'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be Captain.
It's to take off the shadow.
It was superior."
