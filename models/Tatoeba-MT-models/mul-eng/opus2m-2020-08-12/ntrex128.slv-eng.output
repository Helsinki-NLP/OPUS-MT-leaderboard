Members of the Valiant Congregation are concerned that they are "like Mupetka"
Some members of the congregations are threatened with the proposal to re-name the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, sl. member of the Valzian Parliament).
This has led to plans to change the name of the congregation in the Balkan Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political sphere are concerned about smiling.
A member of the labyrinth community said that they were concerned about their group 'because the name of Rome with Twp and Pwp.'
For browsers outside Wales: the twp means a trap, and the pwp is a cat.
A member of the congregation from the Plaidcymru party said their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed other options.
The Valizan conservative said that his "open spirit" group was different with regard to the change of names and at the same time warned that there was a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the words ‘w’ are similar to the words ‘u’ in the Yorkshire order.
The Commission of the Congregation, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of a change of name, stated: "The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the congregation will of course have to be adopted by members themselves."
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valiant Assembly was authorized to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valizian Parliament.
For members of the congregation, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Well Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but has received the highest possible ‘MWP’ in public consultation.
The members of the congregations clearly offer other options, but it will be difficult to reach agreement for President Elin Jones, who must submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Community works, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of its members and the establishment of a system of committees.
Members of the congregations will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their nomination.
The Macedonians will decide with the referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
By voting they want to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
The Athenians have long maintained that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and have repeatedly objected to its requests for membership in the EU and Nata.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including President Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and Natu.
The bells in St. Martin's church are confused because the churches in Harlem are facing problems
"The older people I talked to say they were sometimes bar and church on every street," Adams said.
‘Today neither one nor the other.’
He explained that the loss of bars is understandable.
"People today are dating differently.
At least there are no more living rooms, where people start regularly.’
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon start again.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with joint administration (condominiums) where people who will not help refuge in the remaining neighborhoods.
"The great majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and that is why it will soon come when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condoms will become members of these churches."
Both churches built a white religious community before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community in 1870 and a decade later in St. Martin’s.
The original white methodical church community was established in the 1930s.
The state took over the black religious community that carried out the worship of neighboring gods.
St. Martin's took over the black religious community under the leadership of honest John Howard Johnson, who is at 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led by a shopkeeper who did not want to hire or support the dark people.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when my father - in - law planned to redesign it, the bells were ordered.
David Johnson, the son of the father of Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's church, proudly called the bells "voices for poor people".
The expert who joined in July referred to them as "a cultural base" and "a non-replaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also emphasized that these were the first bells to be played by the time the band was played by the bandist, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was attracted to larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he wasn't replaced in St. Martin's church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, a complex story with architects and contractors has been going on over the past few months; some brought church times and others with scofia.
Zakristija – the administrative body of the soups composed of leaves – wrote in July to the Scofia to ensure that the Scofia will ‘try to bear costs’ to the apple, although it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors who were sent by Scofi.
Some jubilants complained about transparency by the Scophi.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during hunting in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, the sea dog attacked and injured 13-year-olds while hunting yachts while opening the fishing season on horseback.
The attack took place at 7:00 a.m. near the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help, then he went out with the group and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the light, and then he found out he shouted, "He bit me!
He bit me!’
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
"I've all decided to get out of the water, 'There's a sea dog in the water!'," he added.
Fant was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he lives in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that a few weeks earlier, a sea dog had been observed in this area, but it was found not to be of a dangerous nature.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper arm of the body.
In 48 hours, they were unable to access the Ponto Beach beach in Casablade to Swami's beach in Ecinitas because of research and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Saninsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful kittens like them in the bathrooms and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beautiful market worth 2.8 billion GBP and still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, more attractive cocktails will be tested in 11 markets per country and in more markets next year if they are shown to be successful.
To invest in beautiful products, they decided that the supermarkets were looking for ways to fill the police used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say that they will double the offer of their beautiful products on 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brand L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also restores its commercial offer of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products are – something that smaller buyers increasingly require.
In addition, the sale of perfume Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in south London, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online purchases and daily purchases of less food in local markets, supermarkets need to be better able to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail shops would be similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-life products.
The Sainsbury’s group opened the Argos outlet in several hundred shops and also the Habitat store, since it bought both ties two years ago, which increased the sale of food and the acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous supermarket attempts to reopen their compartments with cosmetics and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s was a joint venture with the Boyts league at the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after debate on the distribution of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They said Lloyds would have a role to play in this plan, since in four shops, they should expand the supply of luxury brands for skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director at the Sansbury's company, said: "We have changed the vision and impression of our beautiful cats and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particular trained staff who will be available for advice.
Our offer of a brand is designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and natural sites, but it means that we are now interested in a beautiful destination that presents the challenge of old ways of buying."
Peter Jones' anger because Holly Willoughby got out of work, worth 11 million pounds
The star gives Dragons Den (Good Business) anger because television director Holly Willoughby has removed 11 million pounds from his business, with his trademark of life, in order to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their brand brand and Truly's additions.
Business couples were compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The leader of this morning, 37, announced at Instagram that he was getting away.
Holly Willoughby published the Star of Dragons Den Petra Jones, since she was recently removed from her delivery business with a life-threatening brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "infamous" when a gold girl on the street during his busy meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that because of her new business – up to 1.5 million pounds – there was no time for their brands of clothes and Truly's extras.
The companies compared Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and announced that it would double its assets, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving the trademark Truly, Jones left Britain in one of his holiday homes.
The source says: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future, which would last for the next two decades.
Her decision to immigrate her has completely convinced everyone involved.
No one could believe what's going on in the afternoon, because it was so close.
At the seat of the company in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that this morning's departure from the leadership, which is among the most interesting bank bonds in Britain, would result in a number of millions of large investments in products, from wool and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening up.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughbyva, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years old good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Cappo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple were relaxing together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as I’m A Celebrity I’m host of I’m A Celebrity.
The source near Jonas said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticisms of the media because of a comment that some consider to be "unprecedental" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much?
In his smiling "newist" voice, the trumpet said:
"I didn't leave anything."
He insisted that Kim showed interest in another meeting, and her first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump marked as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see "the appropriate response" to previous North Korea disarmament measures.
He argued that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions that continue to pressure.
The trumpet was much more optimistic in its speech.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship led to positive results – they stopped testing rockets, helped release tanks and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to communication with Kim.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded area full of sight, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Prices and floods in Indonesia left the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, when managing the impact of the earthquake in Lombok, it was said to foreign non-governmental organisations that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the residents of Lomboka have been displaced, natural disasters have not been reported, which is a condition for international aid.
"In a number of cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation was somewhat complicated," said Sumbung.
The Save the Children organisation is a team that will travel to Pala, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
Sutopu, the representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and were assessing whether they would be allowed to help the international agencies.
In view of the fact that there are earthquakes in Indonesia, the state remains totally unprepared for the lack of natural gas.
Thus, refuges were built by tsunamis in Acehu, but on the other side it is not often practices.
The apparent absence of a warning siren for the rabbits in Palu was likely a contributing factor to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that is used to help victims of floods landed in Lombok is swimming against Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure in front of his voluntary campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit poses a problem for the administration of Yoko in the re-election of the following year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim troops fought in the streets with swords, spears and rifles and other primitive weapons.
See for yourself: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge's Department for late execution against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool before defeating Chelsea in 1st English league on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a backbone in 89 minutes.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's gift of good 25 metres before Chelsea's goal at the rest of his team 1-0.
Jogo put it on his left and shot a gun at a remote door.
The bullet traveled high above the criminal space against the right upper corner of the neck.
At the end of the day, she fell through the door of Cape Arrizabalage and fell into a hole.
"I just tried to get to the right location for joggs and players like Shaq, they always pull it as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com about LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch I didn't think much and just decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half with the back of Belgian player Edena Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the blues attacker, with a fifth, threw the yoke back on Matte Kovacic and fled to Liverpool's half.
Kovačić placed it in the middle quickly and went on.
Then he passed through the defense and Hazard fled into the penal area.
Hazard defeated the defense and shot his left leg against the remote door through Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples on Wednesday at 15 a.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in a group part of the League of Firsts.
Chelsea on Thursday at 15.00 in London is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased by 832
The number of deaths of rapes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased by 832, and the state agency reported an accident on Sunday morning.
The representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroh told the press conference that there were many people due to a five-year collapse of 7.5, which broke out six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
A palace with more than 380,000 inhabitants is a site of ruins.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for the amount of murder after a woman was arrested until her death.
The police launched a murder investigation after the women's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseysidd this morning.
44-year-old with poor wounds were found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested 32-year-old man for murder.
The police call on all those in the area who have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: ‘The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on all those who were near the John Street street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to get in touch with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken anything from the cameras to get in touch with us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation.’
The police representative confirmed that she was a woman living in Birkenhead, and the body was found inside.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew a woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her in the morning.
The investigation is taking place, and the police are informing their women.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he left no word.
The residents are now told that they can take more hours before they can come in again.
The police heard how he explained to the man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, everything in the sun.
What goes on to say is "that's so bad".
At 4:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the corridor, and one was outside it right away.
A number of police officers stood inside the corridor and observed the housing block.
All who have any information are requested to write on @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the company Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and indicate the date 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Cup in Parliament has become the most recent goal of the "rewriting history" debate.
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical prisoners of Puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society has identified Crickov's proposal as ‘insistency’ and ‘recording history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of chickens, it has become clear that Oliver Cromwell's appearance outside the Westminster Palace will become a target."
The iconoclassm in the British civil war Cromwell did not even order or perform.
Maybe it'll be the victim of Cromwell's mistake to act by his predecessor from the past century.
The great presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is about an opinion from the 19th century and is part of the historical record of the personality that some consider to be still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell numbers (maybe more later in the 19th century than today) are seen as Parliament's guardian against external pressure in his case of monarchy.
But it's a very precise presentation, it's the subject of no historical discussion.
It is clear that in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a well-known individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements since the time of Lord's protection have also deserved to be celebrated and mentioned."
The killer pig killed a Chinese farmer until his death
After reporting local media, the Chinese pig attacked and killed plants at a market in the southwestern part of China.
A man who was identified only with the example of “Yuan” was found dead with frozen artery and covered with blood near a pig in a market in Liupanshui, the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday in the newspaper South China Morning Post.
The river of pigs is preparing for slaughter of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
After the report, she should report to the brothers on Wednesday from the nearby Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning a brother found him dead, and the door of a neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big single pig with a blood clot in the pig.
Forensic research has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig died of foot-and-mouth disease.
"The brothers' legs were bloody and torn," the brothers quoted the example of "Wu" in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The life that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his brothers.
The store manager told Evening News that the pigs were locked up so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership should deal with the death penalty.
Although rarely, cases of human swine attacks have been reported.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, where men suffered serious physical damage.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram powdered by a Valian farmer at the tractor, but then the woman took away the animal.
After the pigs ate their farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a ‘birth’.
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very happy... they don't want to hurt you.
Just show them a measure of respect enough," he added.
In the southwestern United States because of the remains of the Rosa Orcan
According to the Orcanian Rosa moved against the colder waters of the North Sea of Mexico and the weak.
However, in the next days, Rosa will bring the floods to the north of Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa is from 5.00 a.m. in the morning after sunrise, category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is 620 km south-west from Punta Eugene in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move against the north on Sunday.
While over the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure, which moves east toward the western coast of the United States, will be near the Baja California as a tropical storm and will push a high tropical wave towards the north of the United States on Monday.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical storm that will mix with the low air pressure area will create a severe fall in the wider south-west in the future.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, flooding and the possibility of landfills in the desert.
Due to high tropical flooding, the number of falls in some places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above most of Arizona, it is expected to fall from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to give sand into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can change canyons into the rainbed of the river, while local winds and dust will be brought into the air by storms.
The approaching low-air pressure area will bring local rainfall to the south coast of California.
It is possible to fall more than 12 mm, which may result in a lower drop of rain and dirt on the road.
This will be the first landing for the region in the autumn.
A number of scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday morning morning, late on Monday and Tuesday, and fallouts will spread.
A strong earthquake will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will take place in the middle too.
In October the U.S. can be reached by large temperature fluctuations, as the Arctic is announced, and the tropical regions remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
The week is a great example of dramatic differences in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is 20 degrees different.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set up and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States will enter the hot October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the parts of the north-east.
In New York it could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term order shows good temperature options for the average U.S. east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Bretta Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people have seen an interesting fourth talk on the six television networks by Bretta Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual attack to which she was due in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's overhaul in the last minute: an agreement that was signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will conduct a single-day investigation of the charges.
The Ford told the Justice Committee that 100 percent of Kavanaugh was convinced that he was in debt and tried to get her to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a brown speech that 100 percent was convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday the talk should be viewed by more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average TV viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that were present, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has usually had some problems with the protection of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For a lie presentation, the audience is like those in the event of a final football match or the award of an American Film Academy.
Fox News Channel television, which leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, is running a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
On the other hand, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, 2.1 million NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The interest was also high after hearing.
Flake had a central role in the fifth drama.
Following the announcement by the Office of the Memorial Republican to vote in the presence of Kavanoffu, CNN and CBS television cameras followed on Friday morning as the protesters called on him when he tried to get into force to participate in the hearings of the Justice Committee.
In a few minutes, he took a look at what CNN's live cell phones were doing.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have the power while many women are weak."
Flake said his office gave a statement, and he added that he would tell the committee more about it, and then the door was locked.
All television networks were also distributed live hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the transfer of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do it if they agreed that the FBI would investigate complaints against the candidate for which a minority party called.
Flakea was partially convinced of this conversation with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coon and several other senators then, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes for the appointment of Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump launched an investigation by the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the "playing political games" of the British future and of undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May's arrival at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the headline newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on her so-called Brexit Plan from Chechers and said it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the other "totally absurd".
Shooting on Wade Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of killing a LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect in a criminal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU's basketball team.
After reporting the police from Baron Rougea, the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-stage murder charge.
Officials published a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the battle.
The police found the sunglasses on the scene and Simpson's DNA, CBS television supplements WAFB's TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he admitted he shot Wade until he died.
The security knows $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The observer from the East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for the assistance of the investigation led to the arrest of refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the criminalist State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local traffic authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the LSU basketball player.
On average, the previous season gathered 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU trainer Will Wade said that the team was "pressed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what matters to you all the time," said Wade.
In Mexico City, red - haired wool
The dome that broke the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern coast of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mehicans not to approach the volcano on Saturday because the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 gas and dust emissions were observed within 24 hours.
The Centre observed several cases of pregnancy and adult pregnancy.
Pictures on social networks were shown to tanks of ashes covering the windscreen of cars in the vicinity of the capital city Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protests supporting independence met with anti-fraud police units and thousands of people joined in the naval demonstrations with which they marked the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized vote on withdrawal.
A group of masked supporters of separatist separatism, which were held by anti-fraud police units, attacked them with eggs and metal paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later there was also opposition, where police had to use pendants to stop the attacks.
Supporters of independence, who had been calling for more hours 'without forgetting, without giving up', faced protesters who supported unity and shouted 'Let Spain live!'.
According to local media reports, 40 people in the protests suffered more injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was marked by illegality in Madrid, the Catalan separatists celebrated it, the tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as the opposition to the withdrawals in large measure fought the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in the areas of the region.
Groups supporting independence were camped in front of the camps during the night to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another way.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would be independent.
"Lani has experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they could love, but now we are busy," he said.
While it is important that, although close victory in regional elections last December, Catalan parties which support independence have kept the initiative this year hard because it is the most well-known leaders in voluntary learning or are waiting to be judged because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and later the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police phone, explained that the protest was political on both sides.
‘The tension is rising,’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of the year before the beginning of the harvest, announced that he will apply for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and closures we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men flying by car into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they had been taken by car several times to Londonderry.
The incident occurred in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at about 19.30 p.m. after the British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they should also shoot a suicide bomb against the car.
With Mengaja's back, Livingston won from 1:0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston gave him a victory
Livingston defeated Rangers and Steven Gerard had only to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
Shore Dolly Mengaja provided for the difference because Gary Holta's bridge ended with the Hibernian bridge on the other side.
Gerard's host is thus left without victory in the guests at the annual summit, and the following week the Hearts are waiting for them on board and for which they remain behind eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European Union on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his degree of indomity in the division at the sixth floor and the main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the defeat.
Livingston set the options against the direct guest
The Holt team should be headed just before the rear end, as they caused a number of problems with their direct approach to Rangers.
Scott Robinson made the probosciss, but he threw the yoke across the door, then Alan Lithgow hit outside the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head through the neck.
Guests left the Rangers game because they knew they could be dangerous for guests when they stopped the attack.
And in this way they also came to a key hole.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengay who shot and shot at the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had more goose possession, but domestic defences couldn't beat and the door Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos had excavated Kelly's defense.
The Commander of Ranger's Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his leg, and Lithgow shot him out of one more Livingstone's stop in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's criminal space, but the domestics rejected all attacks, two crossings – Halkett's breach over Glenn Middleton's replacement and the cross by hand – and the judge did not arrive.
«Great performance» Livingstone – analysis
Alasadair Lamont (BCC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Great performance and result for Livingston.
It was clear that everyone was perfect and they were still beyond expectations on their way up there.
The lot of games and events has not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be described as how he woke up a team from his arrival.
It was a lot of Junaks.
Captain Halkett had an extremely important role and had a well-organised defense, while Menga kept himself in the hands of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrella.
The rangers, however, simply lacked hope.
Although under the leadership of Gerard, these standards are extremely lacking.
There was a lack of bullets on the floor – only once successfully overcome the host's defense – and this is some kind of alert for Rangers, who were located in the middle of the forest.
Erdogan was taken in Coln
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin in the morning, they were dominated by laughter and blue sky.
Today is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between Nata's bonds.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of print and Turkish access to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Koln to open a huge new museum.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 chiefs prevented the collection from taking place before the bridge, but numerous supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
It also expressed its opinion of more than a hundred protesters – including many Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to greet him in the country.
In contrast, protests reflect differences over visitors whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others preposterize as an autocrats.
An accident on the road to Deptford: a passenger died during a race with a car
In London, the coach died at a race in which he was involved in a car.
An accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford on the southeastern side of the city about 10.15 after the British summer.
The driver stopped the car and the rescuers arrived, but the man died in the end of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the driver died in a race where the driver ran away on the Children's Street street, about 1.5 km from Saturday accident.
The police made a statement that the police were checking the identity of the man so they could inform their own.
They set up road arrests and moved the bus lines, and the motorists advised them to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in the building
Six prison guards were injured in a building in a strictly protected male prison, reported from the prison administration.
Nered was released in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. after the British summer and is still running.
Police officers from the Tornado unit were called to provide for the building in which eight prisoners are involved and are confined to one wing.
The monitors had fewer damages on their face at the end of the day.
The representative of the prison staff said: "We have called a specially trained staff who will provide for the construction of the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six members suffered injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for it and that this may lead to further rescue."
In HMP Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of criminal acts in the country.
In June, he was reported to have been a prison manager in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, the police were called against the police unit to intervene in a severe condition where the personnel were attacked with billiard bells.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phéonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this will probably happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining energy of the Rosa Orcan is going through the southwestern of the desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
National Time Service has already issued warnings before the emergency floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orcan Rosa should have been up on Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late Monday with the rain.
The national time service in Phoenix has written in a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have preserved the status of tropical hatred or depression within 300 kilometers since 1950!
Orcan Katrina (1967) is a well-known tourist resort 60 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the Orcan National Centre for Orcans provide 50 to 100 mm of individual falls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of south-west deserts, including Rockies and Great Basin, are expected to fall from 25 to 50 mm, each can fall to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of the Rosa Orcan may be a real blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some falls will probably be useful, as the dry season is currently taking place in the southwestern part of the world.
"As stated by the U.S. drought monitoring centre, good 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought," reports weather.com.
The path of the Rosa Orcan is the first to lead to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of Orcan with the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugene in Mexico and moves north with a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The drought comes in contact with the coldest waters in the Pacific and thus weakens.
It is expected that the land will reach Mexico with the power of tropical drought on Monday or in the evening.
The falls in parts of Mexico may be severe and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
"From the Baj California to the northwestern of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm fall with a possible 250 mm fall," reported the weather.com website.
Orcan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and the South Utah by late night on Tuesday.
"The greatest danger we expect from Orcano Rosa or its remains is a severe earthquake on the Bay California peninsula in the northwestern part of Sonore and in the South-West American desert," said the National Orcan Centre.
These floods can cause life-threatening floods and floods in deserts and landfills in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the amount of attempted death after they found 16-year-olds with poor wounds in Somerset.
The injured tenant was found in the area of Excellence Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 a.m. after the British summer.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in Radstock, reports the Avona and Somerset police.
The police are calling on everyone who's on the phone, maybe they've caught up with the event to get in.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh "has endured hostility and anger" by the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is against the inhumanity and unfavourable tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump told the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
The trumpeter said that Kavanaugh "has endured hostility and anger" by the democratic party in the process of its appointment.
Kavanaugh spoke before the convention on Thursday, where he clearly and emotionally missed Christine Blasey Ford’s charges that he had sexually attacked her ten years ago when she was a teenager.
He also told Ford about his complaints.
The President said on Saturday that day "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brightness, quality and courage".
"A vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of the voluntary participation of Republicans in inter-voting elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important love of our lives.
I really work with the candidate," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The trumpet claims that they are democracies on the mission of 'framing and blocking'.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday, the consultant of the Republican party told CNN.
The number of victims increased by over a hundred people in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, bringing large numbers of whales to the shore.
More than a hundred people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when six - foot - long [6 m] waves hit the coast and several carried to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunamy was following a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami danger occurred yesterday, people stayed on the beach and didn't get away immediately, so they became victims," said the representative of the Indonesian agency at the meeting in Jakarta to alleviate the disaster BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
‘Cunami didn’t come alone, he drove his car, old house, everything was down on the ground,’ he explained to Nugro and added that he traveled through the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said some people went down trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Paluja.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency indicate destroyed buildings and shops, wires and damaged bridges and bridges, contaminated with water.
The early sun continued to penetrate the coastal area on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people have experienced some sort of shock.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that energy released in a five-year power surge was about 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and hard line, would increase the size of the tsunami.
He described the damage as "absolute" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater than 200 miles [300 km] north of Palu, in the area of Doghrea, which is closer to the epicenter of growth.
As Nugro said, communications have been completely interrupted and there is no information from the Donghre area.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," said the Red Cross statement and added that personnel and volunteers are being sent to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since the public did not announce that the tsunami hit Palu, but officials say the waves came right at the time of the publication of the warning.
On the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men at the top of the scream warn people on the street near the quays.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and carried buildings and cars with it.
At Reuters they could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the evidence.
The floods and tsunamis have caused an explosion of electricity that has interrupted communication around Paluja, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The authorities report that the army has begun to send freight aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The city airport was open only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo should visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Following the words of Mr. Doseb, the members of the World Vision organization from Dongree have safely arrived in Pal, where they have been employed in the courtyard before their rooms, setting shelters from the fires, but on the way they have seen numerous sights of relaxation.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched emergency aid initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers were not allowed to come to Pala.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, cross-border financing, storage and assistance of personnel shall be permitted only if the place is declared an accident for the areas of national accidents.
That hasn't happened yet.
"We are still treated as an accident at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, it's a national accident', we can accept international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night after Friday’s riot and tsunami in Palu, friends and colleagues of the missing hope that their neighbors will be their neighbors in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They picked up a boy from the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday the rescuers released a woman who had been caught under the debris for two days, and her mother's body was lying on the floor.
Gendon Subbandon, trainer of the Indonesian nuclear power plant, trained two missing nuclear fires for Asian games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The others, caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, were, in the words of Mr. Mandage's students.
"As an elder in the field of nuclear fall I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how at an hour when the news of the breakup of the Roa Roa Hotel went across the nuclear fireplace community, he sent messages to the WhatsApp gamers in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey bullet instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Dads stole $26,750 while filling banks at the center of Newport on the Levee
After reporting from the Newport police, Dads stole 26.750 dollars from the Brink’s security service, which filled the banknotes at the center of Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptyed his wallet in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man "neared up to the Brink's employees' security service from behind" and stole the delivery money box.
After the report, several suspects were seen running from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All who have information on the identity of suspects should call the police in Newport on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name in Ye
Raper Kanye West has changed his name – in Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: "The battle with the official name Kanye West."
The 41st-year-old West has a Ye issue for some time and has also used it for the title of his eight-year-old album, which was released in June.
The change comes right before his arrival in the Saturday Night Live presentation, in which he should present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the poet Ariano grando, who rejected the event for "special reasons", told the author of the award.
The word is abbreviation of his current professional name, and the West has already said that it has religious significance.
'I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, which means 'you' (see ti),' West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke to the radio host Big Boye about the title of the album.
"So I'm you and I'm all mine.
Kanye, which means "one", I changed to Yes – it reflects our good, our weakness, our ignorance, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
At one time West's partner, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without his mind and with big nails.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
newly-elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military forces against civilians, just as the state nears the 50th anniversary of blood violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use forces to close the Mexican people."
At the time that left student movements began to operate in Latin America, on October 2, 1968, the military began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations on the market.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people into criminal society.
Should the financing of artificial intelligence be doubled
As China's become more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it uses for research in this field, a real investor and an expert on artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the US government have indicated the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States has no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China's Ninth has presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The seconding of the budget for the research of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the US and we are looking for the next step in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the possibilities for the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence to take place in the United States, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, Czech author of the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ (Supersle Art Intelligence: China, Silicia Valley and New World Order) published this month the Founding House Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible art intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system of artistic intelligence that won the most prestigious American player of the Othello game and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Googla company.
Lee said he was familiar with previous US government technology competitions, such as robotic competition organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would find the next one easier to find the next spectators.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive State aid, Lee said.
"Not China's one who takes the best academics, but it's the company," Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best with the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should offer a green card to people with an art doctor."
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the art intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Foundation for Natural Science finances people in academic institutions, such as the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established the Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sector, while the White House announced the establishment of a High Committee on Art Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA agency announced investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion dollars.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than US$100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
During the American legislation she wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence that she had done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum on the change in the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday whether they would change their country's name into the 'Northern Republic of Macedonia', thereby resolving the decades of conflict with Greece which opposed their requests for membership in the European Union and Nata.
Greece, which has its province on behalf of Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has introduced a wave into it into Nato and the EU.
In June, the governments concluded an agreement on the basis of a new name proposed, but nationalist opposers claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, but the campaign of the fighter expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 per cent, as much as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum list was raised: ‘Are you for NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?’
The sponsors of the referendum, including the President of the Zoran Zaev government, claim that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and Nato for Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely within the framework of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament acted to respect the results of the vote that would be decided.
The amendment of the name requires a bilateral majority in Parliament.
The State Voluntary Commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported by 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to love my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško in Strumki, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, gave their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which would open the way for the accession of Natu and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small table or table and set it up in front of the chairs set up by those who were going to fight the referendum.
"We are for Nato and the EU, but we want to join with the proud heads, not through the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
The President of the Zaev government says that the NATO membership will make a significant investment in Macedonia which has a level of unemployment of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe there will be a large majority because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and Nato," Zaev said after giving his favorite list.
He added that it would be a positive result of 'increasing our future'.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the necessary voluntary participation.
A second survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 per cent of the respondents would be interested on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
For the referendum to be successful, there must be a 50-per cent share plus one vote.
The failed referendum would mean the first more serious hit on Western government policy, which took over the May mandate.
Look at you: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City won the whole Brighton's defense and the field
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday from 2 to 0.
Aguero's case in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentinian attacker accepted information from the middle of the game.
He was running between three Brighton's defense players and found an open space.
Agura was then surrounded by four green players.
He won one defense player and was faster than others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the criminal space, returned the yoke of Aguera, which was defeated by Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan and sent the yoke to the right side of the network.
"Aguero copes with foot problems," said the trainer of the City of Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he was hit by a bullet at that point."
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue blue with the initial advantage in the first English league.
Gol arrived in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took a deep deep breath at Brighton's half.
Jogo on the left side gave Leroy Sane a nice hand.
Sane touched the goose several times and then sent a goo Sterling against the remote door.
The blue blue attacker was poking a hole in the net just before she fell out of the hole.
On Tuesday at 12.55, the City will meet with Hoffenheim in Sinsheim, Germany, in a group of Lige first.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and spoil them for titles.
The Nationals team has finally disappeared, so there's no special reason for the new attack.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes that he will be able to rely on the Greek metal against the Colorado Rockies team on Sunday. This will only happen if Rockies still have the chance to play at the end, because they have in the West League the advantages of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday with a victory of 5:2 over the Nationals team, Rockies provided at least the host's invitation, but still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere before a large crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will be playing at the most likely level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in the week, but it will probably be in this case that metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal of 34 years old, is in the fourth metal as a dispersion player and would have had enough days of rest by week.
Washington's right-hand man has collected this season 18 wins and 7 victories with an average of 2,53 and 300 exceptions with hits in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Tromp on meetings in West Virginia
The President immediately touched on the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican voluntary participation in inter-voting elections.
"All we've done will be on the couch in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important loves in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really work with the candidate, so I fight for the great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, and that is also happening now.
They are determined to take over the area where they will use all possible means. You can see embarrassment, evil.
They have all the power and control over them, but we will not give them."
In his words, Democrats are on the mission of "pressure and obstruction".
‘And you can see this in the last four days,’ he said and democratics marked as ‘bad, bad, low and lying’.
He presented a member of the Justice Committee, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, with a vote hearing from the municipality.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, no, wait. It was a really bad speech of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The lab party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion is impatient.
When the activist of Momentum's organization in my local party told me it wasn't safe, it wasn't even a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of the members of Parliament from a labist party that we do not wish to express our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has had a similar experience because she's firmly rooted in anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was at the motion of a mystery for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, questions similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a report on Friday's meeting of the Nottingham East labist party, it stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years since I was a member of the local labist party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
In most meetings today, unfortunately, such a tone is not used and the promise of a 'more friendly and mild' policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has already begun.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the laboratory are not allowed and in each opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the guidance of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I once thought we were sharing similar political views were expecting me to change my opinion and take a position I would never agree with – to do so in the field of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak in public – and in fact it is not important what I say – they follow the criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, they condemn medium policy and they tell me that they should not be in the labyrinth.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are intended for me only political.
I am amazed by the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet with the flood of sexist or racist complaints every day but are not allowed to be frightened.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this period of policy is how the rates of abuse have become quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a labist party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of uncertainty or amendment of rules for the choice of a customer becomes more transparent.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to remove my head and not to be so loud, and it will be "all right" with me.
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I joined a labist party 32 years ago, the reason for this was the indifference of the Tatcher government, which literally broke up in my primary school, I have tried to take up better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political convictions, including recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and areas I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their wishes after spending time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of a labist party at a time when the state is swimming against the brexit that will affect governments, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the labist parties or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat after the elections or political advantages will turn me away from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Acts 38:17 Melrose: unquestioned Ayr on top of lestvice
Two well-known experiments have failed several final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won the victory in this wonderful first-time game of days.
Now they're at the top of the forest and they're the only unarmed team of ten.
At the end, the technique on the home side passed their top defenses and better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for satisfaction.
"In our current games we have stopped many trials and are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Happy Ayra team, opportunities have been better spent than we are."
In the 14 minutes of his transformation by Frazier Climo, Colonel Grant Anderson took the lead, but the Romanian card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who won the Warriors' game, meant a number of violence for Melrose and Jason Baggott passed the test without conversion.
At the crossing, climate increased leadership for Ayr, before it was right at midnight and then turned into a self-contained experiment for the result 17:5 for Ayr during the overrun.
But Melrose started the second half very well and tried Patrick Anderson, who transformed Baggoot, reduced the remainder at five points.
She followed a long suspension due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knotta, which had been carried on her luggage, and after continuing Ayr progressed with the trial of Stafford McDowall, which turned him into Climo.
The temporary Captain Ayra Blair MacPerspon then received the Romanian card and Melrose again used the game with the player more with the unconverted experiment of Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the guests returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a Romanian card because of the climate-free climate, MacPherson arrived in the attack.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent a wing player, Gregor Henry, in five guest tests.
Still Game series star begins a new career in the hotel
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is clearly presented in the guesthouse or should be the director of the licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in a popular BBC series, which he also wrote a scenario, plays Jack Jarvisi with a long-term partner in Greek Hemphill comedy.
Two reported that after the next nine seasons, Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
In view of the official documentation, the director of the company Aopiomorn Limited is.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source for Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan want to be included in the "virtual hospitality" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the Court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the seafarer's seat in La Paso.
In public buildings, sea blue flags are being dropped.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Our duty is to return it."
In Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the sea in bloody conflict due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as was the encouragement after the invasion of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the biggest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of an international court to receive it after five years of consultations on 1 October.
"Bolivia has passion, a spirit of unity and impartiality and of course in a positive spirit awaits the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice at large stations throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide in front of Bolivia, which, after decades of inconsistencies, will have to negotiate with Chile on Bolivia's access to the sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic home president, who is waiting for him a controversial battle for re-election next year, has also had a lot of expectations about Monday's trial.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the courts will not decide in the presence of Bolivia – and if so, it would not change much.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has not authorized Bolivia to assign a civil territory and will not decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments have been heard means that the case has been ‘not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a member expert on international law.
And they haven't been talking in Bolivia for the last four years, but maybe they'll have a lot of standing.
"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea," Zarateev said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric from Chile has exposed all the good wishes she may still have.
Discussions between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some points, but it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The state has not changed the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivian representative of Haagu, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring ‘a great opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile’ and ‘the end of 139-year differences with mutual benefit’, he said.
Calzadilla also realized that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the sea issue as a political struggle.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific," he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to ensure that we have to overcome the past.’
North Korea said nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never have destroyed their nuclear weapons for the first time if they could not trust Washington.
Ri had a speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States has invited them to fulfil their promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the States of the fishing in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently before the relaunch of the nuclear diplomacy which was at the dead point more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unn in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is upset if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the contract will result in the end of the Korean war in North Korea.
Washington is careful to confirm the claim without Pjongjang taking decisive measures for disarmament first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a general doubt that Pyongyang thinks seriously about the refusal of a weapon that the State sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
On fashion magazines in Paris, the latest series of large coverages coming into trade with price-added brands in your neighborhood
If you want to complete your collection of coverings or hide in front of the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in their youth and summer 2019 collections a collection of amazingly large coverings that hid a layer on the Paris Week.
It was very ineffective to cover this summer’s Instagram, and the designer sent his spectacular creations to the fashion gun.
Valentine's hair, which was the most outstanding, was a cloth with a wide edges decorated with similar additions, in which the heads of models were completely lost.
The other too big blue supplements included love caps with expensive stones, magic clasps and even pineapples – but your heads will not burn.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of magic masks – exactly the right time for the night of magic.
A lot of colorful masks have protective lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashions.
One creature was similar to the breathing and eyening equipment, and the other was seen as a cornet with ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashions, you're lucky.
The fashion designers predict that they'll cover hugely the store near you.
The large blocks follow closely "La Bombi", a broken block with a 60-centimetre end was observed among others on Rihanni and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult symbol for an extremely inflexible block of social networks was another great creation after the fashion bridge — a broken beach bag that was almost as large as a manicin in the trunks she wore.
The bag from Rafia in a hot orange color, dressed with rafflese resins and with a hand from white lips, was in the Paris week's middle hair collection La Riviera was designed by Jacquemusa for spring/ summer 2019.
The famous style of Luke Armitage told the FCCC: "I hope that large beaches and beach bags will be brought into the store for the next summer – since the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be necessary to stop after too many additions."
John Edward: Language knowledge is a key factor for global citizens
Scottish schools enjoy words of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with only a few exceptional results on studies that still strengthen individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland who are represented by the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS), they are trying to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Self-employed schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, chosen a career course and a place that they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can shape and implement an adjusted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in the language he understands, he will be impressed.
But if you talk to a man in his mother's tongue, his words will touch his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely entirely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The annual results of recent studies show that languages at the top of the school are at the highest levels of success in self-esteem schools.
68 percent of the students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a great deal.
The data collected in the 74 schools of the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS) showed that 72% of students reached a high level of assessment in the Mandarinian region and 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students were also highly evaluated.
This proves that Swedish schools support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as selection items in the study plans of self-esteem schools and others as objects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A study carried out by the Commission for Employment and Training in the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that for reasons why workers are suffering in order to fill their jobs, 17 per cent are attributed to the lack of knowledge of languages.
Thus, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
These skills are essential in the global world for future employment, which requires knowledge of languages.
If someone learns another language, he has a great privilege in the future regardless of the professional course he has chosen, with such experience.
A majority of people who can directly agree with people from foreign countries have an automatic advantage in the face of competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, while French was the only language spoken by the bilingual percentage of respondents, which is 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to learning the language is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools vary in languages taught in Scotland.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others are learning languages that would be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, you will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field.
Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it is not possible to forget that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so it must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Schools Council
LeBron will be Debt in Lakers' dress in San Diego every week
For worshipers who rejoice in LeBron James' first appearance of the Los Angeles Lakers, the waiting will soon be over.
Coach Lakers' Luke Walton announced that James would play in a week's leading game against the Duke of Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn't know how long he'll be playing.
"More than one and less than 48," explains Walton at the Lakers website.
The official reporter of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably be playing for a few minutes.
After training early this week, James asked about his plans for the sixth Lakers season before the season.
"At this stage I do not need my preparatory career before the season," he said.
Corps collection in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia is starting a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of the five planned meetings planned in the following week, including the arrivals in its host countries, between the other Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free seat at the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wishes to receive support for the upcoming inter-voting elections, as the Republicans are threatened by losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will it take to assemble Trump in West Virginia and where will you be able to see him online?
The trumpet will be held in Wheeling in West Virginia on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 1 p.m. after sunrise.
In West Virginia, you can watch a live crowd online on the YouTube channel.
The trumpet will probably be talking about hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense because of sexual harassment charges, which is why the signature in the Senate is expected to be postponed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans who are awaiting important elections in November to get a new start.
That is why, in the campaign of President Trump, these five meetings were designed "to encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of those who have it in the Senate and the House, Reuters reports.
"The control of the Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the campaign season as possible," told the representative of the Trump campaign, which does not want to be named.
Today's gathering at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling would also be attended by supporters from Ohia and Pennsylvania following the report of West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract interest in the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia in the last month, where it received more than 40 per cent points in 2016.
The trumpet is trying to help a Republican candidate for a Senate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
"For Morrisey it is a bad sign that the president must come and "take him up" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryderev's family 2018: the US team is still looking forward to winning and keeping hope before the weekly individual double
After three solo games, there may have been the right Saturday afternoon doubles (foursome) what Ryder's last year needed.
Although no sport concept has ever been devised, players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where'd it go now?
"They had six advantages, but now they have four, so it's probably a new job for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a priority because it leads to four points, and it can still be achieved by twelve.
But after Spieth’s words, the Americans felt that they had wind in their stomachs, and among other things, they were encouraged by the shape of Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points of four.
Spieth was injured from the initial hit to the green and set a good example.
The cry of luck continued to become more louder and led to a decisive hit when Thomas, after a stay with two points, ended up in the fourth game.
The attack that won them on November 15th was prepared with a similar scream, such as to let you know that we believe that the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for this player.
18 Lukes to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's funeral.
It is unusual, but the desperate two of Europes have won four points from the four points and are inexhaustible.
The two ‘Mollwood’ was the only one who didn’t hit the buggy on Saturday morning, but also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine o’clock on Friday morning.
Such a game and a way in which the energy gap between them and the native population is apparently confirmed by the fact that there are those players who will have to win it on Sunday, and no other player would be better able to secure Europe's potential winnings like Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Well, it's possible both at the same time on different holes.
But talking about European glory would be too much.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly won Serge Garcio, the morning hero in the game with four joggs, who was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the bungies and two double bungies on the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they didn't find their way out.
And on Saturday, players won't have any help.
Games with four pairs and two pairs are extremely interesting to follow from close to the communication between the couple, the advice they give them, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than a team and has had a great advantage before the last day, but two of them have shown that the U.S. team also wants to win, something that some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's funeral
Europe's last day of Ryder's race is a good priority after Saturday's games with four pairs of shoes and two pairs of water with 10:6 against the United States.
The great couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave everything from himself and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at the Le Golf National game, he took four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, who is trying to win the trophie she lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had in the morning games with four jogs of power over the American team that was wrong and put it in line with 3:1.
The U.S. team got better at two doubles where they won two games, but the rest couldn't do it.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from the 12 weekly individual battles if they want to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood was the first European journalist who won four consecutive points while they were with Molinaria (a couple named "Mollwood") after the sensual end of the week only another couple who won four points in their first four games in Ryder's history.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four jogs, they again appeared and were even more confident of winning the lost Woods and the American newspaper Bryson Dechambeauja with 5 and 4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, at the moment showed his brightness, but he lost 19 of 29 games in two games with four pairs and two pairs of two, from this seven series.
Justin Rose, who was at the beginning of the morning game with four jogs, returned for two and two pairs of pairs with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were placed in the first and third place on the world stage.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything was not going along the European team's plans.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, she won a decisive victory against Spain Jona Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four jogs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 and 3 in two, with the first two holes lost.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after the rest of the four points before the individual doubt, although Fury's team only needs to be eliminated to keep the trophies safe.
But after two days on the other side of the road, the week - long resistance may seem too much for her.
North Korea: "Without confidence, we will never break up unilaterally"
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued enforcement of sanctions would lead to growing mistrust in the United States of America and that North Korea would certainly not renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea has adopted a number of "significant measures in a good mood" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, nuclear testing infrastructure and the promise that nuclear weapons and technology will not be spread.
"However, we do not see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, we will not be convinced in state security and under such conditions we will never be able to get a uniform first divorce."
While Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to the process of nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of procedural measures, its statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjong had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader who took place in Singapore on 12 June. At that time Kim committed himself to "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while the North Korea Tromp promised security.
North Korea wants the official end of the Korean war which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States acted that Pyongyang must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not extend the invitation to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“SECTION is being held up by the fact that we must first be nuclear-disarmed, and pressure on sanctions to achieve their objectives by force, and in addition to this, the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“In the opinion that sanctions could put us on knees, it is a unrealistic hope of people who don’t even know us.
The problem is that the continued enforcement of sanctions still undermines our confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kimmo and Trumpo, which was presented by the President of the United Nations at the beginning of the week by the US President.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kimmo and South Korean President Mun J. Inom, who took place in the past five months, adding: "If we had to talk to South Korea about nuclear disarmament rather than the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a dead point."
However, the tone of Rijjega's speech was quite different from that of the year when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that an attack on the U.S. cell part of North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump Kima marked "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea, commended Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations Assembly, but said that he was still expected to do much more and that the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea nuclearly dissolved.
In the middle, Trump said that this was not a planned time frame, and in this he said: ‘It may take two years, three years or five months – that is not important.’
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, in the fourth U.S. State Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the UN Security Council, he said: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Rij at the time of the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said that Pjongjang would visit again next month for preparation for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not well over.
When July left Pjongjang, he said it had come to progress, and North Korea had already criticised him within hours, so that his demands would be "gangster".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Munna, which took place this month, to become a test rocket and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States would take "the appropriate measures".
Mr Munu should say that ‘appropriate measures’ meant security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students visit the course they are learning how to take enough time to relax
The goal of the new annual course at Harvard University is to teach all the university students how to get more sleep. With this course they want to fight against the growing artistic culture of "cell evening" learning, where powers are gathered with caffeine.
A university professor noted that students of the world’s best universities often do not know the basis for their care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist in the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that was the first such in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of pay on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said: ‘Why do I do this only now when I am in the last year?’
She said no one yet told her how important the spy was, and for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course they take this year for the first time is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general good feelings.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University of Health Services, says that they decided to do so when they found that the student was seriously missing from Spain during the week.
The enormity course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the student's door where students can click on coffee bars, covers, sports shoes and books to get information on the effects of caffeine and light, lack of tension on sports success and the importance of regular routine.
In the second section, however, participants report that long-term lack of spinal cord may increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student residence with interactive icons encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
And we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
Professor says that the culture of pride at "living lifelong learning" is still present. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, as a result of lack of Spanish, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient quantity of quality spaghetti should be "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also be avoided by gaining weight – brains due to lack of spaghetti are easily passed through, which makes the students extremely easy.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop a course. Lani participated in a professor's lecture during his first year in Harvard.
He says that his transmission opened his eyes and encouraged him to carry out the course throughout the student village.
It is hoped that in the next phase students will be able to request a similar study programme before entering into a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students continue to wake up to sleep as well as awakening. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of ‘modes of light’ that give it electronic vision and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalances of the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with zedek hit up Gerard's team
Rangers Reconnaissanced in Guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston announced team Steven Gerard condemned defeat with 1 :0.
The team from Ibrox hit its first host victory after the February ruling at St. Johnstone stadium with 4 : 1, but the team of Gary Holta gave her a second victory in 18 matches, since it was headed by the Gerard team, with his team leading the Scottish League team remaining 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the start of the first half, and the chosen kind of Rangers didn't give any impression that he wanted to eliminate it.
With this, Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston progressed to a third place, but with different heads left the Hibernian team.
The problem with Rangers was not over yet. Callum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered head injury when he reported out an object from the city of the cheerleading team.
Gerard was in a team that won Ayr without a problem and was assigned to the semifinal of the Betfred Cup. He made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt kept his verified Livingstone Austere, which had taken off the Hearts team a week earlier, and was no doubt inspired by the effective neutralization of all the guests' attempts by his team.
The Rangers had a higher possession of yokes, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga, with the first short presentation, found Scott Pittman, then went to Allan McGregor's cave, but the driver was uncertain and missed the opportunity.
A long-lost shot by Keaghan Jacobss later reached Captain Craig Halketta, but he was later shot by his defence assistant Alan Lithgow failed to make it into a hole.
In the last third, Rangers took control of the game, but the game showed more hope than real desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after a 15-minute race with Steven Lawless there should be a criminal shot, but Judge Steven Thomson's claim was shot in the car.
The Rangers was able to produce only two shots at the goal for the first time, but he didn't shoot with his head that sent Lassana Coulibally against the goal, nor did the yellow Ovie Ejariya's little girl, nothing for Liam Kelly's door, presented any danger.
Livingstone's initial goal at 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but he was already fully deserved for sustainability.
Ranksor has failed to predict another Jacob's long-term course.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took it to Scott Robinson, who prepared Mengi routinely for a simple closure of the attack.
Gerard took action, and during the holiday Coulibaly replaced with a wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with the Morelos, but Kelly effectively flew out of his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his work and forced the guests into his game, where both Lithgow and Halkett provided more information in front of the goal.
The Holt team could still increase its leadership against the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unaware of the data from the cat.
At Rangerssey Glenn Middleton won the chance of a criminal shooting after meeting Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't recognize him.
Almanah: Immigrant of Geigerje's Number
We represent a party from the German side of our weekly issues: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of devices called Geiger's number.
He became a star in the scientific world, and he also got his place in pop culture, says in the 1950 movie Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played Cavbojs:
Men: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's number. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you find a audience, you can hear the effect it has on atomic radioactivity in materials."
Evans: "Madonca, now they're really advertising! "
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
And Isoum with his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can be identified by the immune system
A new anti-cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to recognize and destroy aggressive cells
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize aggressive cells
This method includes the acquisition of immunodeficiency cells of patients who have subsequently changed to the laboratory
They may then ‘see’ the protein that is characteristic of numerous forms of cancer and then return to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancer diseases.
In one of the women who received vaccines that the immune system is learning to recognize aggressive cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of the immune cells of patients who change them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ the Her2 protein, which is significant for a number of forms of cancer and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 'incentives the growth of various types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fats.
A similar approach to achieving the immune cells of patients who ‘learn’ to target cancer cells has also been effective in the treatment of leukemia.

Kanye West was highlighted in the study of Saturday Night Live's presentation at an amazing point in which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trumpu, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidential chair.
At the end of his third song, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a capo with the title "Make America Great Again", West began with an attack on democracy and once again expressed its support for Trump.
"It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump because he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago," he says.
This SNL award began with a family with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood player sacrificed himself from Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony to the Commission of Justice at the Senate, where Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault.
The team of West monologues was not predicated, and it was put into a social network by a comic book named Chris Rock.
It's not known whether Rock was going to fuck with it from the West.
The West also accused the public of having some problems in the backyard because of writing on the hat.
"For the funeral, they made their way to me.
They told me ‘ don’t go to or from the head. ’
I'm under arrest!
They say I'm lost," said the Washington Examiner after the report.
The West continued: "Do you want to see a lost scene?" and added that you must trust "Superman's wrath, because it means that no one can show me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were at least twice prepared by the public for the celebration, and the SNL team members were in obvious danger, and someone told Vanity: "The study was a death silence."
The West was invited to the replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West has already caused a lot of surprise by videotape for the song "I Love it" where he wore a glass of mineral water marks Perrier.
West supported Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the most important souls: Thank you for being UPRL RAJI."
The talk director of Karen Hunter complained that the West is simply "what it is, and that's clear.
However, I will not reward someone (by buying his music, wearing or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so did I.
Before the release, the rapper on Twitter announced that you have changed his name and will later "winner, formally known as Kanye West. I am now YE."
He's not the first singer who decided to change his name, but he did it before, and he's known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
His local colleague Snoop Dogg once named Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince has changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an Artist once known as Prince.

The accused must be brought before the Tribunal in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
The Star Game of the Kit Harington Tables Strong Against Toxic Males
Kit Harrington is known for his victory of the sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medium-coloured fantasy series Game chairs.
A 31-year-old player who has severely condemned the stereotype of a mastistic hero says that because of such involvement in young boys who are underprivileged, they often feel that they can only deserve respect.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic men during the movement #JazTudi.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old soigralist from the Rose Leslie Round Game admitted that he had strong conviction about this subject.
"I am currently asking myself seriously where we have made a mistake when it comes to men," he said.
"What have we learned from growing up to men about the problems we now face?"
Kit thinks that television is partly responsible for increasing toxicity by showing very powerful people.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
When they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose the right amount of male wages?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change it?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series the following summer he would not be involved in the recording of any talks or the continuation of the Games because he "closed the battlefields and horses".
Kit will play in November in the main role of the new presentation of the Show of True West Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother a thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game of the throne was that he met his wife Rose on the tape.
"For this series I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on," he said.
Rose's in a fantasy series, won with Emmy, played Ygrette, a love choice of Kitto's character, Jon Snow.
A couple were married in June 2018 at the presence of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: with a Chinese report on 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In most of the new cases, the disease has been passed on to sexual relations, which represents a change compared to the past.
The HIV virus has usually spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to data from the Chinese health officials from the Junean conference, the number of people infected with HIV in such a way decreased almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a very serious problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against persons from the LGBT community is still very present.
Since conservative values are still in force in the country, 70–90% of men who have sexual relations with men are currently married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate sexual protection under such circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general access to HIV therapy as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters is alleged to have issued data on Republican senators, including "hazardous lies" and "harvest theories"
The US Congress of Maxine Waters objected on Saturday that a member of her staff had published information on three U.S. Republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles have confirmed that these charges are coming from individuals and websites of the right-wing right.
"Ladies, lies and more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information published below includes domestic titles and telephone numbers of Utah United States senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
These data were published online on Thursday, by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the session of the Senate on the charges of sexual harassment of a candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Kanaugh.
Information was received after the three senators closed with the Kavanaugh hearing.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that via the IP title it is possible to recognize the source of the publication that should be linked to the office Senator Waters and conclude that information has been published by one of the staff, reports Hill.
‘These unfounded charges are completely wrong and pure lies’ continues Waters.
‘My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges are not at all responsible for the collection of these data.
These unfounded charges are completely false and pure.’
Senator Waters' statement quickly came up with criticism online, including by former representative of the White House for the press, Aria Flecher.
"From this loss of anger," Fleisher wrote.
‘This may mean that it is not from the correct test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't show up.
We can't stand up.
And we must not doubt the cause of the one who accused him.
Stay calm.’
Fleisher compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters City at inter-voting elections, announced via Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
In her statement, Watersova stated that her office announced "the relevant institutions and bodies of trafficking in relation to these false charges.
"We will ensure that the workers are discovered," she continued, "and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to everyone."
Johnny English again in stock - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for targets at Brexit in any new British film has become traditional and also applies to the restoration of the Johnny English stock comedy, which was first published in 2003 with the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satirate about how we're ruined, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetence Johnny English, with the eyes of the blind and the unusual grismas, obtained permission to re-transmit the tears; his name indicates that he is a comical figure created for a cinematographic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It's about an unborn secret agent who, despite his extraordinary movement, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Beana's cancer and the minority of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It's also based on the traveler and the international secret boy Atkinson once played at the now forgotten TV advertising for Barclaycard, which he left for himself with the real chaos.
In the latest film, one or two nice moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English drew near to the helicopter, wore a middle cover, and terrorist lists hung around his head for a short time.
Atkinson's comedy gift is clearly displayed, but humor seems to be a few blogs and too unnecessary, especially since "real" films such as 007 or Mission cannot now offer comic items without bad news.
It appears that humor is intended for children and not so much adult viewers, so for me to reject Johnny English events are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's role does not match Mr. Bean's role.
The constant theme is now clearly that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker has infiltrated the network of the British's most secret agents and has exposed the identity of all British agents, which has caused great problems to the competent agent represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprising little role.
This is a point too much for a prime minister, a posthumously figure that has already experienced evil because of political intolerance: Emma Thompson has been trying with the role of suspect Teresa May, but there is nothing acceptable in the scenario, with which he could help.
The intelligence service shall inform it that all active wagons are detected and must therefore be decided for one of the abandoned wagons.
And that means Johnna English, now a teacher at college who is not officially teaching how to work under the crown: there are scenarios, because English is implementing a certain Vohuntic "rock Academy".
The English are taking to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where they meet with a long-term partner, Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, a stereotyped sports enthusiast, the role Vicki Pepperdine has lost a little.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Majesty, and they meet the mortal Ophelio Bullett, who plays Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is evil Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough tell their dress: dressed in a blazed fire in the French restaurant, creates chaos when the top of Volt's jacket is overheated, and when English tries to use glasses for obvious reality to get to know Volt's interior, he succeeds in creating general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, in spite of the sensitivity and energy of the child film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films I can't help and think about: is the British film Atkinson capable of playing a role that really justifies his talent?
The labs fail to plan a four-day work week for Britain, which would pay for a five-day work week.
Laborist partner Jeremy Corbina is thinking of a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payout.
A company's leading party wants the savings created by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to be transferred to workers and allow them to add a day-to-day.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high pay.
The sources say that the idea is consistent with the party's economic plan and the plan to put the State on the side of workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the advantages of changing economies.
A source from the Laborist Party for The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen during the night, but the forty-four-year-old is the goal we will strive to achieve with the customer's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The labist party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the 48th working week in its campaign in the general elections in 2017 was supported by the Green Party.
This objective is currently not supported by the Laborist Party as a whole.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: "The Thursday work week is not a party's policy and a party's policy does not think about it."
Cancler in the shadow of John McDonnell used a laboratory conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that it was decided to expel the power of 'free' and 'best' in municipal companies.
The plans of the sunflower can also mean that current participants in the water companies may no longer receive the full share, as the laboratory party could introduce ‘debts’ on the basis of the alleged errors.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the Management Board and to introduce Own Inclusion Funds, with a view to transferring 10 per cent of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed the 60-minute "60-minute" issue of whether they could change their opinion of the Kavanaugh survey conducted by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh, which is conducted by the FBI, has raised the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the authorities of any Republican senator could be persuaded to withdraw their support from the judge.
In an interview that was delivered on Sunday, the "60-minute" reporter of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that would change his opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than a South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before I started hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this charge appeared, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’
He was determined, unmovable, unambiguous.’
And Graham's voice seems to be stuck in the rock.
"I have created my opinion about Brit Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett was definitely missing, ” adds Graham, quoted by Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those whom she named could confirm this.
It's 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes.’
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, the annual musical event where a truly remarkable kind of star has the same excellent mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this time of the week, will be attended by dozens of people. They will sit together on the Grand Shrine of the Central Park not only in order to enjoy the events of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also in order to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Citizens' Project, an international trade union group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a simple event entry (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a sort of task or "action" such as volunteers, letters to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way of raising awareness about their objective of eliminating poverty.
How successful is Global Citizen movement, which has been in its pursuit for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called "clivism" — to make sure that people are actually affected by online petition or tweeting?
Gibanje Global Citizen points out that more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters should have been noted since 2011.
It is said that these actions have helped the world leader in the adoption of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which would affect life by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
By 2018 the group indicated that the fruit of its 390 commitments and communications, which were already paid or collected at least US$ 10 billion, should be the result of its actions.
The group estimates that the funds collected have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and decision-makers who are committed to "help to achieve their full potential" promised by Rwanda in order to help eliminate conservation after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can fix the social crime of conservation in the historical archives," said many at a concert in London in April 2018 by Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Partnership of the Power of Prehrane.
The group also acted that the government, following more than 5,000 actions taken by the United Kingdom, called for the improvement of food for mothers and children, announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The movement of the Global citizen replied: "This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as with the great movement of civil rights and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among the performers who will take place on the annual event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be conducted by Debora-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy – the US Ministry of Internal Affairs for the "blockage" of Russian energy exports
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke should say after reporting the Washington Examiner magazine that Washington could use marineco to prevent the Russian energy market, among others in the Middle East.
Zinke said that the Russian media in Syria (to be warned that the government should be invited) to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that their presence in the Middle East is a reason for their desire for energy market, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he should say.
However, officials believe there are ways and means to cope with this.
"The United States can fight this. Marines ensure that our maritime routes are open and block them as necessary, thus preventing Russian energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group known as the ‘Volume of Energy Consumers’ in the United States.
He applied Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually equal.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less affected by fuel and their replacement," he said, pointing out that Russia has a 'pony known as one trick', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at the time of trying to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe by the authorities of Trump, where Russia would be forced to make a much more expensive choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Government of Trump, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "inappropriate" gas project North River 2, which should be behind the Berlin "talec" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North River 2 is worth 11 billion dollars, which would double the existing gas capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, except an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same position that energy should not be a tool for carrying out pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a September meeting with the American Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), has called on the United States not to take part in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Engaging a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me," said Mr. Angelo Merkel, a recent meeting between German Chancellor and Russian President Vladimir Putin by Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industry Union (BDI).
Elizabeth Warren will "examine closely" her candidate in the elections for the American President in 2020, true Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren worked on Saturday to "examine closely" his candidate for the US president after interlocutory elections.
In the city house of Hollyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think about the candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which requires women's leaders," said the newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a closer look at my candidate for the President."
Warren won a meeting at the local house by President Donald Trumpa, for "this country would lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is very worried about me," she said.
Warren's troops and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh have already been publicly criticised several times.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
The survey published on Thursday showed that most of her own voters believed that Warren in 2020 should not be challenged for the position of the president.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, the senator should not apply for president, 18% of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidate.
The survey showed that there was more support for the candidate than ever before by Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of the respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposed it.
The second high-level Democrats who would take into account the candidacy of the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to the Associated Press agency, Mr Bean said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin referred to the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palina in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, survived this year in Iraq after entering the army.
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“Because my own son, who lives after his return, has contacted me with other families who are facing post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain measure of injuries our soldiers are returning with,” he told the municipality according to the support of Donald Trump in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
Palinov's son's arrest marked a "silence in the hall" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning several changes, arguing where it was respected for what the Soviets and aircraft and all the other members of the military had given to the States."
The Palina Track was arrested on Monday in the part of Vasilla in Aljaski and charged with violence in families with female assaults, with a ban on family violence and possession of weapons in the criminal state, said Dan Bennett, a police officer in Vasili.
18 Federal Countries and Districts of Colombia support the dedication of the new asylum policy
Eighty federal states and the Colombia District support the legal challenge of the new American policy that victims of violence or domestic violence are entitled to asylum.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the above-mentioned environment had completed a court hearing on Friday to support the policy challenge.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Association has submitted against federal policy, has not been published.
She felt that her partner and her "his sons, members of the mob", had violated her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
They caught her in Texas.
State prosecutors of the federal states that support Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are coming in the United States, as countries that are suddenly confronted with problems with torture and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new asylum policy of the United States rejected the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Calling Unmarked Immigrants, who had fled from family violence, allowed an asylum application to be submitted.
The state prosecutor of the District of Colombia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "presumes the decade of state, federal and international law."
‘The binding law requires that all claims for asylum be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the claim and that such prohibition violates this principle,’ the application submitted to the court states.
The State prosecutors further stated in the request that the policy that immigrants are deprived of their right to access is detrimental to the US economy, as it would probably be more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour force".
The General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has decided that in June no more asylum should be given to victims fleeing from domestic violence and violence.
‘Azil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in individual social groups or political opinions,’ said Sessions 11 June in its policy publication.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but there are complex attempts to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling was very intense,” said 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, when she asked her warm boyfriend to stay at the evacuation center in Pala.
"The rescuers carry the body continuously.
It lacks clean water.’
There were cities, returning to destroyed homes that had been destroyed through overcrowded goods and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that destroyed 7.5 percent of the population were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harisa, who suffered back and shoulders injury, were healed by the military hospitals in Palu, where patients were treated free because of persistent serious medical problems.
When he recalled the violent earthquake that hit the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was raised with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There's no time to get rid of it.
I think I've been impressed by the damage to the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he was with his family in town for marriage.
"I heard a woman calling for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China's "delegation" with "propagandistic advertising"
One week after the publication of a four-month notice of the official Chinese magazine in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuse of American press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last week about the payout supplement of China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the federal state of Iowa, after China accused of involvement in the American Congress of November 6th, as China disappeared.
The Reuters Agency reported that U.S. federal officials accused Trump of attempting to intervene in the US federal elections described as a new phase in Washington's more intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion declarations, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in the more intensive trade war in which they have exchanged attacks by introducing customs duties on imported products.
The Chinese refund rates at the beginning of the trade war should be affected by exporters in the United States, such as Iowa, which supports the Republican Party of Trump, by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had attacked American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "Now this submission is underway with the publication of propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has used an appreciated American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid announcement in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of views that Chinese citizens have about worrying Chinese economic paths, as the city is closely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese magazines rejected the offer for publication" of his article, although he did not mention it.
Republicans lose their elections before interlocutory conflicts with Kawanaug, warning analysts
Analysts warn that the support of a number of the most important republicans who support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, despite more allegations of sexual assault, will be recognized in the coming interlocutory conflicts with the loss of the vote.
The feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already acted as they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of polithology at Maxwell University in Sirakuzah for a study published on Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher said that there is no doubt that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI will be sufficient to calm angry voters at the last moment.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progress group MoveOn on Friday, following the report of journalist Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors shouted "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when the Republicans, who were the presiding judge of the judicial committee, decided to continue support Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the newspaper portal Mic.
"The air and motivation of the Democrats will cross all borders," said the journalist Stu Rothenberg, a non-participative political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and they keep it.
However, it could be even stronger, especially among undefined voters in areas and smaller voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the President but who do not like him often."
Even before Ford's public talk, in which he described in detail his complaints about the sexual assault of a high court candidate, analysts had said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
"This has become a big mistake for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after reporting the NBC News agency in the beginning of last week.
"It is not only about the vote of the world or the final vote or the promise of Kavanaugh; it is also about how the Republicans agree with it and how Fordvo was treated," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Group of Priorities, who supports democracy in the conflicts.
And the Americans seem to be a few divided by this, or more likely to believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's story, while a few more support them later.
The New YouGov survey says that 41 percent of respondents are sure or believe the Ford story, and 35 percent have done so to ensure or trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of them felt that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during the talk, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Fordova said the previous week before the Senate, under oath, that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez’s claim was that she was shown sex while she was at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The founder of the global network is planning to start a new internet to meet with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the global network, is opening up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' open-source solid platforms.
Solid users can choose where their data are stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was "to rule the world".
"We decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"Game for a historical moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology which allows users to create a "special database for data storage" or a POD
This may include contact information, schedules, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's similar as if there were Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specific feature of the personal database for data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
This company is called "special capacity-building with data".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of combining the resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow everyone to access the Solid platform.
The companies are currently forming a safety platform for Berners-Lee, Bruce, purchased by IBM, some of the less experienced developers for work on the project and the community of volunteers' programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Googlom are not talking about whether they could bring about a complete change that could remove all their business models during the night."
"Don't ask them for permission."
In a press release on the Media portal on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt aims to "ensure commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee reviewed the Internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium Institute for Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic with regard to the coming years of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Victorian cross from World War I
In the home city for 100 years they have celebrated the victory of the church of England’s only priest, who had received him as a fighter in the first world war.
Honourable Colonel Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a gunman, so he never realized that he had been given the highest honor of the British military.
On Saturday, two Colonels discovered a monumental stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone was discovered 100 years after the grandfather's action with which he was responsible.
According to the report of the newspaper London Gazette, Colonel Vann conducted his battle on September 29, 1918 through the Canal of Saint Quintina "through very very very close fog and under the powerful fire of war field and machinery."
Later, he planned against the firing squad and led the "greatest union" ahead, and then I attacked the machine and assigned three members.
Colonel Vanna, on 4 October 2018 – just a good month before the end of the war – shot a German shooter.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father's actions were "something I know and could never reach, so teach me humility."
With his brother, Dr. James Vanna, they were on the parade that led by the honor of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, also placed a venetian.
Michael Vann said to feel "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise," and "that the courage of the real hero is reflected in the support that many people will say."
The airships over mixed combat skills were noticed all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puse Pepe.
Imagine: All night you noticed that you were looking at a fully distributed Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose was attended by 13 suspects, including six in the main park, and was transferred to the United Kingdom alive on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to prepare, observers in the United Kingdom found that the transfer was replaced by the presentation of the Puys Pepa rice.
Marcido wasn't really excited because he was awake until morning due to doubt.
One of the demonstrators described on Twitter the shift to a child's rice as "some kind of painful joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m. and therefore had to be converted into a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Belator organisation for marketing and communication when asked about transmission.
"A lot of Popes."
The president of the Belator organisation, Scott Cooker, said they were trying to adjust the watch by including future observers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about rehearsal, I think we can do it," said Cooker.
"But then there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to do this until Sunday after our time or Sunday after them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me that a number of messages have been changed during the shift and that not everyone was friendly.
We tried to settle the matter; we thought it was just a technical mistake.
However, there was a real reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you this will not happen again next time.
Instead of the six we're going to have five doubles – as usual. We've been trying to offer more than expected and we're counting on it.
It is a very unappreciative situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "unworthy" about sex.
Olympic counterpart Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation he felt inferior to everyone – but it gave him reason for success.
The 24-year-old said that it was "not everyone as much as he was" when he entered high school.
In his first address to the Desert Island Discs, which was for radio station Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give another "trust".
He also said that when he became an elder, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
The regular director of a long-term commitment, Kirsty Young, was absent because of a multimonth illness.
Daley, who appeared as an excommunicator in Laverne's first presentation, said that he felt as “lower” than everyone else, because “it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls.”
He said: "To this day, this feeling of inferiority and diversity is a real thing that gives me the strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said that he would not be disappointed by anyone who would finally make his point.
A two-time Olympic Championshiper has become an influential LGBT lawyer and has appeared twice this year at the National Community Games in Australia in order to call on States to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could talk openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others a "hope".
The three-time world leader said that he was a novelist with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – "surprised."
Daley has been reporting with a 20-year-old complainant, but he says that the difference in years has never been a problem.
‘When you’re so young’ – at the age of 14, he participated in the first Olympic games and his father died three years later – he said, it was difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar heights and fall.
A couple adopted a child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says he changed his "wide view" with this.
"If you asked me about the French year, there would be everything I should say that I must get a gold medal," he said.
"But, you know, in the world things are bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of cancer in the brain.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had an entry for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first place.
I couldn't say to him, "You won't be in the first place, Father," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead, I had to finally admit that he wasn't harmless," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and achieved a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – going down to the Olympic Games in front of my home municipality. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This was also inspired by his first choice of songs – Proud singer Heather Small, who followed him in preparation for the Olympic Games and where his skin is still wet.
They deliver Desert Island Discs at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson took over Saturday Ryder's seat
American Phil Mickelson will be back on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Valley, but he will have to return in order not to become an unhappy border.
Mickelson, who will be involved in the binary event for 12-year-olds, has already allowed Captain Furyk to sit on Saturday's Thursdays.
Instead of being in the middle of an event as often as it was for the United States, the winner five times spent his day in part as a cheerleader and as part of improving his game in order to fix his weight.
In view of the fact that even at the top of the career he did not measure the best course, the 48-year-old does not match the most serious Le Golf National game, where long-term legend inevitably punishes wrong hits.
And if only the game wouldn't be scary enough, Mickelson will have a match with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinary, who was in the rush to win all four games this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have 12 individual games at the beginning of less than four games, had started well, it could have been shown to be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say enough.
"He fully understood the role he had today, used me on his back and held me by his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's so much confidence in you.
It was one of the most famous and in the past, and it was also extremely useful for teams this week.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I've represented you more, but that's what happened, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to play as much as everybody does.’
Mickelson will record Nick Falda for the largest number played during the Ryder Cup event on Sunday.
With this, he could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which he never really liked with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 victories and seven defeats, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"It's fun, sarcastizing, breathing, it's a work of nut from people and it's great to have it in the team space," he explained.
"I think young players were having fun when they moved with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives more than just a game.’
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon fall
From experience, European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that an important priority can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride at the beginning of the last few days.
Young Danec Debated in 1997 at the Valderrame game, where the party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five priority points before the Americans, and through the goal she moved only with hair priority, resulting in 1411⁄2-131/2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won but rarely," Bjorn (on the picture) said in view of the team Class of 2018 who won from 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and pointed to the Le Golf National game with 10-6.
So the story of me and everyone in the team says she hasn't finished.
Tomorrow play full.
Go and do everything you need.
It's not over until it's written on the table.
We have a goal to win this prize, and we must remain focused on it.
I've been focusing all the time on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited about the game of his players at the required game, Bjorn added: “I would never have been here too fast.
It'll be a different day tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be in front of the individual game, so this will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have partners when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golfer's abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you have to deliver to the player: Tomorrow you have to pull out the best.
Now let your partner for you, and he must draw out the best from you."
In contrast with Bjorna, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who reached three out of four points.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the last day's shift, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a winner when Europe launched the "Church in Medina".
"I remember every word you read," he answered, when asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
"In the morning we have 12 important courses, but we would start working as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this move gets endurance, it's a strong pressure on the middle game.
We created a proper setting and put the boys in a way until we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.’
Thomas was assigned to try to fight and meet Rory McIllroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the second Europeans in the upper half of the class order.
"In this group of boys, I decided for this sort of order, because I think it covers all the schedules," Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
A new German warship is repatriated
The latest German Navy fleet should be deployed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the cold war, but local cities will not be reported due to the collapse of systems and rapid growth costs by the following year.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the new class Fregat Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now translated into the first half of 2019, says journalist Die Zeit, who mentions the military representative.
The ship should join mariners in 2014, but the ambitious project poses concerns after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, commissioned in 2007, will be replaced by the old Bremen Fregat class.
It is expected that they will have a strong top, type of anti-pital and anti-tial explosions and some covering technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include further distances between maintenance – the latest cargo could remain outside the domestic port for up to two years.
However, continued delays mean that the upper military vessels that would allow Germany to influence the trans sea also, until the start of its use, are already old, says journalist Die Ziet.
The F125 F125 accident occurred on the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
At that time it happened first that the mariner returned to the shipyard after supply.
There are only a few known reasons for the return, but the German municipality has mentioned a number of key "software and technical deficiencies" which would make the warship useless if it had been sent to the war mission.
The lack of programme equipment was particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertemberg crew would manage a team of about 120 sailors – only half of the working force on the old Bremen's flagships.
It has also been shown that the ship is a major challenge, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibilities of seafarers for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tonship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ should be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project has also become a problem – including training teams.
This would achieve a turnover of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) from the start of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest flagships are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that sailors "are actually missing ships suitable for the trip."
The officer said that the question of time had been raised because the old ships had been destroyed and the replacement ships had not been provided.
He regretted that the sailors could not join any of the Baden-Wuertemberg ships.
The National Fund belongs to the secret life of non-tempiricals
New research is being carried out at the presence of Scotland's highest level, in which they are trying to find out how non-metapyrites are used for food.
They hope that the results will reflect on the conduct of these unique flight crews and will help to focus on future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small and small non-metagrass and rheumatic soil and soils at the Inverwe Gardens presence in the Western Ross area.
In key sites, special observers will be set up to monitor the activity of non-topirses throughout the entire season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The technical sound analysis of all effects will confirm the frequency of netopyrides calls and what kind of action they take.
Then they will prepare a local map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most suitable for non-metals and how they are used by each individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for non-fouling and other species of family.
The number of non-tariff populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined dramatically in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and loss of habitat.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as molluscs and some types of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Netopirs aren't really blind.
Because of the night's practice of hunting, you're better able to help with the catch than with your eyes.
For the exact determination of error and obstacle on the way of the year, pre-defined techniques shall be used.
NTSC, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, is taking very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspection of shelters and temporary solutions.
The organization has set up the first and now the only Scottish reserve, especially intended for non-tempirical purposes, at the presence of Drave in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The owner of the property of David Thompson says its possession is an ideal area.
"We have a great area for non-territory," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still much more knowledge about those who are not well-known, so the work we do here and at other events will help us to understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of non-metallics prior to the execution of maintenance parts on the holdings, as the possible sudden destruction of one family of non-metallics could result in the death of up to 400 Sami and young people, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
The Netopirs are protected, so they are forbidden to be killed, tortured or tortured, and also forbidden to destroy their relatives.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Non-Terror Reserve, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our non-temples and for many species we simply don't know how their populations behave well."
Ronaldo refuses the charges of violence, and lawyers are preparing for a complaint from the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo was accused of violence that he should be wrong, marked for "false news" and said that people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to file a German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus complained that in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas, they had raped the US with the name of Kathryn Mayorg.
Dr Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay 375.000 dollars for the event for the dark.
In the event of the arrest of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, noted for "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," said the fifth-time gold miner in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everyone well," added the smiling player.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing for a complaint by Der Spiegel, after reporting by the Reuters agency, for complaints referred to as "unacceptable report on sums of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for "incapacitated damage to the amount corresponding to the actual infringement which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The local incident should take place in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted at the District Court of Clark in Nevada, she was to return to the playroom after the meeting at the Mayorga Night Club with Ronald, and she should be encouraged there.
Majorga says that after that incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and said he was "99% good man", which only disappoints in "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described him as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, and later she agreed to extrajudicial treatment because she was "severely afraid of punishment" and worried about "public humiliation".
34-year-olds claim that he wants to break up the settlement because he's still having a serious trauma due to the suspect incident.
Ronaldo was only in the time of a suspicious attack just prior to the crossing from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this flight, worth $100 million, moved to the Italian capital Juventus.
Brexite: United Kingdom 'would always complain' loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always complain" if after a break it would lose the status of the leading world car manufacturer, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "frequency" that Toyota UK told BBC that the UK exit from the EU without agreement would temporarily stop production in a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without an agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
Tovarna Burnaston, which produces Toyotin model Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in case the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, production in our factory would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin Managing Director of Burnaston.
Concerns about how the EU exit would affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW company, for example, acted to close its factory Mini in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main ideas are what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of Brexit.
Toyotin's production line runs according to the "at the right time" principle, with suppliers from the United Kingdom and EU car parts coming every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom were to go out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders which the representatives of the pangos claim could cause to stand and lack of work.
Toyota could not compare her factory in Derbyshire for more than one day's work, the company's representatives would therefore stop production.
Mr Clark said that theres May's future EU-related plan was "expected to avoid such border checks".
"We must reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will, as I say, enable us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," he said for today's BBC's award.
"The data not only Toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota’s company could not comment on how long production would have been stopped, but it had long warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unity Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experiences, the lost job will never come back."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein could be stopped again, the real White House
An important meeting of Donald Trumpa with the deputy general prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, could be "represented for another week" by the White House because of the ongoing colour of the candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian voluntary involvement, links between the Kurp's co-operation and Russia and the potential president's interference with the judiciary.
The question of whether the trumpeter General's envoy will be fired and Mueller's independence has been threatened has been attacked by Washington's speakers for several months.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of hearing equipment to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the President on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein's report is missing.
And last Monday he visited the White House, in the middle of a report on his intention to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
The trumpeter said that Rosenstein would not 'more than leave' and then stop the meeting to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate panel in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Fordov.
On Friday, Trump appointed a united investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the vote of the Senate.
The trumpet's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News release on Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not yet set. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that is happening in the Supreme Court, and we could postpone it for another week.
We'll see. I'm always happy to make sure you're informed."
Some reporters would agree, Sanders hasn't called the White House meeting with the press since 10 September.
The director of Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders has done that the frequency of meetings is not attributed to the "setting up" of TV reporters, but she has said: "You can't miss it if you put it."
Then she mentioned that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding, without reference: "We have looked at the numbers."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can address their question directly to the President of the United States, it is always better than talking to me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when it leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with the host countries.
Automatic press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why he appeared foolishly and partially strangely to the assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister for Health of EU workers in NHS Scotland concerning the fear associated with Brexit
The Health Minister of the EU, working on the Scottish NHS, wrote to express his appreciation for the state and wished to continue the work after breakfast.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom appeared in the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for the cost of establishing the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the issue continued, as we approached the decision-making process.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up preparations for the possible scenario of an out-of-agreement.
I know it has to be a big concern for you all the time.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I value the contribution of each member of staff regardless of his nationality.
Members of all the European Union and non-Member States shall bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit from the patients and the communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland. We really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie suddenly operated after head injury
Liner of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, after his head was injured in a Saturday defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ from The Tennessee magazine.
The main trainer of the Tennessee State University told the journalist that the damage had occurred just a little before midnight.
"He came to the edge of the game and somehow slipped there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen at the back of the playground before placing it on the containers and taking it from the playground for further examination.
An official from the Tennessee State University, Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, said that Abercrombie is recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the details of the type/scale of injury are not yet known’ and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a bridge at the University, plays for the Tennesian State University first after the University of Illinois.
He experienced five hits on Saturday together before he left the game, which his total number of hits in the season increased to 18 hits.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used for the purpose of new business plans for homeless people
The move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
Increased amount will be calculated by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The fundraiser expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds per year.
Foreign buyers will calculate higher rates of interest on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and the money collected will be assigned to the homeless, a message from Theres May will be delivered today.
The effort needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbina's success in attracting young voters with promises to ensure a more affordable location and more taxable persons with high income.
The amount of money will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will encourage government efforts to eradicate unemployment.
In addition to the current calculation, including the higher levels indicated two years ago for other households and non-promoting for delivery, no less than three percentages could be found.
The Fund is expected to collect up to 120 million GBP per year by implementing the measure.
According to the estimates, non-permanent United Kingdom would have to buy 13 percent of newly built London tyres, resulting in two prices and more difficult purchases for the first non-removable.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the main area – have become ‘the place of the spirits’, as the number of buyers living most of their time abroad is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number so that young people could buy their first home.
A large construction company accused the increase in prices with the taking of a country that they do not actually use, Mr. Mayev invited to leave quotas for affordable housing to repair the British "stationary shame."
Mr Corbyn presented the attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the completion of forced displacements without error.
In addition, he wants to give the local world greater powers to build new homes.
Mr. Mayeva said: “Last year I have been working to dedicate my primary leadership to rehabilitating British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
It also means improving our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign businesses as it is for British garage citizens.
For too many people, dream about their own home is too far away, and the decline of unemployment remains too real.’
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is never to become director of Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Schkot enjoys the challenge of rehabilitating the North-East club, which currently sits in the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first one.
He moved on to St. Mirren after he returned to the Scottish Presidency in the last season.
"For my country I wanted to play as a player.
I got B capco and that's it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in driving the club.’
Ross's predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former mayor of Alloa Athletic, who previously rejected the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor of such great names, he did not feel afraid.
"The success is measured for me by the question 'Can I take this club again to the First League?'."
In view of the structure and capacity of this club, there is no doubt in the First League," he said.
"The way to it is not easy, but it would probably be a success trap if you could take the club back there."
Ross does the manager's work for only three years after he was a assistant director in Dumarton and 15 months part of the training staff of Heartsov.
Alloi then helped to prevent the Third League from leaving, and St. Mirren took the lead in the next season from his job.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real milestone," Alloe recalled.
"I was really convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny to hear it because it was going well as a player, so I had a good experience with this, and I also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
Every week you have to face a lot of things.
With this in the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still agree, but management just feels like the right thing again.
I always wanted to run a club and now I do it. In my whole adult life, I feel more comfortable now."

The summer’s temperature increased the incomes of the British boomers, but it also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, groups of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent but restaurant income decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who prepared the data, said: "The persistent suntime and participation of England in a world-long race that lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month when the flow of pumps increased by 2.8 percent only if the restaurants were even stronger.
The drop in traffic in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June has increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased more in comparison than in restaurants.
As a result of the sun's time, there has also been a reduction in sales in pubs that offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurants managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In different pipes and bars, the sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sales of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman from the Free Time and Hospitality Analyst group said: "These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
In the sale on the hospitality market, the biggest factor remains the time and impact of major social or sports events.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although the decline of 4.8 per cent at mid-year level will be particularly painful because of constant cost pressures.
For locals with a long summer meal, it would not be possible to arrive at a better time and will only tell them if it would be necessary to restore the temperatures that we have experienced in August.’
The joint sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, as indicated by the slow introduction of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the average sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the success of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is an industrial reference.
One of the five children on the social network has a secret account that hides it from their parents
The research showed that there is one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, on the social network, a secret account that hides it from parents and teachers
An survey of 20,000 diaries showed the growth of false Instagram pages
The news strengthened the fears of publishing sexually related content
Twenty percent of the diaries have been made to have a "main" account assigned to the parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — is on social networks, the account that hides it from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 dikes showed rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The newspaper strengthened fears of publishing sexually related content.
Twenty percent of the diaries have been used to manage the censored "principal" account they tell parents, and they also have private accounts.
Mother, who finally found her 13-year-old daughter on the cover of the cover, noticed that the visitor's daughter was calling for her to be raped.
A study conducted by the Digital Awarness UK and the Conference of Independent Schools Managers and Managers (HMC) showed that there are 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds of two profiles and half of them recognise that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are subject to temptation and are creating a web space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidhe Doyle will "a voice of athletes" on the Scottish Committee for Athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Committee on Athletics as an executive director of the annual general meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most famous Scottish athletes in the field and on the plain and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who are leading sports to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athlete communities. We are convinced that athletics in Scotland with its involvement in the committee will greatly benefit," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help with driving sports in Scotland."
The American who won from a total of four Olympic medals in the course of 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, has been unable to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I was hit by a seizure.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said he'd just tell me how much time I can recover and how much.
The work was hard, but I recovered all over, I learned to walk again, and today I am running yours for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
A voice for a toothbrush that compares mother to cows has shared online opinions
The company which produces toothbrushes has divided opinions into a declaration that compares the mother to the cows at the time of prayer.
At the start of the marketing ‘first silent transmissible dust pump’, Elvie’s consumer technique company published a causal music video announcement which would demonstrate all the freedom afforded by the aid.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cow in a basket filled with the old one, in a song that includes the following verse: "Yes, I gather, but I see no bread," and "If you haven't seen it, it's not my cuts, it's my stillness."
The church continues: "Drink, suck, feed babies, shake, shake, push."
However, a statement published on the Facebook website has caused a significant decrease on the internet.
Of the 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he saw mixed reactions of viewers, many of whom said that they were looking at the "dangerous" dairy industry.
‘The use of the requirement to announce this product is a very poor decision.
Like me, they also suck and suck to produce milk, but their children are already stealing them in the first days after slaughter," she wrote one.
Elvie/Mother
Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young people.
But why don't you use them for the announcement of breast-feeding mothers who have their children?’
Someone else added, "The voice is completely unfeeling."
The others praised the announcement that one of the women admitted that she seemed to be a song "for the church to be funny".
"I think it's a wonderful idea.
I'd buy it if I were still pregnant.
I felt like a cow when I was picking up.
The speech was a few norms, but I understood it as it was thought.
This is a generic product," she wrote another.
Someone commented: "It's a ridiculous announcement that aims at mothers who are milking (often at work or at a place of work) and feel like cows."
This is not a declaration to praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing with hidden scarfs in the womb.
The concept of actions is that many women who are breast - feeding say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to the breast for breeding, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even work on a simple milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD on the subject, continued to comment. "The Elvie Crepal is such a revolutionary product that you deserve a dignified and provocative presentation."
With this comparison between women who are breast-feeding, and cows who are breast-feeding, we wanted to focus on milk harvesting and all its challenges, but in a fun way that women can associate with, to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new crop will bring.
That's not the first case when Elvie's pickup came to the address.
During the London week fashion, the mother of two children walked on the Manechen trail to make Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants who have been quietly transferred to a warehouse at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, even if the number of monthly crossings remained unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made children more vulnerable to sponsorship.
The majority of sponsors of undocumented migrants are traditionally afraid that they would threaten their own ability to stay in the country with a request for a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities notified that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to issue fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, told the congress that the agency had arrested more than ten people who had been asked to sponsor young people without preparation.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons did not have prior criminal evidence.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or sponsors of sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of them are punished by foreigners.
That is why we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules which would require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention and not 60 days after the previous standard, the workers were given a notice.
Many will appear with a videoconferencing call and not personally in order to appear before the immigration judges.
Those who believe that they are not entitled to help will be excavated soon.
As long as the children are in custody, it is more likely that they will become pregnant or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts following the statements of workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Speakers have said that these concerns are greater in large institutions, such as Tornulu, where signs of child pressure are more likely to remain unobstructed because of their size.
They added that children can move into the place of stores, not to be emotionally prepared or given a chance to speak to their friends, the grass that many of them encounter.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to move immediately
In a petition from the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although in the country for eight years the war has already taken place.
The Mojale, who is also carrying out the duties of the prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegal on the Syrian soil, under the threat of war against terrorism, and that they would "act accordingly with them as well".
"They must be removed suddenly and unconditionally," he said to the congregation.
Moulem said that "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, " almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "warn this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory and in the war-distributed countries.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that its conditions were suitable for returning and owed "some Western countries" to "the spread of unreasonably fears" which the refugees were persuaded to stay abroad.
"The international community and humanitarian organisations have been invited to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"The political issue changes what should be the only humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have challenged Syria not to receive renewable funds until Asaad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important opposition site, Idlibu, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a large number of attacks by the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that he had a "clear year" agreement and expressed hope that military mediation would focus on the Jihadists, including those from Fronte Nusra, associated with Al-Qaida, who "will be eradicated".
Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon call for the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a military constitution for Syria and press the path to war.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for its involvement in the Committee, stating that the work of the Committee should be limited to "the review of the members of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump's gonna get another warrant?
Following this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the re-elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to believe, his presidency has been temporarily terminated with intervention and scandal.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the audience's endurance for now.
Since 2014, CNN's visibility has doubled to 1.05 million during the largest period of observation and MSNBC's visibility has nearly doubled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, more than four years ago in Nielsen, when it was 1.7 million, and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on the MSNBC channel has reached the highest number of cable players with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the "Designed Survivor" (Designed Survivor), about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known post by comedians and authors of the book «Only funny parts: and some hard facts about flying in the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember to ride a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," he told me.
There's a fun value in the cheese.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the story of Washington can decide on the future of Roe's case against Wade as to whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.
The exception is a luxury which only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the six-hour review of the experts' borders discussing the use of "from a deep background" for Boba Woodward's book, US$ 15,000 worth of new words ("adhesive clothing" based on the impact," said The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, chem, anatomia.
Sam, for example, I'm never gonna look at Super Maria again.
‘The part of his start that causes a dream of real giving is that he offers something every night,’ said Brent Montgomery, director-in-chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of ‘Pown Stars’ about the business of Trump's show and the day-to-day closing scenarios (two with N.F.L., thanks to Kim Jong Una).

When I talked to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his house on the north coast of Kauai at 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was impressed inside by the sight of MSNBC when he was filmed by CNN.
Nothing could have been removed, nor could anyone have faced Brett Kavanaugh with the Senate Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was high in the air.
"I remember that we created all these crazy gifts at the time and people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is being drawn up in preparation for the most intimate inter-mission elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania area, money flow is observed, as two candidates were found in the same seating truck due to the reorganization of the congresses.
This was the home of Democratic representative Conoria Lamba, who won his seat on the special elections this year in the new Pittsburgh area.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The cards were re-enacted when the retired Supreme Court ruled in January that the old environment was adversely affected for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the course of the new 17th century, the fight for the financing of the campaign between the main financial bodies of the parties, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broad-tracked special elections of the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won in the area for 20 points.
Political commentators give democracy a simple advantage.
In the U.S., they were thinking about sanctions against Salvador because of China's support, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, even though there is little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panam Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners took over the leadership of Trump's organisation.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw US diplomatic missions leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from "new decisions on the withdrawal of Taiwan" in a statement beginning in the month of Heather Nauert, the representative of the Ministry.
However, the sanctions were taken into account with regard to Salvador, which, by 2017's estimates, would receive US$ 140 million, including aid for combating drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would have been a serious threat to the Central American state with a high level of unemployment and the number of deaths.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development that would continue to hold a similar meeting during the chain year, which was further assessed as a step towards preventing migration into the United States.
By mid-September, however, the highest government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding their consideration of the sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now charged with speaking to the participants of the conference, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the US government assigns to the meeting.
Three US emissaries returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed on their appointment under the terms of anonymity.
Their speech was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and also spoke about it under the terms of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible interference of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller should also point out whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in an attack on the American War.
If the convention is to change its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before his colleagues are gathered, at the moment when he is ready to speak again to his voters.
In this regard, there is a lot of questions and I do not want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable and not his followers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a war could be.
In 1938 the German officials were prepared to launch an attack on Hitler if the West attacked him and supported him in Munich in Czechoslovakia.
We didn't succeed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the flight of the clan that followed.
Such transitions change the course of history and speed up or stop the relentless process of democracy.
The Americans with several such transitions agree right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump is going to release General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in prison since the journalist reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his incompetence to this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation by the FBI Britta Kavanaugh will not be exhausted or fair or if it will be appointed as a Supreme Judge in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and misconduct?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-convention elections which will require Mr. Trumpa's responsibility?
If we're going to experience these trials, we're waiting for long winter democracy.
But I'm sure it won't bother us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who deported her to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once sat in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to observe the Sabbath festival on the table with the swastikas.
How can it not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimist before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that they will be defeated by Austria after the impressive regime against Villarrreal in Spain at the beginning of this month in a convincing position for the qualification of the Group of G of the European League.
The damage of the knee to the tied player Graham Dorrance prevented him from appearing first in the season before the end of 2:2 against Villarreal, but I believe that Rangers can use it as a resort for larger achievements.
"This was a deserved point for us because Villarreal was a strong team," said 31-year-old.
"We entered into the game confident that we can achieve something and take the point.
We might finally win, but there's probably a fair result on the overall team.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game we have achieved good results, but I am confident with a lot for us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year was undoubtedly difficult, depending on everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this end now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season for ourselves and achieve success."
Poor spy woman due to fear of savings
Despite having a clear view of how to care for them, the investigators talk to their family members about it only a few people.
Half of the investigators of the nationwide insurance research have been able to discuss the costs of long-term insurance with the law.
Only 10 percent of them were able to talk about it with children.
"People want them to care for a family member, but they don't try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector at the Nationalwide insurance sector.
You can start in the next way.
Talk to the couple and the children: You can’t prepare to take care of yourself if you don’t talk to her about it right away.
Talk to the consultant and the family about where and how you want to receive care, as this may be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include a financial adviser: Your financial adviser can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative so that you can determine the trust of a valuable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authorisation of persons for their finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aging parent needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?

In Ilfracombu, a man was shot several times with an air gun
A man who came home last night was shot with an air gun several times.
He was shot at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombu, Devon, when he was shot several times in his chest, arm and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 2.30 p.m. after the British time, as "the next action".
She didn't see her attacker's victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, but the police have called for possible witnesses to announce.
Possibilities and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of victims would increase.
In closed communication connections, rescuers from the Doghre Regent were unable to obtain any information from the area north of Palu, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 expansion epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu.
Some key information on Paluja and Doghrai in Slavonia:
Palu is the capital of Central Slavonia, the province that lies at the end of the Great Lake on the west coast of the island of Slavazi and is expected to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was attacked by riots and riots.
Dodhra is a landscape that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west of the island of Slavazi.
Regency, the administrative unit under the territory, had a population of 299,000 according to estimates in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Slovak Republic are fishing and farming, in particular in the central region of Doghrea.
In the province there is also an important activity of nil mining, which is mostly carried out in Morovalija, on the opposite side of Slovakia.
Palu and Dongheo have repeatedly been hit by the tsunamis in the last 100 years after reporting by the Indonesian Agency for the relief of natural disasters.
In 1938 he caused more than 200 people to die and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghrei.
In 1996 he also hit the mines north of Doghreo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an active Tihocean fireplace, so it appears regularly.
In recent years there have been some major earthquakes and tsunamis as follows:
2004: A higher rise in the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and caused 226,000 people to die along the Indian border, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005: A kind of strong earthquake struck Western Sumatra late in March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and devastated the tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: Potres magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Potres magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mantawai islands and blew up the canals of up to 10 meters that destroyed your ducat and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Regent in Acehu and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time he didn't break up with the cannons, but down the buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: More earthquakes have affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and have caused more than 500 people to die, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
The arrest of the oldest son of Sarah Palin for violence in the family
Track Palina, the oldest son of former Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-olds from Vasilla, Alaska were arrested on account of the amount of violence in the family, the ban on the application of violence in the family and the arrest of arrest, the police agency of Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin knew that when she tried to call the police to report a suspicious criminal action, she took the phone for the year.
The fires were caught in the Mat-Su Precazen Foundation and held under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was said to be "probably innocent" when he was asked about the statement, she reported the network.
The fires were accused of three Class A crossings, which meant that they could shut him down for one year and punish him with a depth of $250,000.
He was also charged with one cross-class B, which is punished with one day in prison and depth of USD 2000.
The fire of criminal action is not charged first.
In December 2017 he was charged with attacks on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspicious attack.
For example, it's right now in front of the Aljasian Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in the reporting of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the Veteran groups in 2016 when her son’s violent conduct associated with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Contest with tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Slavazi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 quake broke out and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been interrupted, and the number of victims of death should increase in the days to come.
The earthquake occurred only in central Slavonia, which lies northeastern from the Indonesian capital of Jakarte.
In social media, videotapes that show the moment of growth are crossed.
When he hit the quays at the lake, more than a hundred people were held in the city of Palu at the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors rarely require a death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death penalty for Sayfulla Saip, a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died. This is a rare penalty that has not been committed for federal crimes in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, to use the new delivery truck to carry out a collision along the West Side road in South Manhattan when he drove more passengers and passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip 'saip' has killed eight victims and 'marginal' has caused serious physical injury, which is recorded in the notification of the death penalty requirement in South New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty may be any of the charges.
More than a week after the attack, the Saip's large related jury identified with a complaint at 22 points which included eight complaints of murder by means of rape, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for 'facial planning and appeal' by the prosecutors who described Saip's way as 'a barbaric, cruel and outlawed'.
‘Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to his family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drak, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuccia,’ was written in a notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the South District has issued the last death sentence ten years ago.
The defendant Khalida Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in July 1953 by Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who died of the theft of the Soviet Union between the cold war two years ago.
Both Rosenberg died on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not file complaints in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, the investigator said he felt good about what he did.
According to the complainant, Saip's authority said he was inspired by ISIS videotapes that you watched on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also acted to require the release of the ISIS facility into their hospital room.
In view of the 22nd point of the complaint, it was said that it was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saip, said that they were "exactly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
‘We believe that the decision on the death penalty requirement will instead accept the confession of a crime in place of life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only increase the tolerance of these events,’ said Patton.
The Saip's defence team has asked the prosecutors not to require the death penalty.
For Brexit negotiations, NIgela FARGEA should be charged with the real Torian Ambassador
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the human army" during a protest at the Toric conference today.
Ukipa's leader once said that the policies must "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics when one of the own envoys Theres May suggested that it should be owed for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he was Secretary of Brexit Farage.
However, the challenge faced by Mayeva in coordinating its deeply divided species was still stressed by the thoracic, forced refusal of Brexit, which joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its plan in the race between attacks on Brexit, anti-Brexite and EU spokesmen.
The contractors insisted that Mayeva in Brussels would try to reach agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between their package and "kauss".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Option means departure) in Solihulu that "he wants to get rid of Chechers".
He said we should appoint Mr Faragea as a co-rapporteur and assign him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been charged, he would have been out by now," he said.
The messenger from Wellingborough added: "I'll support the brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chechers."
His opposition to the EU was described in the following words: "We have not fought in the world wars to be servants now.
In our own country we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion since the 2016 vote had changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The agreement was also reached by Turkish Brexit Andrew Jenkins, who said to the rapporteur: "I simply say: 'Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan for the general public is not acceptable, its opposition will not vote, and it is also unacceptable for our customers and our activists, who are active in the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave Chechers and start listening.’
In a message directed by Ge Mayev, he added: "The Prime Minister will keep their service when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage agreed that it should be given to politicians to "feel warm" if they intend to issue decisions adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about confidence between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get out of Brexite, and we're going to say to them today, 'We won't let you do this.'
In the message inspired by many, he added: "I want you to let our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit's release, feel the heat."
"We mobilize the human army of these countries that have provided us with victory at the brexita, and we will not rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the miners flew through Birmingham, where they then had a double seat in the city center.
The activist's flag was small after the group was set up this weekend with the Tory's anti-frextic flags.
The labist nobleman Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatory because of security problems in applying the client’s application after the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for the border without delay, for a simple trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like good breakfast," he added.
Warren's position will probably be "examined closely"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "co-operation in the presidency will be closely studied" after November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trumpa, will compete against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-President of the Trumpo's voluntary campaign in Massachusetts in 2016 for re-election.
It's in the middle of speculation to meet with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of the Town Hall since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to compete for the president's place.
Warren replied that it is time for "the garden of women in Washington and to fix our corrupt government, which requires women on top."
Shooting arrest after the death of LSU Simsa player
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on Friday for shooting LSU's wayd Sims basketball player.
The police station in Baton Rougu was a news item on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at the press conference at 11 a.m. after the east time.
They published a video of Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying people on the website.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed on Friday near the South University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered shots in his head and died because of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, reported 247sports.
Wade got involved in protecting his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted on hearing that he was at the end of the event, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayda Sims.
Simpsons were arrested without arrest and taken to police station East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rougu, has played 32 games in the last season with 10 beginners, on average with 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps.
Russia’s great prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the world’s first title, and the team ordered him to leave Sebastian Vettlu
It became on Saturday at the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that "the size of Mercedes will have a strong impact on the hierarchy".
Bottas started well at the start and almost let Hamilton go in the dry when he defended his position in the first two camps and invited Vettla to attack his master's colleague.
The leader took the first one into the box and let Hamilton drive on a road map, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took it into the box later and left it for Vettlam, but after several driving operations, Hamilton noted that Ferrari's integrity leaves the inside side open and the risk of leaving behind two defence moves in the third wheel.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday at seven.
After that, most of the race was driven without changing tires, as he was planning to run a quick finish, hit Kimia Raikkonen and hit a fourth place.
He finally took it to 44th circle, but in the rest of the eight circles he could not increase speed, so the fourth place was Raikkonen.
It's a hard day because Valtteri was a fantastic driver all weekend and he was a real waitress when he let me out.
The team has done a really great job to achieve first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a really weak body language.
President Donald Trump spoke in agreement on Saturday with Senator Diane Feinstein because of her persistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
According to West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's talks before the Senate's investigation committee, but rather said that what is happening in the Senate said people are "bad, corrupt and false".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen and happen in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are mean, corrupt and lying," he said.
"When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, 'No, I didn't do this'."
I did not do that.’
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you discovered the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Okay, wait a minute.
We discovered it... no, we didn't," he added about the impression of the senator.
Fordova sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was disclosed in early September – but Feinstein's suspect that it came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's case, I didn't disclose her letter," said the Commissioner after the report of the newspaper The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for safety and I kept him safe as she asked."
However, her disappearance apparently did not fit the president who agreed on Saturday night: "I tell you, this was a really bad speech of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
In the defence of a candidate for a Supreme Court accused by three women of improper sexual conduct, the president insisted that democratics abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You've seen evil, cruelty, they don't care who they're trying and who they have to drive to fight for power and control," said the President after the Mediaite website's report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two naked men for the Great Against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for the fifth losing in the elite league against Belfast Giants with a victory in the Saturday Games in Dundee with 5:3.
The Giants were taken to two caves in the back of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were executed for their home side, and then Dwyer again got advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard destroyed for Dundee before two blind Lundvald Nielsensna gave them a victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elythic League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee at 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the gentlemen, during which Gianntis won in the previous three games.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game at 3:35 at Kendall McFaulla's assistant, Beauviller, who spent four minutes later, and gave him David Rutherford.
In an intensive introduction work, Sullivan once again mentioned at 13:10 in the game at home, and Matt Marquartt gave Covni for execution at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of Ginantov's leadership on vacation when at the end of the first third he took his second round of dinner.
The home side is back together, and Bouchard's stay is over with a violent hole at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have been helped together by Nielsen to give the Dundee priority at the end of the second quarter and to provide for a win with five rounds of their share and five rounds of their share at the end of the third.
The giants who have lost four of their last five games will play the next game at Milton Keynes's home on Friday.
The air traffic controller, by his death, allowed more than a hundred people on the plane to flee before the explosion
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as hero after sacrificing their lives to make sure that they can fly with more than a hundred people safely.
In the fifth earthquake on the island of Slavazi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died, and a number were missing.
The areas continue to suffer from severe depression, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the participants escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his place of work in a powerfully scrambling control chair at Muteara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed in it that he could fly Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the airway, safely flew.
Then he jumped out of the control chair because he thought he'd hit it.
He died in the hospital later.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in another place.
We're sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart becomes a market when we hear it," he added.
In the meantime, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, as the Disaster Relief Agency in the State has done limited access to the city in Doghrei, Sigiya and Boutangang.
"The number of dead should increase, as there were numerous bodies under the debris, and many of us could not reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, representative of the agency.
The palace, where many funerals will take place on Sunday, has been abandoned by waves, up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle takes the body.
He's missing clean water.
The minimum markets are broken down everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross needs to help me survive, but we don't know what they'll find.
It is now a tragedy that can become even worse.’
On Sunday, the Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu and told the national army: "I ask you all to work night and day to carry out all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?’ According to the CNN report.
In Indonesia, early this year, more than 550 people died in Lombok.
Micronose Air Niugini Air Company now says that after air traffic in the cabin one person is missing
The airline that operated the flight that ran in the Pacific coast of Micronesia now says that they miss one person after they first reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the passenger plane.
Air Niugini reported on Saturday afternoon that there was no male passenger.
Air carriers have been told that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in search of the missing person.
The call for more information on a passenger, such as his age or nationality, was not immediately answered.
Local ships helped to save other passengers and crews after the flight was underway when they tried to dock at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officials said they had taken seven persons to the hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday there were eight passengers in the hospital who were all stable.
The reason for the noise and precise order of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the airfield just before the flight.
Some of the stories said that the plane was wrong.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to cross through the passage of a stream of water to the violent exits on the passenger plane.
He said the Stevards were panicked and drunk, and I suffered less headaches.
The U.S. Navy has also been able to help seafarers who were nearby to repair their sails. They have been helped with the use of an overcrowded boat with which people moved to the ground before flying to about 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades of the plane accidents in Papua New Guinea, 111 people have died, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
Analyticals determined the time of the night when women were alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a resounding case to the man who was charged with the death of a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice analysis Paul Rowlett spoke for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used phone calls to determine the move of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous claims, reported the journalist The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that he was his mobile phone at Chambers at the time he said he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's camp that night, he said he was "false because he was my truck in Nashville."
The second failure was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks ago.
The phone records say they've only met in a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis at the time after Chambers' death from his phone deleted Chambersina's texts, calls and contact information.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence should present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the trial should be judged by the jury later that day.
The High Broad: What's a conscious hippie?
Hiphop trio wants to cause a negative image of the genre by completing its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that the hipop has been away from its original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to their roots and make a congenital hippie popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently experienced a resurgence with artists like Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black one?!
New York security charges for letting her go because of the "racist" message
The New York couple complained that they had discriminated against her after receiving the wrong message from the mother who accused her of being "one more black."
A few cases of racist behaviour and complaints are compared to "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the new Waruška, Giselle Maurice, found out that this was the plant.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEE another CHNKA,’ she wrote in her letter to her husband, Plasco-Flaxmanov.
But instead of sending him to a man, she sent him twice as far as G. Maurice.
After finding out that she had grown up, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unfriendly", Mr. Maurice, fired, saying that her outgoing lawyer who was an African American, had done a bad job and wanted to hire the Philippines, reported the New York Post.
Mr. Maurice received a pay for one day's work and then they sent her home with Uber.
Maurice now claims compensation from money to court at a rate of USD 350 per day for the six-month period of work for which it was first hired, although without contracts.
"I want to show them, you know, these things don't start," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism with the claim that the release of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that, unfortunately, she could no longer be trusted.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist," says Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone to whom you were rude, even if it happened by means of a bribe?
Your newborn?
No, no.’
In comparison with the ‘dwelling’ complaint, Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going to get over someone like this?
This is not good," added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings are still before the court, the court of public opinion has condemned a couple on social networks because of its conduct and way of thinking.
The Founders of the Paddington Bear History were afraid that the bears would not be connected to the oral bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said: “It’s hard to put into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to know this now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She did so that her father, who at first acted as a BBC cameraman, before he had the hope of writing a book on a little bear game, would have been angry when he refused his job, added that after his death it was the 60th anniversary of the book "Greek-Speed".
In view of Mrs. Paddington, who described him as a "very important member of our family", she said that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was these people who didn't like to praise him," she said.
"But since the bear Paddington was so real to her, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You're proud of her, although you're not really doing it yourself.
I think Miss Paddington's success was seen in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his opinion, he has always attributed success to Bear Paddington himself.’
My daughter died, and I had to call her on the phone.
On arrival, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Louis Pasteuria 2 in Nice, where doctors sometimes tried to save her life.
"She called over regularly to tell her that she felt so bad that she didn't expect it to happen," she said.
"Then I got Nadov's call. He told me she'd die in the next two minutes, and I had to get rid of her.
And I'm here.
I did, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by her doctors to keep her heart burning were gradually taken and left her system.
She's been dead for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit down and wait, you know, it's all gone.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to stay."
Ednan Laperouse, who has already regretted the loss of her daughter, landed on the plane with other passengers, not aware of the experience she has had.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head removed, and all the time I had sunglasses on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Grieving female leppies crying to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one in suicide try to refuse to take life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wally Bridge, you're crying with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Son Ge. Tyler was 13 when he fell into depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"For no parent I don't want you to feel like I am every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, 45 years old living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a funny smile.
"Everyone knew him after his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
But before he died he stopped working because he was "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life.
Mr. Davis said, "I am concerned that the dominant effect will be triggered."
Mr Davis made a complaint, "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.’
Mr. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not establish an eye contact with them or something similar."
She said that her death was a terrible blow to her, but they had to treat her: “She had a hole in the whole family.
She blew us up.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh is at the beginning of the FBI's investigation into the air
"I believe that if we can actually carry out what he asked for – after the length and scope of the limited investigation, this may have been a point for us," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be "lossed" because of the persistent party situation.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
Until the interlocutory elections that will take place on 6 November, only five weeks – if the Republicans, as it is expected, have lifted their weaknesses, this will make them very weak when trying to elect a willing person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to vote in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was represented by his current wife Ashley, now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI is preparing a report?
In the Senate currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could raise at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have led to the defeat of the position and election to the Supreme Court by Mike Pence, Vice-President.
The number of North Korean refugees declined under Kimmo
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un arrived seven years ago, a South Korean ambassador said.
The Bayeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1127 people had escaped since January 2011, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said they were the key factor of strict border control between North Korea and China and increased prices required by silent people.
Pjongjang hasn't commented on this yet.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two of Korea.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriate them.
The relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang at talks focusing on the conclusion of the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Unn in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort to pursue the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong has been sentenced to American sanctions since then.
"With no confidence from the United States, confidence in our national security will not be a thing of the past, and in such circumstances we will not be unilaterally divided," said Mr. Ri in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi marked Bretta Kavanaugh as "historic" and said that he was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives was a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh for "historic" and acted as a significant inappropriate for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosija did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of anyone other than a woman, if she did so, as a "historic"," commented the Senate's fourth speech before the Commission of Inquiry.
Kavanaugh was busily accused of assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were a teenager.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, often nearly intruding into the discussion about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned democracy in the Commission, and the charges against himself were marked by "grotess and co-ordinated harassment" organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie said to me that Kavanaugh's speech proved that he should not be appointed as a Supreme Judge because it showed that he was opposed to the Democrats.
"I believe that with such statements and a way of fighting against Clinton and Democrats, he has discriminated against," she said.
Pelosie asked whether she would try to file a constitutional complaint against Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and Democrats would get most in the House of Representatives for the moment.
“I will say so – if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the Court in which it is now," Pelosie said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosie has done so as a democratic concern that Kavanaugh's decision against the Law on Access to Health Care or the Roe case against Wad is applicable to a conservative judge.
In its confirmed hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, hostile person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is it not wonderful?'," said Pelosie.
And women must hate him.
It's a fair result, after months and years of verbal abuse, and it can't be expressed without a cry.
"We cry when we're angry," she did 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you think?"
She continued: “It was very helpful for me to have a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was upset, but she developed a technique, which was when she broke up and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘ Maybe you feel sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then she just kept going.
It seemed to me superior.’
The salts are as an exit for anger as they are partially allowed because they are misunderstood by people.
One of my most powerful memories of my early career when I was still working at the office where men ruled, when I once found myself crying in an inexorable rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by my neck - a cold guide I always had a few fears that attracted me to the stage.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand you're mad.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was jumped across the board in a chair named Monkey Business and had to stand out from the game, Mr. Schroeder concluded that there was no reason why the president could not apply for himself.
"This was not a good decision," she laughed 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates were already involved in the competition and one was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone then referred to the game as 'Sneglectus and seven thumbs'.
As the campaign was last joined, it remained in the fund collection, so it decided not to take part in the competition unless US$ 2 million was collected.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to a man, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a break?" she asked herself.
When she spoke that she would not start the official campaign, her feelings — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and focus on the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger over sexism — were so overwhelming that she began to breathe.
"We would think I had a nerve disorder," he said.
"We would think my official sponsor Kleenex is.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my wallet.
‘Did she play?’
How could the war between the United States and China be used by Beijing?
The beginnings of trade wars between the United States and China were exciting, and although the battle has not been completed in the past, experts say that it could be used for a long time by Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US President, first warned at the beginning of the year with the taxation of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week with new goods tariffs worth USD 200 billion (GDP (GDP (GB50 billion)), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has always been taxed with equivalent repayment measures, last with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving around from the United States to an eye and is likely not yet cross-border.
If Washington could leave, China would have to agree to its demands, but it would be a public withdrawal from the US for Chinese President Shi Jinping too embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Peking would know how to withdraw the right movement, US pressure in the trade war would have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that rapid political decision-making in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic over-exploitation in any country is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, an expert associate focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, real foreign minister
Syria says it is prepared for voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country which has been left behind in more than seven years of war.
In the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Mouale said that the situation in the country improved.
"Today conditions on the ground are more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to dream of areas destroyed by terrorists in order to rebuild normal conditions.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the abandoned state.
He also argued that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsored by the opposition.
Europe won the victory in Ryder's race in Paris
The European team against the US team with final score 16.5 versus 10.5 at the Le Golf National at Paris in France won Ryder's 2018 race.
The UN has now lost six times in European soil and Ryder's canal has not won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Björna team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the primes, was trapped in the water on 16th of August in the par-3 game at his first punch, which required the game to pass on to Francesca Molinari.
The Italian golfers Molinari have gone through all their rounds and has become one of the four players who have ever achieved 5-0-0 results since the beginning of the first year of 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth won with 5 and 4 the lowest awarded player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played last in Ryder's generation.
The veteran of eight Ryder's race, Spain Sergio Garcia, has become the most powerful European player at the top of all times.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was hard this year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for raising me up and believing in you.
So happy, I'm so happy that we won the party again.
It's a team and I'm really glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The keynote address is John Ramu, who won the American football team Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in individual games.
"I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now he has a career record in Ryder's race 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles immediately after Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all week to find the right path, except Patrick Reed, Justina Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played golf all the time throughout the first grade.
The U.S. captain said after his team's bad behavior, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we got a couple of pressure on Europe.
We've been down.
It's a club down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to meet again, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder's Committee and we're moving on.
I really like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Head down.
We are being attacked.’
