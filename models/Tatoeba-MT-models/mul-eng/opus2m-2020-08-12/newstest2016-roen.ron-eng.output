UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations has again asked all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban announced Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - at the end of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unsolved".
Ban asked the five remaining members to prove the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude a nuclear-weapon-related agreement in Iran, addressing such a crisis in Syria.
8 numbers from polls showing that Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for the impotence.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump out of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump conducts with one percent of two figures and some voices begin to question seriously what this means for the numbering of the property cell.
Of course, it's still too early.
None of these say that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance took Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state during the nomination.
And the reasons why it would have been difficult for general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economics Club for Growth acknowledge Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We then present you with some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mollusc is not just something that goes on:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his application, in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republics had a positive view of the real estate molluscs.
By mid-July, the percentage was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion on Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are kept.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination course.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasts" or "much" if Trump won the nomination course.
Only two out of 10 says it would be "opportunity" if Trump would win the nomination course.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says it would be "enthusiasm" against 40% who declares the same thing about Trump).
The closest thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unmovable" or "opportunity" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination course.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temper to be a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for his and his bombistic insults, 52% of Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate mollusc has the appropriate temperature to be president, according to ABC News/Washington Post monthly survey.
We record the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six of the 10 independents claim that his temper has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take intellectuals' attitude, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination course, four out of 10 said that Trump.
The situation changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would be on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read very well in the future.
During the same period of the last election, four of the 10 republics chose Rick Perry during the nomination course, only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign to be a positive one.
Even if the Republicans or responded to another candidate, the trumpet is still in front of everyone.
Some votes say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be shared by more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted early in September of the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and, finally, 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasach and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would beat the man with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation from one to the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they decided.
A new survey conducted on CBS/NYT marks shows that over half of the voters who support Trump do not change their vote option.
Obviously, much can happen in this sense and no one can say that this will never be solved.
46% say that they let the port open the possibility of changing the option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is now the Ben Carson neurosurgery, but it is twice as likely as the voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign speech, two months later, immigration was the main subject of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a scandal between the important Spanish voters and the Republican Party and will undermine the efforts of the rebraining.
However, according to ABC/Post monthly survey, six out of 10 Republicans claim they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the problem of migration remains in the light of reflections, Doland Trump will also remain.
Frustration against authorities reaches new conclusions.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, mostly due to their status of externals.
According to ABC/Post monthly survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider in the destruction of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the benefits of the Republicans in the Congo, 54% are "unmute" and 21% "revealed".
Jeremy Corbyn takes the lead at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been delayed
The new leader of the Laburist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will take the lead later at Prime Minister's Questions, meeting for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and the labour parliamentarians.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for “lower theater and more facts”.
He also stated that he could give up on several participants and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader, after he named a "fantom cabinet" and after his talk on Tuesday at the TUC annual convention.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party's decision to keep silence at the breaking of national fame during a job held in March with the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew critics from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that it "conserved peace in a respectful way" and recognized "the erosion of British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's phantom cabinet, Owen Smith, said for the Two's Newsnight broadcast by BBC that he would have advised the lab leader to sing the "independent" national immunization of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers from the ghost cabin refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by different opinions related to the economy, defence and external, while at least one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the policy differences "conform" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment refer to his position towards the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring about changes by removing the entire idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the level of "cap" from 26,000 lire to 23,000 lire.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth lab leader facing David Cameron in court in the last decade since he took the lead in the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different policy approach, says he has ideas "in external sources" for questions addressed to Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said PMQs involves a very high level of confrontation and will depend on responses and attacks, committed to focusing on such serious problems as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, would take her place at PMQs when he can't participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on the occasion, saying that he had addressed the President of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs but later recognized that he did not succeed in his career.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the rationale of a leader, the way in which it leads the House of Representatives and its position among parliamentarians, although the criticism has claimed that it has become a character and that it needs a profound reform.
"Frame in Joburg": Young people with no background benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a man without a trace in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a trade and earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit study that teaches young people without having to take photographs of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
The BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says the biggest salary could give rise to
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that an increase in minimum wage in the UK could mean "a greater purchasing power in consumer potential buzons."
However, it is less likely that the respective purchasing power exceeds the biggest costs for the labour force within the company, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be commended and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a co-authorial victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios and his behavior deserves more praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talent duo named "Special Ks", was badly delayed in the light of the reflections by the scandalous retreat that Kyrgyos had faced by Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-time professional game after, in Cincinnati, the court had to intervene twice in order to disband Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground on Kyrgyos, and I should have put him on the ground on this kid."
Although it was last seen making a muscular scratch after it had muscle cramps and ratting a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly shown by Healy.
The adolescent is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for the second place on the individual, after Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal.
"One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little behind the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost because he was accused of cracks in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket of frustration in front of him and I know Thanasi well enough so I know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, she's got extremely good in situations pretty exciting in the US with Harrison and so far and I think she deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family together and he thinks he's been treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, he had no conflict with other players, he was very respected in his dress, he was trained very hard, he is in an excellent shape, he is very balanced and mature and thinks he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrugios in the calculation for the important remix game, which begins Friday, and described the "common decision" as being the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in a long term in the team.
"Firstly, we want the team to concentrate entirely on the remixture game and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgyos]," Healy said.
And I think Nick ran very quickly, as people like Federerer and Murray said, he matured under public conditions and made some terrible and worthy mistakes to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time that is not at the center of attention to reflect, good for both the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has reduced to half the national polls
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, continues to have a two-digit advantage in the democratic process for candidate at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (in front of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will apply for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
In front of the survey conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton maintains the advantage between women and moderation, but the advantage has been reduced.
The support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the Democrats under 50 years of age has been evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
Despite this, Clinton is still in favor of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with one percent of two figures, among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say he would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he were willing to apply for the party's name.
A sphere would support it anyway reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be surprising, the probability of Clinton's current supporters being enthusiastic about their choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a sphere would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic voters claim to support it with enthusiasm Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the course, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time came for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-Presidents take up a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in progress - although a third believes that he should not apply.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would have a second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply in the course of the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the course to 30 points if it does not.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton's candidate with the highest chance of winning general elections; but the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is at the distance of two but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible to grow.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of e Eligibility.
As last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate shall be considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential course.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates shall make good use of some of the key features of their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be complete and trustworthy and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three as regards integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and trusted, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this sense.
Democrats generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as they do.
With regard to all these aspects, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal e-mail address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are grateful for their explanation of the subject and say that they have not been affected by the general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the U.S. public.
Half of Americans are unmistakably now explaining it, while only about a third are grateful.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue arose.
Most Americans claim that their e-mail dispute has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
In particular, more than six out of 10 Republicans say they have changed their opinion on Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrated and trusted, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it integrated and trusted, with 8% less than last month and with 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it an integral and reliable one.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider it an integrated and credible Trump.
However, both Clinton and Trump were white for leadership.
Among the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are the first to be classified in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider him as an integral Sanders is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The error margin for the 351 sample of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity were accused of killing the student in 1 year from the Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a ritual beginning in the Poconi Mountains of Pennsylvania, five persons were charged with murder.
The members of Pi Delta Psi of the Baruch University in New York attacked Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013 and tried to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
The official sources say that the victim was tied to his eyes, placed behind him a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly crushed while trying to turn to a tent, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused her of headaches after losing her consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brothers did not call the emergency number after it disappeared and claimed it would be expected an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for its symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, president of the fraternity at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their personal goods and put the good news of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's well-being," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day in the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated headaches, bruises and cuts.
" Too many families have been destroyed by the brother's rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Their brothers and their members should be accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Major Juriu of the Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with three-stage murder.
The other thirteen and two members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be put under charge of further and more complicated crime.
"We want to draw on the answer not only to the persons involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised fraud, official or informal, we will also draw on the answer," Wagner said on March at a press conference.
The University of Baruch has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity and has withdrawn the association with local representation.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve grows the rate of profits
The profit rate will increase and the Bull market (the increase market) will improve, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is when it's going to happen and how long it'll last.
In the economy, history offers little indications of timing.
After the first increase in the profit rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase the rates of profits is not always a determinant of how economics and financial assets are responded.
As a result, U.S. central bank officials have stressed so much that investors should not focus on the time when they start to increase their profit rate and on the time required for normalisation.
Actually, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could find that all the aggression related to the increase in profit rate has been excessive.
"The first increase in the profit rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will be made inevitable by some voices as a sign of the era "Effectin banks", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to the most normal levels but still little to constitute the seismic shock that appears to be fear of everyone.
But it can't be said that there won't be any effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation in which the market has been faced in recent months, anticipation of the increase in the profit rate can volatile things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It appears that there is a tendency for capital profitability to slow down for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the monetary policy deficit again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has grown rough - about 14 per cent - leading to a rise in the profit rate, quite invariable over the 250-day period (meaning 2.6 per cent) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the lead strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of the profit rate and the benefits begin to decrease.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but the increase in the profit rate will soon contribute to it.
In the face of this situation, Fed is faced with certain conditions that have not existed before and which could speed up a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historic minimum point for an increase in the Fed profit rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 increase in the profit rate since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if the value in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, the situation is less expected to continue, the third quarter is only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in profit rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different", Deutsche said.
The players on the market have been preparing for an annual increase decision by Fed, all the eyes are drawn to this week's meeting of the Federal Commission of the Open Market, which is closed today.
Although a number of strategies and economists are of the opinion that FOMC could approve an increase in the profit rate at the time of this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our post-50 study, all growth cycles of the profit rate have so far been found in a super-growth cycle of profit, the GDP eclampling the crops very quickly before the recession begins to recover," said the report.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed future has also been a volleyball since the market anticipates an increase in the profit rate and the type is otherwise similar to the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, it appears that the benefits change the immediate direction of first growth/down of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle of the profit rate, the profitability of the obligations falls immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these increases in the profit rate will determine the drawback between short-term and long-term obligations, applying the curve.
High-performance obligations are better developed in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about boosting profitability", said Kathy Jones, a regular analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the fall in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more stringent monetary policy," Jones wrote.
The short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is more accurate, the spread of the credit gain average rate has increased and the volatility has increased - all market features when Fed stops policy.
In large lines, companies carrying out the majority of U.S. activities will gain as a result of the increase in the profit rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational debt will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to their consumption in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more profitable within the next three months for an initial increase in the profit rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balances exceeded those with a weak balance after each of the profit rate increases from 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital savings and low-voltage stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percent points), respectively 3 (percent points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most lost, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have a profit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how soon this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, said MP Andrew Bingham
Parliamentary Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post because "profess"
This says it's from what's more like the commercial opponent.
He also took into his eyes BBC Music Awards, claiming they were crying for Brits' prizes.
Col. Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that neither this show was original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms to" Classic FM, said an important MP, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also sent BBC leaders that the public radio post is "prosperous" and is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
"I had the impression that Radio 3 "prostos" - although I don't like to use the word - but I had the impression that it's becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also took into his eyes BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I just copy what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC rejected the charges, stating that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I won't find anything about classical music coming from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production doesn't matter.
"In addition, I think it is also important for Radio 3 to discover new music and to assign new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that more efforts must be made to attract audiences from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC seal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Mass Media and Sport because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC- buy-in talent show from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds of sterline.
Do you understand why there is so much discussion about the emissions in question that it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Palma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a gold egg in his garden" next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future takeover of new seasons from The Voice or spend money on other forms of entertainment licenses.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and the blame could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month the slowest growth has been recorded from 2000 until now.
Online sales have progressed over three years, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that the November Black Friday could determine the discount on expenses.
Over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned commercial streets from the British Sea into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August has shown the smallest growth from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and return until 2000, there has always been a rationalizing trend in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales have progressed three years ago, when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's slowing down, you could notice a decline (growth).
The name Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases prior to the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers were placed in front of computers to put their hand on the offer, which led to the crossing of more retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers fought chilipiers, could determine the reticence of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ of each 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion shops in commercial areas.
Following the Sanction of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the Macaral invasion of Mecca
The 29 bodies of those who lost their lives were on the streets of Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has won part of the giant in the Saudi Binladin Group construction.
The Ministry of Health stated that 394 people were injured after the macara seizure
At the street crossing ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaroleum thrown into the Mecca mosque.
Dressed in white, those who complained of their deaths joined the road to express their condolences until the first death arrived at the end of the final trip, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad reminder preserved by the holy place, where only a few days later a building macaroni was dug through the mosque ceiling, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the Saudi kings penalized the Bin Laden family building group for the disaster, which was also fighting 394 injuries.
At the street-dwelling ceremony, hundreds of Muslims were gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara buried in the Gulf of Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage to the macaroni.
Mr. Akram is in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrimages to the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the macara's arm raised when the macara was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for fraud.
The news agency’s English service did not present the details in question, but stated that the company’s leaders had received a ban on leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the macaroni to collapse in the court of Mari Mosche, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the haj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements on macaroni abuse and the Group's representatives have not been contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree charged the group because it did not use up-to-date security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the macaroles surround the Great Moschee in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and develops major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son, deprived of family in the 1990s.
The drought has occurred under strong winds and rain, with only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential travel at least once in the life of every Muslim fit.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided to receive a million Saudi Riali (174,000 litres) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other damages will get half of this amount.
Benefits and disadvantages of credit conversion in French francs
On the bank market, there have already been two bids to convert credit into French francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of the currency risk and the reduction of the rates.
Disappointments may occur over a period of several years, when double variable may lead to higher rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting credit in France agreed by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to the data collected by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bankpost offers three years of doubt fixed to it, of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of French credit clients due to the two subsequent reductions: it reduced the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by customers and then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the cash in it.
Both offer reduces the rates of their customers, the girl they paid equivalent monthly in them before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancopost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit cost in the CHF is to eliminate the currency risk, to protect the consumer from future growths of the franc, and to reduce the credit will be made in the currency in which you fail to pay.
Another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that the reassessment of property is no longer required, no further guarantees and another proof of income.
In practice, no new financial and legal analysis of the credit will be carried out and no additional costs will be incurred as in the case of a lender.
Both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, the girl they paid the customers before conversion, equivalent in her.
Receipts
The problem is that the rate in the first year is more than twice as much format, and the customer gets very little out of the main.
Bankpost offers with very small doubles in the first three years seem to benefit customers.
You didn't know how this double will evolve after three years.
The customer range can be more than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all credit in a variable double line is that ROBOR's indexes increase significantly in the following years (more than Libor - CHF's indexes).
For example, ROBOR in three months is now 1.44%, and in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in some days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to find other costs, mentioned in the original offer.
At the time of the U.S. Federal Reserve for Income Rate Decisions
The world is concerned about the scheduled meeting over two days, Wednesdays and Thursdays, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not profits for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters involving 80 economists, less than half of those who thought last week the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will remain one more time and that the rates of profits will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could give up zero rate and start a process of normalising profits rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, the recovery brings trillion dollars in balance and generates a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.

The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the game played by Manchester United in the League of Championships, ended with a fracture in front of the Eindhoven PSV.
After the event that brought tears to the eyes of the player and which will hold him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The accident occurred after an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno at 15 minutes after Shaw, at 20 years of age, broke off the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "There's a double fracture on the foot and it's in the hospital."
It'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then it'll be operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, faced with difficulties, then played fantastically and now something like that happens.
She wears her oxygen mask.

I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture is six months old and will not play in groups.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seems to have been lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and from giving up a plague of plague.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge by yourself when I say it's a red cardboard.
It was a very hateful intervention with two feet.

I didn't see the stage.
I couldn't see but the minge, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched her but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through something like that.
I feel so stupid. I'm so sorry.

Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the fight line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events but will have a positive attitude youth.
Moen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at test level, represents an option for the attack.
Similar Subject: Adam Lyth left the English team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Halles
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven matches against two good attackers, in difficult circumstances, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the ads were made because -- and I said this earlier -- players are their own choices.
I want fifty years and maybe Lyth would have been too long but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if you make more runs for Yorkshire, it'll be part of other opportunities.
The main trainer of the English team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not measured by his ability and didn't surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven rounds--as Sam Robson had before-- while Nick Compton had nine.
Just Compton was lucky at home and moving.
The only thing you could have done was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the best shape - but this time it's about the past.
The team comes to Alex Halles, a batsman I'm picking him up very well.
He's a cricket player who has "the X factor" and I noticed him early in Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a trick Trent Bridge.
They should be given at least the same opportunity as those before them, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner saving at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing to do with it.
I can't see why a shooter couldn't hit there and this left player has already proved he's fucking fucked up.
Maybe Moen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for this, so the difference isn't big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 matches test 38 as the first drop before I entered open in 2001.

People could judge his age--with an average of 31 to battle and 35 to the minge--and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections have chosen for teenagers.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the training team.
The name of Mahela Jayowardene, Batsman of Sri Lanka, as an consultant for test matches could be a master hit.
It's one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball chain of the tournament and will bring both energy and non-violent ambition.
I always believed that she was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, had intuition.
Sometimes, the new voices of the clothing, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring a future air into the team.
Colly Durham's co-pilot, Ben Stokes relaxes for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.

The Brexit Tabára could have won if the economy stays calm until 2017
On the last day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep the Great Britain in the EU is increasingly in the process, even without the choice of General Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corby's leadership of the Laborist Party or the TUC brings serious criticisms to Europe.
The foreigners also have such characters as Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past that - rooted in a crisis similar to that in the EU - not all being internal - some Member States are fed with the British agenda of concessions and amendments to treaties, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, with the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that neither of them would want this thing if social protection had gone wrong.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Minister and Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions of foreign capitals, present themselves before a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an outside view under the EU - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have arrived at a point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but she has been driving for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain one on the left.
It is difficult to believe that these will help the English who point out whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of the British Sea - something they don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even intend to make deliberate remarks that do not, in the style of the SNP, help in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
"Renegotiation was fixed" and "The Great Britain didn't get any value from renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin how attractive Fleet Street can be and how sceptical are the barons of the oligaric press that are about the EU with scepticism, because they have not participated in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may remember the flag of Boris Johnson, the Euro-porter, who became famous at the beginning of the 1990s when he was responsible for Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They included the mix of tax-free tax-free people, foreigners who were cheating on their phone and non-domain pseudo who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw her about the same thing, but he realized that when you're locked up in a bottle along with a nervous throat, you have to give her bananas to distract them from thinking about eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more brilliant than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair had given a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, composed of French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him an exit cardboard.
The press didn't forgive him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who got me friends behind the moon in Westminster - I told her not to waste her time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from a Murdoch strategy of Neil Kinnock's 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left a Sunday holiday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call a evolutional wave.
This states that we would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with "english" conservatives might agree with that.
This was said by Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" by Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to recognize that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as "in shade" minister on financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s when his father fought on TV to be unfaithful to his colleagues at work, without going too far and without losing his job in the office.
Hilya's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and to what the JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting last night.
Regardless of the picture Corbyn wants to transmit - keep it, raise my awareness of me - the discipline of messages remains important in the television era and especially in the future of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good care of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
However, McDonnell's and Corbyin's basic support for EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric debate among the left-wing dissidents for which narcissism of small differences is a central doctrine.
As in his NATO-Tom Watson sociology, he is open about the fact that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin withdraw political capital - and there are suspect voters - for concessions to the British Sea when everything could be useless?
THE U.S. is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Impact Security Forum, month.
Experts critical of the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic communications
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic advertising is 95% less harmful than smoking has resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of which are related to the tobacco industry.
The editors of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) magazine included Lancet's publication in criticism of the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic communications.
The PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Some researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and showed their finger to the links between certain experts and the Tunisian industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical magazine attacked "the extraordinary basis of fraglia" which founded the main conclusion of PHE.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ put their claims and their foundation "on a solid ground or on a migrating island".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said it is expected that PHE claims according to which "the current estimates show that electronic chains are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-point decision-analysis model (MCDA) to synthesis their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in research.
McKee and Capewell or said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company entitled EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco for the development of an independent study.
This has also validated BAT’s public health accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting had declared the financing received from an electronic market producer but not the financing that there were reports that it would have been received by Philip Morris International from the marketing and marketing company.
No arguments have been provided on the basis that the panel members have been selected, but among them are some "frontiers" known in the production of electronic markets, some of which even declare industry funding.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expert experience in the control of the tunnel.
The meeting was also attended by the Head of the Control Section of the PHE.
The group's research work "confirms convincingly" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have on the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that the PHE claims that "there is no evidence so far that electronic media is a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health Department, said he had previously responded to the claims of BMJ.
He said: "Electronics are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their lives is losing their lives because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health alerts is less comparable, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of the information received and the evidence not received, in particular the high level of public confusion regarding the risks related to tuna.
Each year, some 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion litres.
Explanation of current evidence - that is, although the use of electronic markets is not risk-free, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we perform our national duty.

However, a separate campaign also led to a large number of posts in bus stations and in metrics that needed a second look.
"An important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using the sources and branding of the London metro, the DLR line transforms into a tank.
In September of this year, a number of arms dealers will be released on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the end of the arms trade.
The 300 posts are performed by artists who showed their works at the Cruel Design Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.

The Kingdom of transport in London is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of a flight.

According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and conference at the University of Essex, artists ask more questions and seek to make the political work accessible to the public outside the gallery.
Many artists turn to co-operation with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out in the real world in order their art has an impact on society.

The film produced by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked for bonus, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
The VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence of the advertising for the arms market - with an open space in ExCel's calendar - and thought, "Let's offer them campaigns that try to avoid it."
They played with a more realistic claim but "invasioning it with powerful animations and colors was more exciting".
"I did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the market," says Tom Davies, named Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the British authorities to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
The most creative form of art on the subject of the arms race may come from the inside ExCeL, where exhibitions offer fantastic eufemistic products.
In a press release, Saab announced an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with U.S. support launcher."
This includes “a single focus that provides primary effects behind the arms, inside the fence.
Whatever that means, it won't be fun.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the founder of a less common project, of the right to "stranged", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - a orchestra shaped by international solos and talented musicians, which interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and this will make it the least curious in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissunances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, where soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when violinist Xavier Phillips was first found, the works of Enescu were unbaptised.
Both shows, painted on the Athens scene, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissunances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being the only classical music collection in which there was no director.
The address is the most important musician for the musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need education either to become soloists or to become an orchestra - talking about instrumentists, not composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers."
They're insinuating the impression they need a leader.
On the other hand, for the public, all music fetishing is directed.
And so, business, the music industry, there's making marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, when we look at this world, we have some qualified workers, what's stupid, and a public that can't listen, but must look, what's stupid," David Grimal said.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way music came after "the music's deceptives" from his soloist career.
I was like an athlete at another level who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I haven't found any sense of going on this road yet.
So I decided to believe the Dissoans.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did something like this without a leader: "The music world, extremely conservative, didn't want such projects".
"How do I imagine you making marketing with a collection of musicians in which there is no self?" asked the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the collection, the lack of a director has not proved to be a pity in the musical act: "I am curiously, as I sing a more complex repertoire, with so much more simple, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," argues Grimal, adding that on Sunday's show "I was 74 directors on the scene".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are the largest orchestras in the world who sing and sing three times a day, and among these orchestras you invited and this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there exists the place and interest for something different, which scatters barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognized as feeling Roman music of the Roman celebrity's brain, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into the repertoire or.
The criminal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, that is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Roman music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
The criminal army for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "the mass of musicians, as it is organized today, has an island of death" and that "the future of music represents intense music".
We don't need to do the world's tour five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
In Bach's time there were no global tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all awesome, extraordinary, as long as they're in the music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity is suffering, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave examples of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good legumes and meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws which are not good for legumes and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture reach the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music it happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
The Dissonances make the roses not too beautiful, but when the taiems are real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should be brought back into focus and that institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, it needs to be organised, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I think -- as the Koreans do, the Chinese, the Japanese -- that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I've re-entered her education in school, I've re-entered television concerts and through this education we wouldn't need to sell sub-producing music," says Grimal.
I'm sure there's things in classical music education that are very communists, that's all, it's very military.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in some way, if we want to be a musician, it's with everything else.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist Zambind.
Crime shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of music comes from just beyond this "military" status, beyond what "you think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert comes out of Zambiars".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and about the artist under "The Idea Festival", a discussion with the public organized under the International Festival George Enescu by Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal

Cinema City looking for "Mimiles Voci Mari"
Cinema City launchs the biggest challenge for children: double-dubing two characters from the superproduction "Críasa Zápezii 3D"
You got a super-talent and spontaneous kid who likes the movies?
Give her a chance to see.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they wish to reach the next ages and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Mikile Voci Mari", offering them a wonderful opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If in classical drawings the emphasis is placed on approaching the voice of the specific character of the animated person in the last period, the creation of history will also be taken into consideration by those who follow the interpretation of the voices and they are usually very well-known actors.
But cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we're leaving an innocent campaign.
We want to find the right voice and encourage the parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They will share a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the mirrors are fun.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance to become part of an actor's team," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, on 11 September - 30 September, Cinema City organises a pre-election followed by 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a record study with professionals.
All the parents need to do is access a smallvolvocimari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to record the child at the competition and prepare him for the test of voice.
In addition, one of the four films available on the platform must be selected, download the texts the child is going to read and then record by interpreting his or her double version.
Four movies about friendship, bass, magic and hope can choose competitions for support of the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Garden of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala known as 3D" and "Maya 3D Albinus".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double as many as a person of the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Críasa Zápezii 3D", which will be held in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax projections for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the major in the delivery sector, reducing the profit estimates for the year as a result of the decline in demand for transport services and increased costs for its distribution of land transport.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s actions fell by about 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the end of the Wednesday opening block.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next month, with less than 20 cents, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet survey.
Despite the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, the estimated decrease comes into force on 4 January and the larger surfaces for the transport of large or heavy packages, which will be applied from November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profits over the previous year as a result of reducing costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith stated that "the company faces a much weaker economic situation than is expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor declared that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments it made last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The action awards were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 for action by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the slowdown of revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases has sold the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the ground division has increased by 29%, but operating income has actually risen due to higher costs for large packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in income due to higher base rates, while the revenue recorded by the Freight Division decreased due to the cost of growth.
In the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $11.15.
March at low closure with 11% at year level and with 17% in front of the maximum record registered on 11 June.
With the most expected meetings in recent years, policymakers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-footed Honduran mahon month to decide whether the time has come to increase a key rate of profits for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank seating room, a wall painting will be painted by the United States.
The map is intended to remind you that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate of the U.S. labour force and maintain price stability.
But since the major economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced in March, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be decoupled by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term profit rate almost zero in force by the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicate a strong growth economy, recent global financial markets aggression could already inspire Fed officials to be careful about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a percentage.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I believe that if this is looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of profits, uncertainty about growth on the world market is sufficient to offer arguments to wait for them," she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that Fed will take, which in itself causes financial instability.
About half of the recently questioned economists from Bloomberg have predicted an increase in profit rates this week.
But financial markets are expected to both, a key indicator showing that growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the bridge if Fed increases the rate of profits, except where policymakers would slow down the strike by promising that it would take a long time to the next increase.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial media ran 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599.85.
The advance was announced by the expectations that Fed's decision factors will maintain a stable profit rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed would increase the profit rate at this time," Lonski said.
If Fed's decision-making factors do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts stated that an increase in the profit rate would calm financial markets because it would delay the uncertainty associated with the time when Fed will act.
With just one month ago, Fed seemed to be able to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow recovery of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of recovery from the US.
In the spring and early summer, Yellen stated that it was expected to increase this year's profit rate despite the high liberal targets as it would require more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by Fed as total employment of the labour force.
The paychecks presented signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to not achieve the annual objective of the central bank, Fed's decision factors said that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices found in the sandy decline.
The economy "may face higher rates and needs them, since labour market tensions," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued the currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media fell by 16% below the maximum record reached in May, as investors were afraid that China's slowdown would bring down global growth.
The market has recovered since this month, the Dow index is now approximately 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision-making factors, market aggression is added to the complex calculation of the time of growth of the profit rate.
"Without what happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would be more firm in the context of the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an expert researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to manage the best effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the U.S. economy and they almost have no data to base on further events in China," Oliner said.
The improvement of the global economy is not one of the greatest interests of the Fed, so it should not be taken into account in decision-making.
In fact, however, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been great.
The President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, simply said that Fed could "insist" the monetary expansion announced collapse on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are integrated from what is more, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress recorded in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Department of Global Strategy of Investnet Inc's well-being management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of Richmond's Federal Reserve Bank, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that appear to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Committee for the Open Market, has been a decision-making body which has supported the increase in the profit rate, such as the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has determined Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in view of the limited identification implications for development in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned on their losses.
Fed should put the financial stability problem first only in the event of a major crisis, as was the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's Committee on the Establishment of a profit rate.
The latter period does not go up on the same level, he said.
"Of course we do not want to be in a situation where we are afraid of a rise in the profit rate because the markets have become angry," Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this sense, I do not think it should take immediate action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to transmit to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to transmit the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party did not result in a significant increase in the hearing for Today.
The morning show of the Nine canal was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's fire in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts released over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascade Niagara and Cancun.
This "crossing" of the distance did not seem to contain too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise with a hearing of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, in front of Today with 339,000.
Today has recorded a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (37,000) and last March (23,000) but figures have been smaller than previous joys (343,000).
Today has mixed the difference between Sunrise and Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average hearing of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
On Saturday, September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349 000 TV and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, Parliament is not only affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

4 people lost their lives after the police pulled with rubber bullets in Nepali protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police pulled with rubber bullets in the crowd showing up against the new constitutions proposed by the country, declared Wednesday an official.
Violence occurred last night in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief of district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police forces used lacrimogen gas after which they fired fires in the air before resorting to the use of caucasian glands.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why the rubber glands, which is known to kill, are usually used as less lethal alternatives, have caused so much damage.
The shooting was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern Nepali region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would be affected by political influence.
There were also protests in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent incidents on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement to share the country in the province - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the draft constitution and officials said that the new letter could be adopted on Sunday.

Pregnancy reduction surgery may be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatment.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and baric surgery use different methods to mix stomach.
These reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, barial surgery has proved effective in type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with mild obesity with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a unit for weighting relative to height, is considered normal at intervals 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that one person is supranational and more than 30 persons with IMC are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the hard data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of baric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrointestinal gastrointestinal tract - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average IMC in individuals suffering from surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, IMC in people who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes remained close to the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those suffering from surgery, diabetes has been fully recovered by 36% and by 28%.
In the group treated with medical methods, compared, diabetes has been fully recovered by only 1% and partly by only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol "bad" "was generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of the A1c haemoglobin, which reflects the glycaemic level in time.
Researchers write that the best level of the A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
Following surgical intervention, the average level of haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, approximately 8% remained.
However, this improved “glycemic control” - reflected by improved levels of the A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to researcher chief Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastro-intestinal group, the surgical intervention group bybypass lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), recorded the most significant decreases in IMC (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c (3.1% to 2.1%) and showed a higher risk of complete diabetic remission (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weights in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, Blackstone says, from Arizona University, Phoenix University of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people suffering from bariatric surgery presented a risk of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival for patients suffering from surgical intervention, Blackstone stated that it is an optimum aspect for IMC subjects under 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point in which this work is critical, as it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower IMC group," she says without increasing the risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient's IMC reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I believe that once these genetic changes have been accumulated that have short-termed their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent an appeal to put an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current crisis of refugees in the speech she held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Oxford Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of her 10-day visit to the British Sea.
He said that, in the present situation, mankind's interests should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
It also stressed that, although amazing, the response of the countries in the Western European crisis to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria's efforts to face the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is amazing care for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks of 11 September, stating that the violent response from the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have been infected with detergenated hands in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Fraud Centre, the U.S. Anti-Fraud Centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have reached a loss of hands with a large alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Fraud Centre, cases of ingestion of the fingertip in children under 12 years of age reported to anti-Fraud Centres occurred from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately one percent of these reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drank deliberately and others did it to impress their friends or to respond to social challenges.
On YouTube, movies can be followed that present to teenagers like drunk detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers have mixed their throat with alcohol to get a better drink.
Smaller children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detector.
"A child doesn't think he does bad," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand trigger) are perfumes.
Handbrakes with capillary aroma, strength, Portuguese are the most attractive for children.
Hand detector contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially for small children, only a few hugs can cause alcohol abuse.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-trafficking centre of the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a bottle of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand-detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently engaged in school the equivalent of four hand-brained drills with horse smell, came to the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, two times more than the threshold for which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated him at the Medical Center Gwinnett outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bleeding and couldn't walk when he got to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her last night in a separate hospital to identify signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Richchey said.
"It was exciting," Ortoria Scott, Nahijah's mother, said to CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or services and no longer to leave the defect of their hands on children.
In addition to alcohol abuse, some detectives have been associated with seizures.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they touched a miner of hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities have assumed that the product contains methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students from the north of New York decided to hurt their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in class", according to a police report.
The professor is very allergic to the detergent of hands and has banned him in his course room.
The police considered the plan "unintended" and raised disciplinary problems for the school inspector.

Griffiths demonstrates noise related to misunderstanding
There were complaints of misunderstanding at Celtic, deposed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to an increased pressure in order to be prepared to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players just wait.
The absence of discounts in the course of the title brings them to the Netherlands - by Boer
The average number of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands the sum of the Celtic matches is no longer transmitted; why?"
Because I'm not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about Old Firm.
He's talking about both sides of the team and there's interest going on.
The tension is great in old firm's matches and not just the Scouts want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic is fighting in response, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The confrontation with Malmo and the further removal of the League of Champions were followed by the confrontation before Aberdeen which played in 10 people, now located at the top of the classroom with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtics had a period before and they'll come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We didn't need the support of those from Celtic because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
The validity of Warburton's reference to transfers in January
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that they suggested they would have identified some targets for transfers in January, the head of Rangers, Mark Warburton is careful when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unity of Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford said: "The January transfer period is very different from the summer."
In the case of players transferred yesterday, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe during this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes it gets worse if you bring players you don't need.
Celtic refers to Michu after withdrawal
Striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw from the expiry of the contract with Swans.

Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken to the ground after he acknowledged that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was Derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding, "I don't need to say I'm back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."

McInnes said: "There is no team to win something, in cup or league, and not win such matches."
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain's sea is rising
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged, being 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the UK total grew by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the British Sea, by 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12 000 over a period of three months, the number of currently employed is 2.612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland dropped by 74.0% - an average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of authorities has laid the foundations of a stronger economy".
It has been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, I have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force record growth and the unemployment rate.
Why I am a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be in a trap for observers from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came for the first time in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws closer to the prince, I'm afraid.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
He'd offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can be witnesses to executions in America, and because usually the requests exceed the number of places available, there is a large lotteries to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The voters themselves will watch the execution with impartiality.
I can't do this.
I'd stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, in addition to developing my own relationship with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a cane and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the owner's story as he likes it, get access.
I cried to her.
He recognized that "it could have been better," but he continued to think that they were wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But she wants to present an international report on the subject.
He thinks if he dies, advertising will help move against the capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the media file series I've been doing.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm a total target.
To that end, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out how to look at a man I like dying in vain.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the course
Peter Moody said that the Racing Victoria Stewarz tried to infiltrate a spy at his grades last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack against the Stewards and the department of integrity of Racing Victoria, claiming that it has launched a personal campaign against him, the plague that filled the gap by removing Lady Dadi from the course due to a treatment administered on the day of the course.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the course area and that he has been put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lidari Cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, it has fulfilled the words relating to the spy statements and did not want to be like "the flu that does not reach the stems".
"I didn't mean to say anything about that aspect, and I've been quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything gets rough from one time," Moody said.
He knows he's gone.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to offer them everything that's best.
From the moment he starts to believe it doesn't happen like this, I have to give up on the trainer's mission.
I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certificate.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb into an interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy out their grades.
"Fourteen months later, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were in a coma along with a man - whose name I will tell him if they are asked - and they offered to hire him at my degrees to provide information on the activity there," Moody told for Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then all should give up because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the same time and knew it today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a verbatim column and can it draw people out of the train for what's going on in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on industry?
Is my influence on industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to one side and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now could decide to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that upsets me.
I'm really sorry.
I'll put pressure on him and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's fertilization increased once with a lengthy study on the cobalt test involving Lidari and the removal determined that he could "be allowed to eat".
Moody, whose name is most closely associated with the training of the non-inclusive Black Caviar champion, has labeled the treatment rule on the day of the course as "ridiculous" after it was applied on the feet of horses a cataplasm with snow or clay, which breaks the rules.
He's breaking the course rules.
I have to take my full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees put her in the wrong mood on her feet.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the course day treatment consisting of cataplasm implementation, for which the stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the accident in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and following an accident.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley road.
Police representatives state that the driver of the vehicle has not stopped helping the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, handed over to the Shepparton police.
It seems he will be accused of running away from the scene of the accident, offering first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable position.
The Melbourne Storm trainer, Craig Bellamy, answers the opponents in the wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, named the criticisms of the platitude used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the two main favorites of the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the arbitrators allowed the players from Storm to "take them to the train" the team in Storm's winning nerves at the end of the competition that was played last night in Sydney.
The trainer from Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the contest with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called the game a "show" of the Ruggby League and said that the two teams in Queensland were not too good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's plate taxi and said that players just concentrate on "contact" when they play.
Bellamy says he broke his trust after two important coaches criticized the team, which means they were worried that Storm would win them.
"And things don't stop here--I didn't hear Trent Robinson crying out of wrestling when they beat us with the score 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks, I've actually put emphasis on contact in plates and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and clearly has a great team so likely it's not common to lose and was a shock for him.
We know how it always happens in this period of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "the soul of the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing the football "plictor".
Wayne's talking about a football ball.
And he argued the idea by comparing the Saturday game to our Friday night game and talking about how exciting the game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn't interested in even the black under the corner.
But now he's got a team that can play what I think is a palpitant football, especially because of the mean young boys.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play so.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're somehow worried about the game with us.
Now six weeks probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important matches.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a more accommodating distance relative to the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The game from Broncos was probably a good game, haven't I seen him yet, how much was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, that means a ball-and-ball game?
Or the palpitant means you take a break and don't walk?
For me, there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means I could meet him at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with North Queensland Cowboys, or Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the next Saturday's premier at AAMI Park, tickets are placed on sale starting next March, tomorrow.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get her pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she fell asleep and then got authenticated in an online e-mail service where another user sent her a series of inappropriate images with children's rights subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was asleep.
He looked up on the phone and found disturbing messages after which his mother immediately warned him.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at their address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find inappropriate images with children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophile" on the Internet before "he claimed he was a cop to scare them".
Justice Elidhi Robertson said to the Dundee court: “It has been said that it is an addiction - it is up to people to fear.
He recognized that he was doing computer research but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophile.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the images to him and the fact that he asked the person concerned to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to make it worse.
She said she's not thinking clearly when she's drinking and she wants to see images of violence and crime.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and fear and wept.
The girl saw the wrong images on the phone and the defendant was faced.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, domiciliated at Ward Road, Dundee, complained guilty of having committed or taken inappropriate photos with children's subjects, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the beginning of the 24th March of the current year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it could be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael has repeated his feelings until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on trial in this file but remained in custody before setting up for other files.
It was passed on to the record of sexual offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
It has not been hurt, but filming the fall has become violent on social networking.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by the representatives of the opposition who said they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening that Mr Mugabe would not be able to escape during his speech.
Last month he was murdered during his speech in Parliament - a speech which he repeated last March.
The head of the parliamentary movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonesse, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, warning not to interrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a secret number but it was entitled "death," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, Parliament's immunity no longer has value.
The head of the parliamentary group stated that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangari, is "anxious" with regard to threats to the transmission of politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 availability as part of its efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided into two companies, separating the computer division and printing operations with corporate hardware and services found in continuous growth.
Precise availability will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring new Hewlett Packard Enterprises a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs," said Meg Whitman, president and Director General HP, who will lead the unit after the collapse.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP at present and will have a wide portfolio of business that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business decommissioning style," said Whitman.
Acting as separate societies, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual income over $50 billion and "will focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company established in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which is the object of the activity of the production of electrical equipment and which was a guarantee from Palo Alto was called "the Silicon Valley League".
HP has passed through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computer to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the most recent in the area, based on the idea that companies focus their best attention on a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendships among men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, since the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the age of 15 years.
In 2013, suicide represented the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campagn Against Living Miserrably (CALM) named 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to put under the sign of the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the fight to the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2,000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy presence", its chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for those who are not depressed, a search for healthy mental friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
This is the communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response is almost prior to meaningful contact.
Our digital ages have doubled the need to create a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if isolation is actually what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of internal values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health more and more.
The billionaire of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The Frustration of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The staff were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The smell of Joey and Chandler's frequent clothes, the moments when they look at the football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they barely get to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
After all, people who call us do not feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to take care of yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being understood as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that reminds me of when I try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the few moments of friendship between men.
While it is very helpful for objective, external intervention through the phone, people join in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you are participating in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the film posters to celebrate the event, why don't invite your friends to a coffee at Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is spread by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - with the opportunity #FriendsFest
From Maria marches and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked March in his debut match in the League of Championships and helped PSG to put himself in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you the history of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made a debt, Paris Saint-Germany starting a series of matches from the League of Championships, with a 2-0 silent victory against Malmo in the game played on March at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes from the start of her initial match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing French champions in advance, although they missed a series of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the 61 minute.
Reaching the Group A joined by Real Madrid and Şahtior Donetzik, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the course towards the final spheres in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who missed the opportunity after being replaced by his team from his hometown and the club where he started his career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or move to the League of Championships, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference between the following classes, even if there are still aspects to be perfected throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, but I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more bucks.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remix from Bordeaux's house in League 1 on weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectioners in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine average offensive was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when Marco Verratti stepped on his way behind Malmo's defense before he jumped incredibly incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right.
But if someone like the PSG is expected to win the victory from the fingers, they have been disappointed.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national teams, with a defense of five people and two middlemen, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack wasn't impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's son who passed Kevin Trapp's post at 34 minutes.
Instead, PSG players have delayed the pace several times, given some unnecessary steps and not finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who has not missed at least five attempts in the first instance and was replaced by Cavani immediately after the game is over.
Ibrahimovic proved to be much more reasonable in supporting his colleagues, his pass since Di Maria sent her in a debt debt from Willand over at 52 minutes.
The second round was written in a final one after an hour of games, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth round of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This gol eliminated the hope of Malmo that they will rebalance the score and only a great stop of Willand from the distance for David Luiz's refusal kept the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entry to cancel a gol in advance.
The Norwegian team coach from Malmo, Age Hareide, further said that PSG was with a class over and that "the last game I played in the League of Championships was last December."
Since then, I've only played in Sweden's league, which doesn't rise at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Get down the haircut for the PSG.
They did a great game.
Glencore costs $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Elvetian miner Glencore, affected by the decline in stock prices on the freight market, saved $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said that it sold new shares at 1.6 billion pounds of silver to cover the debt.
Following the loss of 57% of its market value this year, the company is on the way to the price of the freight exchange, because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes disasters in the market.
The preferential right of subscription increased the price of Glencore's shares on the London stock market in the morning trades.
The shares ranged from 2.77% to 131.60 hrling to FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore discovered the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of a broader plan to cover almost a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company has sold new shares at 125 ochlingi price per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
It removed 1.3 billion shares, representing 999% of the group.
The concern about the rise in the Chinese economy in the long-term stagnation has led to a substantial increase in prices in the coal mine, about half and coal, copper and other mercury dropped by 20-40%.
Extensive demand for a wider global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group involved in the reform that the economy must open up more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open-ended policies," Xi said, during the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for Deopening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will replace economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state companies to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested and improved through test programs.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a regulatory-based business environment and offering a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
According to the declaration, China will also enable border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants arrived on March in Turkey's territorial waters after the ship in which they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP reporting according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is heading toward the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard has been able to save 249 people on board the ship, yet their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier, months ago, two other people died while they were trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, on weekends 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, settled across the Greek island of Pharmakonis, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transporting more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The road has recently become a popular for immigrants who want to escape the war and heavy lives of the sea, such as Syria or Iraq.

The Stewartes gave the company in court, they won and were renegotiated, and the company granted them again in 2009.

For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having material concerns about training.
They have to have one care: it's to play football as well.
Technical details shouldn't be their concern.
They must value the talent.
This is what you want to do the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.

If you want us to formalize by choosing Congress, we'll do the same.
There'll be no such emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, votes in the party, opinions in the party that give someone insecure to the government or make someone feel like someone from the party does not want the PSD to hold the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD Permanent Bureau.

With regard to women, 33% were declared satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% unsatisfied and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we'll see that boys are more satisfied.
In terms of neutral status, we see a difference of two percent.
"In the same way and in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is recorded in the low-satisfied response where we see a 6 per cent difference," says the Communication.
The study showed more than a range of Roma (26%) spending an hour or even less together, 18% spending between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study reported that "Romans feel a need for something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safe (20%), nine (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, belief 17%, place 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, important 14%, invasion 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".

Victor Piturca has failed to figure out how he separated from the Roman national team in the autumn of last year.
The election court testified that it did not understand to President FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after it took Mircea Sandu's place, and thus decided to stop the nation.
Finally, he proposed to the half of the Federation to increase his substantial salary to pay off, and he was rejected.
At this point, I'm not sorry I left the country.
Then I'm sorry, I'm leaving a job behind.
That's what I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I didn't respect, I didn't respect my job.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he knew different opinions about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, and it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything worked very well and probably changed his ideas.
That's what I wanted to go.
If you didn't want to pull, then I proposed a contract deal.
We have around 400 and a thousand euros a year, so we have about 600 billion euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if I ended up in the first place in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the premier Euro 2016.

The source quoted shows that the strategy aims to manage effectively the migration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the neighbouring states of Romania, measures are taken to manage the unity and consistency of the situations that may be identified as an illegal influx of immigrants in Romania, resulting from situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible system of admission, but at the same time will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrants or which can reach national security," adds the source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can affect immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, re-activating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and some general strategic objectives related to migration, such as the promotion of legal migration, the more stringent control of the legality of third-country nationals in the territory of Romania and the appropriate implementation of the measures of isolation and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.

The activity report of the TVR management, rejected by the Commission: Stelian Tanase risk of decommissioning
Parliament's Culture Commissions rejected Wednesday's report on the activities of the Council of the Administration of the Roman Television Society in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the withdrawal (Sentary Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one resigned.
The text of the report will be rejected by the Permanent Bureaus.
These will decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation will be made relatively soon," said the President of the Senate Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that "good sense age" as well as TVR conduct should be presented at this sitting, provided that no representative of TVR conduct was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was good to present TVR conduct because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation has been made by four CA members since yesterday, with an hour or so close that we don't know about it now, but today, after the meeting of the United Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR driving by inviting it.
I think at the moment you're called, you're hired, paid out of public taxes, and you're summoned to a committee meeting even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under Parliament," said Severin after the meeting of Parliament's Culture Commissions.
He added that during the session, the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts we saw as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would be on the day, but they didn't pay off from history.
"I remind you that not one of my fault or any of these committees has lost that agreement with banks and tax, there are clear management problems," Severin explained.
He added that once the activity report is rejected by the plenary they will follow the election for a new Administrative Board and will elect the Director-General of the Institute.
I don't know who's gonna be proposed for this job.
Men won't do it.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie, to say that there's gonna be a genius who's gonna sit here and kill himself.
I hope that those who, Parliament's plenary, by their vote, will vote in favour of people who will run TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have lots of justice and respect for the girl of the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality you have to have - I feel good about the girl who's hired because she's a bad kid who comes from employers, adverts, adjoins.
"When you also get 50, 60, 70 sexes, something is scary and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," concluded the President of the Senate Committee on Culture.
Although he did not present himself to Parliament, President-General of the TVR, Stefan Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the House of Deputies, Valerius Zgonea, asking that Parliament have a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of TV taxes.
In writing, Mr Tanase requested, on the basis of the index of TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on public television service tax, in order to update the provisions at the level of technology changes on the day, as well as to regulate the procedure for control of TV tax payments and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision which will provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTV's mandate for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of homeers.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for specific public television and CNC activities from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Cerbul de Aur, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTV will enter into financial inability in the coming months in order to ensure that labour legislation obliges the employer to implement judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and pay entitlements are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce costs with staff and TV production.
"So the transfer and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a series of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and TVR News has been closed at the end of July," says the president's letter TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be reconciled only by its own efforts.
"In addition to the support of the State institutions - Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Romana TV will be available sooner or later in the inability to carry out its public mission," he wrote.
The Head of the House of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's geniuses, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's geniuses, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the court on Wednesday, by the prosecutors of the Park on the plain Court of Appeal of Bucharest.
This is accused of tax evasion, in a file of approximately 600,000 euros, being subject to judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
This created an Axis Corporate Security SRL, his mother's tools, in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation led to the fact that, for the purposes of tax and tax withdrawals such as the state budget, representatives of a company specialised in security services services would have created an infringement circuit, formed by more commercial companies, thereby demonstrating fictitious transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in fact, have not been provided, the state budget being so damaged by approximately 600,000 euros," explained the Romanian police in a press release.
These set Sanmartean's fate.
Several Al-Ittihad clubs have established the fates of middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announced that Sanmartean de Ititihad's deployment is imminent, the printer of the former Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen anymore.
Boloni is very much Sanmartean.
Lucian plays title games and does well.
The Sections also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been even more option to bring another player, much better, but it didn't work out.
"There have been more discussions, such as with Mbark Boussouf, but nothing has been concrete," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday, the appointment of Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "against".

The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, reported Digi24.
Furthermore, the Liberals criticised Serbia's name in this function and announced that they would respond to CCR, under conditions where it has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ili Sarbu is available for 30 days, according to the law, to take his resignation from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors is no longer allowed for him to make politics.
The PSD Senator will act as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors' Court of Auditors' Court of Auditors' Court of Justice, the free arm following the repeal of Ioan Anton, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which he found to be constitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in a kitchen
As Bradley Cooper continues to play the role of a waitress in the "Burnt" film, the actor made a disvaluation that he should not have expected.
In a recent interview, it said it grew more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
It's been useless as it's been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when it worked for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, it's going on the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so that the entire childhood she had kissed with her Italian grandmother, she related ContactMusic.
Asked what plans for the future had during that period, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not quite motive for me to have a card," he said.
"I saw, things you wish I could tell you," she added, claiming that what she wanted from her childhood was implemented.
Ajuns at the age of 40 recognized himself as seeing in the near future governing, taking the pattern of Clint Eastwood, which has been taken from the government all over this village.
Ponta, accused of uncontrollable colloquies and ironic claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the harsh, early Wednesday, Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims as the Hungarian political decision is "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
" Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his ironic statements, giants across Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister sent to a communiqué.
European civilised politicians don't say that from uncontrollable chaloms.
"His comments have only one explanation: and he has lost total support in Romania's internal policy," added the head of Hungarian diplomat, according to the ICT.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and punish the behaviour of other Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a mess to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the provocations from some Hungarian government representatives.
"These are a mess to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of all kinds of minorities, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that it is the adoption of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, since brutal and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma ghimpata, aggressive laws, closures and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"Believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and in particular in the highest European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!" stressed the head of the Romanian executive.
Earlier in March, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto qualified for "simply lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, which was considered inappropriate for a leader in the twenty-first century, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomat also mentioned March as "extremist and false marks" of the Romanian Prime Minister has internal political crisis in Romania and explained that Budapest is waiting for forgiveness from the Roma side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made months ago by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and say is that I am against the xenophobic talks the idea of closing the borders, like all those who come from some terrorists, are fools of the Middle Ages and I oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics ability to treat these people like some people, not how it treats our magic neighbors, with a fight and with the insertion.
"I don't agree with that," said the head of the Romanian executive at a press conference at Targu-Juu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest decided to start field preparations for the expansion of the border with Romania of the guard building it on the border with Serbia, to make any changes to the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that the Hungarian decision to raise a guard on the granite did not solve any of the refugee problems and "evict Hungary from Europe".
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and Macaral abuse from Mecca
Saudi authorities announced that the giant healthy Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the abuse of a macarole, Friday, on the Moschee Sea of Mecca, an accident that caused the death of 107 people.
According to one investigation committee, the company did not "respect the security rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), which reported BBC.
The company's directories were banned from stopping here until the investigation was completed in this case.
The signature will also be excluded from our public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is currently led by the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group worked for four years on the extension of Mari Moschei, so that he could master more pears.
The accident occurred last night, during a storm, when a macara, probably descalibrated by powerful wind currents, collapsed on the narrow side of the cover of Mari Moschei from Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How He shut up the lips of the rebels!
Considering by many worlds the greatest Roman footballist in history, Gica Hagi was labelled after withdrawing from activity as a weak trainer, which can not be able to perform performance and in the new post.
After an unfortunate experience with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over after a year's training role in the Constanta Future, the team that patrols it.
After a year of the team's formation, the King proved to be capable of transforming a team that was fighting for rescue from retrograde in a top.
So, after a year, the Future registered with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 infringers.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which hits the European pairs.
Things took a turn and better for the Future in this season, led by the team reached the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than Astra Giurgiu's leader.
The future also has the best attack on League 1, with 20 dollars (like Astra), more than twice as much as Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and during the last period in the start team, names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared.
The club's policy has made a follow-up team for foreign teams from the Future, so Hagi has sold in this range of 1.5 million euros - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 billion euros).
Steaua tools, the Future is the only useful team in League 1, according to the data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as your EU week.
Large lists come with solutions for the EU-wide, says Christian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors of the European Centre for Policy.
In an interview agreed Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a force, and the only means of police will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we find ourselves at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it has passed, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not suitable for the situation right now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC Presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in council.
All the prosthetics said they'd have the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the JAI and any State could block any decision.
Therefore, things were very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
According to Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC is taking the initiative, and the Council adopted a 55% vote of 16 to represent 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive matter, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against the policy of opening up of Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want in many countries to appear like a "EU sending migrants to their head" reaction.
They have pointed out this, but the problem is enormous because, obviously, this valley creates a serious problem for Governor Schengen and we will probably be attending major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory collections weren't really removed, was the subject just allowed to get more apart?
Yes, on the other hand, it is about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border between Germany and Turkey, and this valley of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
It may be rejected in Dublin, according to the wishes of migrants, is the responsibility of the State in which it enters for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is capable, you can't say it's the job of Greece.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise mechanism, maybe even mandatory, to share the effort of the first?
No one knows exactly how the bonds will work if they get there.
Because it solves a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to blame Romania or Portugal, or Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be called to take over migrants: you go to the X or the Y.
It is likely that it will reach certain single filter centres, either in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
It works on this kind of solution.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries with decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience, such as Romania, where migrants' problems will increase the current of xenofob.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in emergency camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% of them have managed to leave, it's hard to get through the Mediterranean, but we're waiting for next year on a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to see it so much as a media disaster.
Talk about tar with less or greater experience.
Do you think there's a place where you really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-European culture?
Look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still trapped.
I wouldn't go to radical declarations.
Of course their integration is more difficult than in other migration values, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It has created an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the British Sea.
But half the police won't work.
To create a strong Europe and an illusory one.
It must be based on the integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more careful.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, try to appreciate the values, not to break up with a foot in Europe and with one of their countries of origin, bringing the rest of the family together, including by the spouses of the convention.
The same urgent problem for these people needs to be separated from the long term of their integration.
If others have gone into long-term integration doesn't mean we have to look at them in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, doesn't mean you're gonna get your ass back tonight and you can go back to her.
We see strengths in Europe.
The granite are closed, the walls are lifted up, controls are re-entered at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranged rules so that the pressure was too high on the plates in which the leg was placed for the first time by these migrants.
I mean, we're moving free from there, but every one of us has his problems.
In front of such a valley it can't be that way, because some trees don't make it.
When there are also emotional values, politicians will appear to do something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we have no anti-terrorist legislation much more dramatic in the EU than we had last year.
It's a valley of public emotion that's installed in both senses.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have many words, many Belgian statements from politicians found at home under pressure to be men.
And then you have the dramatic case of the child born in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
There'll be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and which was not suitable for the situation right now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a little girl who thinks that if she pulls a needle on her eyes and you stick your ears, the subject disappears.
In the face of the reality of the values of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your problem.
We have done this, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask you to be treated as your EU's seventh.
You're not, you're not playing at your great level.
Great tears come with solutions for the EU-wide, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
That's how Poland did it.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite for the Romans for Schengen will be very low.
President Johnnis says it may be good that we haven't already entered.
So we're going through the opening of the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the target branch.
There is certainly a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't get into Schengen anymore, but we're gonna be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but in the sense that external borders will become joint responsibility, it will be the only rules of acceptance of migrants, the single rules of transport for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for safe routes.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved his attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between those two focusings, a game in Russia?
Russia has a frustrated behavior.
She thinks it's a great power to hit Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Take the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have collapsed in the past.
And it was good to get dressed before the main or the opposition was the Islamic State.
For two years it was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate and Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic State grew up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to be each.
Russia could have complicated things, but it can't take part in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot shut them down.
But you're strong only if you have the solutions.
The game on the off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting to make her offer, push him on the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don't come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in some way or other things created by it.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than it is.
Which button will appear in the future
Millions of Facebook users have been familiar with the "Like" button, and now representatives of the socializing network are preparing another opposition, the "Dislik".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available in the future, reports New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg explained that the "Dislik" button will show a deeper look at what a user feels than a simple option.
However, advertising or raising problems like Facebook could become a little less friendly.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid moments when someone post an account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislik".
Network users, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the possibility of expressing negative emotions or feeling sad.
Mark Zuckerberg added that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"Maybe you don't feel comfortable giving like those posters," said the representative of Facebook.
The choice of a new button on Facebook has not been welcomed by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and socializing networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted on this subject.
"You're going to give 'Dislik' to 'Dislik' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, admitted that there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social analyst at the eMarketer company, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
More, she supports it, the election campaign approaches America, and the "Dislik" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary only accepted March 70 migrants, one of my people coming to the table at its southern border with Serbia, announced government councillor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency stand during the second day of the border with Serbia due to the refugees flow, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a guard at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
Measure back a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they're going to seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to eat asylum.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian refugee minister Alexander Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, announced the police months.
In addition, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa competed in Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the Judiciary Council is on its way.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, can be attributed to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The Jewish Council's seat on the road Vasile Aleksandri will be able to give ourselves.
In one and a half years since the consolidation and functioning of the building had to be completed, the work had not reached half.
A recent phase in the construction era was consumed in the past days when the National Council for the Settlement of the Contests (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to enter into the contract of carrying out the technical project for the work that is yet to be done.
The original project was initiated by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the work, negotiation procedures were required without publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, after updating the technical project and then organizing a new job tender.
"The negotiations have not been finalised through a contract, CJ considering that the proposed form would have been neglected by the institution," Răzvan Timofcic summarized, representing the public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked by the Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This doesn't mean that CJ can start looking for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, just after a final sentence of this case, to be able to take into account the finding of another projector.
Thus, the building’s consolidation works could be resolved by the next year.
Our goal is to start things as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofcious said.
The consolidation of the former police station headquarters began in 2011.
A first job contract was launched in April 2012, after 4,5 million of its work was carried out.
The tender has been cancelled, the contract has been assisted by Moldovaconstruct SA.
However, the company has entered into insolvency, and this contract has been dissolved, after payment of 1.5 million of it.
The work has so far been done in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalization and maintenance of the building was assessed at 7.7 million.
"Come on, I'll tell you everything!" - a statement that could criminalize the former chief of Cadastrus.
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Cadastru Office signed an agreement on recognition of the facts against both prisoners.
The most likely, its statements will criminalize the other accused, in front of the former chief Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Office of the Cadastrus and Real Estate (OCPI) You are accused of DNA in a corruption file and recognized it as tele.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court, which decided to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of continuous intellectual fraud and agreed to execute two years in both cases, as well as work in the use of the community.
With regard to Dascalu's imputed facts, the prosecutors explained that it, as counsellor of the Cadastru Office, "has misled several acceptanceal processes by selling services contracts in the previous key by O.C.P.I.. Out with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The Agency for Dastro and PFA Topography SRL and PFA Lipșa Čtefan, which witnessed that the services were actually carried out, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not submitted to O.C.P.I.I.
The past days, formerly head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other unemployed or current OCPI employees were sent to the court in this file, the charges being service discounted to the companies mentioned, although the work has not been carried out.
Before the trial, it's over 300,000 of her.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only find a major handball competition in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
President of the Romanian Federation of Handbal, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, it is a great honour that our country has three teams in the Campions League groups.
With regard to Romania's national female handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but to this end it must take two stages of hunting, first of the World Championship and second of the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu added.
We really want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements on the part of Thomas Ryde's led technical staff.
A staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second, medical, two massages, porter training, physical preparation, head of delegation.
They asked us to get some things to qualify, more precisely material for physical preparation, which I never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympic Games... and I'll do everything I can to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's lots, lots of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because we're at the time of the stone with the preparation.
"The teams with which we are baptized have these materials and for a while," said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and our country's ability to compete with a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is important to be put under the sign of a European Gymnasty Championship.
Let's not forget that other crops in the world have built Olympics throughout a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona was a cave of caves, and now a beauty repertoire has arrived.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic organization was successful and in terms of investments.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can find a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball agencies are willing to agree Romania to organise a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatău went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it was very soon revealed that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, we told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said that they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest and then we specifically discussed it.
"So we have all the openings, and EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," explained the FRH official.
The great handballist refused to assess the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I asked all trainers to be booked in provisos, that if they don't comply with them, they will return to them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbists start on September 23, against France
Captain of the national team of rugby, Mihai Macovei, said, Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the components of the Romanian fleet are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We're ready."
Both me and my colleagues are with engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best dating in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are tough and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see it.
But I'm sure if we win with Canada, the game with Italy will be our end.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's a meeting of so many working years.
I don't want to disappoint anyone from the gang and come home with nice results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as the rugby in Romania, represent the three-colored pride," Macovei said.
Romania's national team elector Lynn Howells, who is in the first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the Ruggby election: "It's a great honor for us to take part in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it's very important that every game make the Romans proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitraš, believes that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in Rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I want sportsmen to succeed, and I'm sure we'll be at the end of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years of age, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends who set you up to make a dream," Dumitraš said.
At the World Cup of rugby in England, Romania will evolve into Group D by programmed the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins Friday, at the Twickenham stadium in London, with the game England - Fiji from Group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at Al.I. Cuza University
You can learn about the arrangement of flowers in a vase, painting in a tube, but also a light study on the beautiful arts of the Red Sea country you can learn at courses organised by students from outside.
The Japanese Cultural Students Circle in Iaşi organises new Japanese culture courses (kiebana, Sumie and beautiful arts) in the period October 2015 - June 2016, courses for both beginners and people.
These will take place at the Centre of European Studies at Al. I. Cuza University of Yaşi and are organized to promote Japanese, traditional and modern art and culture.
For these there is only one 50-day participation rate per person month.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I proposed to you were designed as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to art self-awareness.

14 million of her gifts to the Hospital "St. Spiriton" from Iaşi to budget correction
What's going to be purchased with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiriton" received from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction, approximately 14 million of it.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and management of clinics, but also in the medical equipment and technical equipment for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology device, with six strokes used for surgical intervention, six corresponding ATI cartridges, an ophthalmological microscopic and other devices needed to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million tons of hospital money will be directed towards construction and threat of the "Marel Ars".
From the money from budgetary correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernisation tasks in the main throne.
"In addition, in the following days we will receive works from the peer who binds the UPU to cardiology, hepatitis and gastroenterology clinics to ensure proper transport of the UPU patient in nearby clinics," explained the medical unit's manager.
The hospital will soon have in court and the Mother's Dermatology Clinic, which will organise it in the ambulance, in the same form as it currently works.
The clinic will function in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are found in the ambulance and will have approximately 30 cartridges.
The tail, made of RATP controllers and a fan.
The suffering of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither me nor my wife nor I will ever die in your city again.
Without it, they were affected by the information generated from the lungs, by the neglect of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by an amendment "as the law says".
The wives arrived in Yaşi after a few days, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for full-time tourism.
They also received a fill in which the RATP traces were passed.
"Drama" with these cards, the wives visited Yasul.
But two days later, found in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't toned with tickets at the station near the Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on canvas: that I can take tickets via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Adults in full, they rode in a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions from the full.
Unfortunately for them, it made a team of RATP controllers appear.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
The EU OF WHERE DID I KNOW WHAT WAS written in the local press, I'm coming with one evening before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it wasn't their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one amendment instead of 2 (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to miss the day of my visit to the yard and the statements there!" Ovidius says.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the information collected by the plaintiff and the controllers who "have applied the law to blood".
It's not right, and I've done a meeting at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the idea is that I felt it.
Ghinion for the Vaslui rapists.
They've had an accident and they've been in a preventive arrest.
The process of the seven criminals from Vaslui was moved to the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The foreign magistrates ruled the first term of trial in a non-public sitting in which the seven young people accused of beating a 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the beginning of the trial sitting, one of the judges who had been handed over the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for withdrawal, which was allowed by his colleagues from the court.
The judge has been active until the spring of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the President of the Section on Nale, being the one who, on 9 April, allowed a complaint of four of the accused to be held in custody at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete one that is part of the Maricica Mitellu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, Dr. Dan Anton had filed a verdict, because his daughter was in a condom relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists would remain in preventive detention.
Your young people will remain in prison for at least 30 days, when Jews who will rediscover the possibility of their release.
The final trial will take place at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iaşi, the doubt that the Violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the Pácurari cartel, the car entering Iaşi per cent.
The Iveco car user who had been transported by the seven rapists hit a Volks van bus that came out of the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
Double circle inside the end of Easter.
The car entered Yaşi here because the Penitentiary Administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Yaşi to Grajduri, then to the headquarters.
They've cut the road like this for a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrests called for another transport to take the detention.
Recently, at the scene of the accident a car was sent from the Maximum Security Penitentiary Iaşi, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer them to the other two, the guards surrounded the rear of the ship, and the arrests came out fast, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as the drivers of the two cars have been understanding kindly about the damage to be paid," said Commissioner Mádálin Žaranu, of the IPJ.
The Mariles of Migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say from the outset, clearly and rescinded: those who did not have 7000 refugees who should and should naturalise Romania represent, in themselves, a insignificant number, but would rather be compared to the ability of the Romanian State to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of approximately 1500 souls, we are far from well beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if these migrants will even agree to be established in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are very small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasis of interlops and paralysed by a Venezuelan political class, the Romanian state proves to be impotence in all areas.
The inability to integrate them on tignons is just a trivial example.
In addition, any colour governments have been unable to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or schools, provide decent medical assistance, drive the road, create jobs that are respected or keep their youth at home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they are fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt.
We are first hit by the balconies of the EU's strong states, which prove maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the difficulties with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of rubies scattered around the world, do not yet accept it in another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably not to steal any national character.
Finally, there is also a misunderstanding of many migrants, who, although calling for only the horrors of the war as a cause of departure, do not accept the destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplified mode in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken into consideration.
The causes must be eliminated, support one another and, strictly dealing with the book of political justice, seek peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more inside, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has appeared to us as an accelerated, depleted and more than a situation.
I stressed that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that the EU does not have any future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
So, what else does the EU use if the only advantage that Romanians enjoy - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the values of refugees crossing borders as well?
At some point, the Syrian war will end.
But not the crisis of migrants.
In recent decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource mobilization, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With politicians as well, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will happen.
Seven thousand euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practical, imposed
The grant invitation to tender refers to a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it was closed, the club at the court of the Roman Literature Museum is offered by the Judiciary Council for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful 134 mp surface, at two levels of roughness.
The CJ accepts as the destinations of the building only those of the literature, library or other cultural profile activities.
The construction was assessed at EUR 68,300, the value of the launch of the tender being EUR 6,830 per year, with a 25-euro bid.
The grantor will have to continue and continuously operate the building and cover the entire costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the following technical project.
"The construction of the Pogor Club is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the public food unit has worked and no longer evacuated, there has been no current repair and maintenance work as necessary at the time of the operation of a building", states the relevant documentation of the tender procedure.
The award offers of the club are expected until 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomeshti have had a sleepover.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds from Tomešti, brothers, have added more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills at home and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother is following treatment, and the drugs have not been hidden.
The children were rushed to the hospital "Saint Maria" in Iaşi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
In 20 years he received a bold gift: biological parents
He died in a hospital in the dark of the '90s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and unaccompanied, and then adopted by a family established from Italy, in the same year when the adoption was regulated, a young man out of the country, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met up with biological parents in a courthouse, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything else.
Crina will fulfill these 20-year-old days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo were thinking about offering their beloved daughter a lovely and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to get to know the past.
"The Fire of Iaşi", who has been involved in the efforts to find the family of origin after some extreme wave indexes, has been a witness to these meetings that are practically breaking your heart.
The relationship between the rapporteurs, the emotions of the moment, the statements of those involved, their reactions are to be moving and complex.
The story of Crine now begins 20 years in the eastern Ruginoas area when it was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there were disagreements between parents, and Mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I haven't known anything.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was taken in with her grandmother to Pascani's municipal hospital, and still the daughter's father, Costa Balkans, went to work in the city of Alexandria, the Teleorman judge.
Their lives were definitely to be separated.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After entering, Crine's father went to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, found her no longer.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"It'll be thought she's abandoned," says a family nepo.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the child's fate all the time, it has been taken by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Children's Protection, which then gave it to the Centre for Plasament in Bucium.
There were years in which abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadoran and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They loved the place of Crina's blonding, and after a while she had to move definitively with her in Italy.
The small number of cases have already been committed for nearly two years, as long as the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt that she was our daughter.
"It's like my wife would have given her life," says Salvadore, adoptive father, while she gets into the palm of the girl's palm.
In the country, the parents of Montenegro, Alina and Costa Rica continued to separate their search wherever they could.
The father asked the Ruginoas authorities, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then sent him that it is possible to be deposed, but the Eishi parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told the court that she was leaving for Italy in Palermo.
And the conditions for looking for her were gone.
We asked God to be good.
I've been thinking about her all the years they've been through, but it wasn't possible to hang out, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in her biological mother's eyes.
But even if years have passed, Ruginoas' parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past is related to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says happily.
And her dream turns out to be real.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrog Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvador's desire to find Crinine's biological family.
And the search just started with a name.
After the request we had from our Italian partners, I started the first deceleration.
We just got a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginoas.
In the short time I had a primary activity there, and I could ask if there was locally the received name.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't also looking.
"It lasted for about a month until we found the daughter's biological father," explains the chief Romano Ichim.
In total, it took the authorities three months to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially since each had its own home in another location.
We started dating somewhere in March, and in June-July we ended up identifying biological parents and discussions.
"Then I established that in September there was a first meeting," added Roman Ichim.
Last week, Alina and Costa saw for the first time the lost girl on the hospital halls of Iaşi, 20 years ago.
The father, emotionally exhausted, could barely manage his tears, and his hands could not hold back.
He's just changing a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep too much.
He was all excited, scared.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," she tells us suddenly, she and Costica from Ruginoa.
Meeting with Crina with her mother and her biological brothers
In his discussions with his daughter, who is next to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costa Rica Balcan told her, among others, that if she ever wanted to come back to him, in the sand, she would come quietly: she could give him something or her hat, so that she could find a boy from the sand and bury a lady.
Mom's and she's excited, crying, and she's hard to believe that something like that can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like that could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking all these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit us in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," says with great tears on Alina's masterpieces, Crine's mother, while a servant holds his hand.
In him he hides his tears more happily, because soon he will see his daughter after such a long time.
On the other hand, Crina, who's going to fill in over a few days this month, 20 years old, tries to relax like an emotional child.
He doesn't know what to expect, but he's got a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks I'm young, but now he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to challenge.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It'll be a nice meeting, a great experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First Family Meeting in Iaşi
In the Single Market, under the dawn of autumn, the Ruginoas family re-enters their destination with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing her school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
It's not just a barrier or country. It's just a barrier. It's a language.
There, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Yaşu has passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind, and that in the future, if the occasion takes place, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this sort organized, also emotional burden, and I'm glad it's a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am still asked for such an event, I will make it very expensive," said Roman Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Council.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, separates by history.
I mean, they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone takes their soul
The boards from the East PSD branch closed an armistice at the foot.
Following the following round of discussions, carried from Friday to Sunday, first being and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
Pressed by the Executive President of the party, Livio Dragnea, to present a unified position, the outgoing social democracy will send it a full list of potential candidates to the functions of the party.
Apart from being closed, the internal war in the party seems to have taken just one break to allow the combatants to take their souls.
The dragon didn't give a finalum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under current conditions: try to find a solution to not put the party at risk.
On October 3, we have a party election.
All functions will be available to those who want them.
"In the meantime, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim prime minister, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions on the weekend went only to the conclusion that nothing was established.
At the October elections, for the role of the President of the PSD's judicial branch, an open competition is expected.
On the short list of potential candidates for the main function of the party's East Office, the State Secretary is Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazár, Judge Vasile Cathea and the interim President of the Judiciary Council, Victor Lupu.
This could also be added by the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
An option taken in the calculation is also the candidate for the leader of the PSD judge, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be present, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the recent negotiations is the former branch leader, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the Statute, including on the election day, candidates can be filed, and no one would look at them if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judiciary and all our leadership structures," explained How.
Until the internal elections are organised, the leadership of the PSD judicial branch will be ensured by Victor Lupu, a close friend of Nichta and Stancius.
However, Lupu is released until 29 September, preparing the elections in practice to be ensured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, Judge Mihail Popescu, in close relations with the Nichita tabla.
Phone contact, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It reached a partial consensus in support of a unit team to be held in court.
"There are, on the other hand, more variants about the candidates' intentions to the PSD Iași presidency, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
A former judge rejected the files of the Vaslui rapists for concubinage
The seven young people of Vaslui's trial sentenced to violence today arrive at the Court of Appeal of Iaşi.
The vasluens sentenced to imprisonment between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the Court of Justice of Vaslui has established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of the last week, Judge Dan Anton, making a request for resignation, authorized by his colleagues.
Anton appealed to the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, attorney Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concussion, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Reasoned the Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge of Vaslui's Court of Justice who condemned the seven young people motivated the verdict.
For this reason, the judge speaks of the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported him, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of anger in the public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the imposition of a preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private measure of freedom, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, has been subjected to a strong sense of anger at the level of the local and national community as regards the fact that persons accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," states the motivation of the Vaslui Court.
In addition, the magistrates have also deposed the main defence of the seven accused who during the trial have called for the fact that the girl they raped would not be "the door of church".
"The tribunal underlines that the moral quality of the accused person is irrelevant, as the defendants wanted to demonstrate by their defenses, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
By Saturday maybe a little world knew in Romania who's Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the British Navy Labour Party, many are wondering how the election of a politician can affect us, which, in turn, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader left of post-war workers.
Marxist stated, anti-monarhist (at a time when Tony Blair, then prime minister, asked for the release of a royal family from Buckingham Palace), an anti-American anti-American and a sympathizer from Vladimir Putin (he was also invited to comment on political events by the Russian television channel "Today"), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wanted the British to abandon nuclear weapons and come out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered Osama bin Laden's murder at the time, a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
According to the model of all popular demogies, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
The kind of things he said and promised them and Tsipras in Greece until he stepped in with the real world and economic laws.
The new labor leader's economic programme provides, among other things, massive renationalization and money-laundering as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not uniformly adopted on the globe, I then had a global general prosperity! but who would forbid such details.
Of course, we can tax them with blood on the banks, become some kind of enemies of the service of the left, but from what has been seen so often in the past not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Holland.
The additional sums are quickly covered by generous promises, without coverage, made by popular demoggioses.
As Margaret Thatcher well drew attention, "Socialism's problem is that at one point money ends elsewhere."
At least I'm giving Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever get to the prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another radical leader on the left, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the leader leader of the party, failed unfortunately in the election.
And then there is still a working class in the British Sea, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the labour force as a whole, and extensive automations have made it necessary for the industry to be highly qualified, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in the face of opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest financial number, Corbyn's election is considered to increase Brexit's chances, according to the release of the British Mari from the EU.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the far left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by radical right, with anti-immigrance rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees who emerge from the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if after the referendum, which should take place by 2017, the British decided to leave the Union’s loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep failures created within this Euro crisis and now the refugees, between the North and South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a contrast to the French-German axis (in which Berlin becomes increasingly dominant).
It is true that the British business environment, City, are strong lawyers of the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe is no longer the past.
There are many feelings, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just had a recent exhibition in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends to make major decisions over the head of the majority of Member States, consulting only a few European powers, especially Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system training, anti-immigrants which are at the same time and Eurosceptic are increasing spectacular across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative burden has reached higher levels than in the past.
From where and the conclusion it draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves national interest.
If voters will take the decision of the brain, then the Great Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
But Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will be involved in a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and in that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Siriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its popular rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, the general social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the double crisis, the Euro area - immigration, both of which have been driven by premise decisions that have not taken into account but the integrationist political ambitions, not and the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, conflicts on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania more.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complex situations.
Constantine Brancusi, the country god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
The Whiteman says, "Take and measure the workshop!"
The Great Sculptor had a great purpose: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
In the background of his fame, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, networks for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "work."
What do you write about Constantine Blancuis?
What else to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the notes.
And, soon, a famous bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in a press clip.
Whites produce and deliver money almost 60 years since it's no longer between us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulvards that bear their name.
Also, even the author of this text is located on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the adults, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park in the White House."
The country is charged with its statutes.
There are few Romanian personalities whose work is to be known by such a world from children to adults.
Brankuși's infiltration capacity is a giant.
No communists have been able to extract it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its readers today pay for the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of characters and shares.
And, then, again, what else would it be to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to rebuild their destiny, Brankuşi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, they're the people who tell you that if you weren't lucky to be born in some big city and in a family as old as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brankuşi's life is a perfect example.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe this is where the next text should be started.
With a sense, whatever they are.
Look at the success stories of crretins, which are delivered daily to you in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
You want to know how to make a living, how, today, about him hearing a whole map?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantine Brankuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobzia, a small village of Peštišani, Judge Gorj, on the Isle of the Carpathies.
He's the fifth child of Mary and of Radu Nicolae Blancusi.
Although it comes from a family of mature countries, Brankuşi leads a modest life, but one of them has to work together with the repertoires that will guide his artistic vision later.
Recalling his childhood and the places in which he grew up, the artist was to witness, in a meeting with Petre Túuscia from Paris in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious".
Thousands of people went, happy, a patriarchal life.
It's all lined up from one anonymity to another.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brankuşi's childhood was far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculpture of years spent in the homeland.
The moment is replayed at the work "Brancuși. A biography," written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Blancui was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was done "at the casino", following those who drain the liquid to see if the process is going to take place as necessary, Brankuși takes a moment of general neglect.
He fills his pocket with the palm leaves with milk and water on his leftovers.
He fell asleep almost instantaneous.
The first people watch in just a few minutes.
Mom gets into panic, then into the nursery, thinking her son's dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, comes back from life with tears, he sees from the distance the desperate signs of those waiting for him with the breath of his mouth.
The party is turning into a party immediately.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds it good to call her Baba Branduša, doftoroai and the branch servant of the Brankuši.
The nurse checks the baby's breathing, then puts it under her nose with a ball of horse, collected from the front.
The strong foreign child.
The world is crying.
While the boy is allowed to sleep longer than his drink, joy, the party with laurants continues with more strength.
The second day, the father and the son meet by the elevator.
Radu Brankuși makes Constantine gather some new ones and bring them.
The father does this to his son's head down and, with the nine boys brought down, beats him to keep his mind.
And, while she's feeling the noise of the hits, the little Blancui has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that the things around her may appear distorted.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as if he would recognize the age, if he did not have the same as the astrologer involved in his illness.
Was the sun just as sick as his father was about what happened to her?
At the current hour, the city does not work
A parliamentarian calls politicians to remind them of those who voted against them.
Independent Member Viorel Blăjuz appealed to PSD and PNL to stop internal wars and redirect their agenda to the elected.
What we see now on our political scene is a big mess and so on.
I haven't seen any of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
Not a highway, not a Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians argue as much as possible on the basis of real estate interests.
Let's just leave a little bit behind the politics, gather together, and talk.
At this moment, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blajuz said.
He appreciated that the current political class has devastated the foreign electorate, resulting in a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing the party's faithful electoral practice.
He also believes that voters will all be directed towards the traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, as is the "Pentru Yași" party that will be launched today.
The local parties have very little chance and will only break away from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civil active people, who are on the right.
"It is also more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blajuz.
He explained that he is not interested in a candidate at the future local elections, dismissing the calls for his intention to be enrolled for the Prime Minister.
I said I don't want to apply for any local function.
I'm still wondering if you'll continue as a member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iaşi and in the debate on the halls, with other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to take my picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're willing to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjuz said, who appreciated that the main reason why the elector is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the voters.
A colleague from Daddy said he didn't get the money and he had to get off the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes it's hard for me to raise my money from the camp.
At the end of the term of office, I will report on everything I have spent, except for the salaries of staff from the office and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in one month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, housing and other expenses.
"Tell a MP I don't get money is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuz concluded.
